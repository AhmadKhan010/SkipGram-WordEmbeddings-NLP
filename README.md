# 🧠 SkipGram-WordEmbeddings-NLP

**A compact end-to-end NLP pipeline for legal judgement summarization.**

This repository implements **OCR-based PDF preprocessing**, **Skip-Gram word-embedding training from scratch (NumPy only)**, and both **extractive** and **rule-based abstractive summarization**.  

The **abstractive summary** is generated by refining the extractive summary using **POS tagging**, **NER**, and **frequency analysis** to identify key subjects, actions, and descriptors, then merging redundant phrases for a concise, fluent result.

## Project Overview

### Goal
Build a **reproducible pipeline** that:

1. Extracts text from PDF court judgments using OCR  
2. Cleans and splits text into sentences  
3. Merges and prepares dataset (JSON / JSONL) for training  
4. Trains a **Skip-Gram neural language model (NumPy)** to learn word embeddings  
5. Produces:
   - **Extractive summaries** (sentence ranking via cosine similarity)  
   - **Short rule-based abstractive summary** derived from extractive output

### Constraints
- **No pretrained models or third-party embedding libraries**  
  (No Hugging Face, Gensim, Word2Vec, Sentence-Transformers)
- **Allowed libraries**:  
  `numpy`, `nltk`, `spacy`, `pandas`, `pdf2image`, `pytesseract`, `Pillow`, standard Python libs

## Quick Start — Requirements

```bash
Python 3.8+
```

#### Install required packages:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas nltk spacy pdf2image pytesseract pillow
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## Step-by-Step: Run the Pipeline

Run commands from the repository root. 

####  1. OCR + Extract Text from PDFs
```bash
python "Data Preprocessing/Extracting_data_from_pdfs.py"
```

####  2. Merge Multiple JSON Outputs (Optional)
```bash
python "Data Preprocessing/merge_jsonl_script.py"
```

#### 3. Preprocess for Skip-Gram Training
```bash
python "Model implementation/preprocess_and_save.py"
```

#### 4. Train Skip-Gram Model (NumPy) & Save
```bash
python "Model implementation/train_skipgram_with_minibatch.py"
```

#### 5. Generate Extractive & Abstractive Summaries

#### Function: 

summarize_with_model(jsonl_file, model_path)

#### File: 

train_skipgram_with_minibatch.py


Example Usage (Python REPL or script):


```bash
from train_skipgram_with_minibatch import summarize_with_model

summarize_with_model('test.jsonl', 'skipgram_model_lr0.3_bs16.pkl')
```

#### Steps:

1. Load model & word2idx

2. Compute sentence embeddings (avg of word embeddings W1)

3. Build document embedding (mean of sentence embeddings)

4. Rank sentences by cosine similarity → extractive summary

5. Use spaCy rule engine → short abstractive summary
