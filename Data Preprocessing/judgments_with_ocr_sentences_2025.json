Through the instant petition for\nleave to appeal under Article 185 (3) of the Constitution of Islamic\nRepublic of Pakistan, 1973, the petitioner Syed Basit Hyder Taqvi has\nassailed the impugned order dated 07.02.2025, passed by the High Court\nof Sind at Karachi whereby his petition for concession of pre-arrest bail\n\nwas dismissed.\n\nZ. Briefly, the case of the prosecution is that the complainant:\nMustafa Hussain lodged an FIR stating that he is an advocate by\nprofession and he was owed a professional fee in Special Case\nNo.215/2015 by Syed Basit Hyder and Syed Ameer Hyder. The accused\nissued him cheque of three million while remaining 45 lacs through three\nother cheques which were sent to him through WhatsApp. The\ncomplainant is aggrieved by the dishonor of cheque No. 22308272 in the\n\nCri. P. No. 39-K/2025.\n\namount of Rs. 30,00,000/- and three other cheques in the amount of Rs.\n15.00.000/- that were issued by the accused for the purpose of fulfilling\nan outstanding financial obligation with respect to the payment of\n\nprofessional fees.\n\n3. The matter before us concerns whether an advocate may initiate\ncriminal proceedings against a client for failure to pay outstanding\nprofessional fees, particularly with reference to Section 489-F of the\nPakistan Penal Code (P.P.C.). In addressing this question, the Court\nmust consider the sanctity of the counsel-client relationship, the\nprinciple of privileged communication, and the legal implications that\n\nflow from the non-payment of fees by a client.\n\n4. It would be pertinent to note that the learned counsel for the\npetitioner submitted a copy of the judgment dated November 7, 2024, in\nConstitution Petition No. D-2230 of 2024, which was passed by the\nlearned High Court of Sindh. The judgment details the cases lodged by\nthe Advocates against their clients, indicating the aforementioned trend.\nThis is a significant development that necessitates immediate attention.\nThe AIGP Legal report that was submitted to the High Court is\n\nreproduced below:\n\nREPORT OF FIRs LODGED BY THE ADVOCATES/LAWYERS AGAINST\n(A) THEIR CLIENTS (B) THIRD PERSONS (C) POLICE OFFICIALS |\nFROM 01.01.2024 TO 31.10.2024\n\n\nCri.

The aforementioned data is not only alarming but also impedes the\n\nefficient administration of justice. The entire judicial system would\nundoubtedly collapse as a result of such a trend. The effective\nadministration of justice is contingent upon the establishment of a\nrelationship between counsel and client that is based on trust, mutual\nrespect, and confidentiality. Throughout the world, the profession of\nadvocacy is regarded as a noble profession, and it is incumbent upon\neach member of the bar to uphold the highest standards of professional\nintegrity, confidentiality, and values. The Pakistan Legal Practitioners\nand Bar Councils Act, 1973 and its implementing rules have been\n\nestablished to safeguard this sacred relationship and maintain the purity\n\nCr. P. No, 39-K/2025.\n\nof the legal profession. These regulations also mandate a high level of\nprofessional integrity, confidentiality, and values. Rule 155 of The\nPakistan Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils Rules, 1976 reads as\nunder:\n\nRule 155. Controversies with clients concerning compensation are\nto be avoided by the advocate so far as shall be compatible with\nhis self-respect and with his right to receive reasonable\nrecompense for his services. Any law suits with clients should be\nresorted to only to prevent injustice, imposition or fraud.\n\nSimilarly, American Bar Association Model Code of Professional\n\nResponsibility says as under:\n\nEC 2-23. A lawyer should be zealous in his efforts to avoid\ncontroversies over fees with clients and should attempt to resolve\namicably any differences on the subject. He should not sue a\nclient for a fee unless necessary to prevent fraud or grass\nimposition by the client.\n\nLikewise, Article 9 of the Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 reads as\n\nunder:\n\nArt.9. Professional communications: No advocate shall at any\ntime be permitted, unless with his client’s express consent to\ndisclose any communication made to him in the course and for\nthe purpose of his employment as such advocate, by or on behalf\nof his client, or to state the contents or condition of any document\nwith which he has become acquainted in the course and for the\npurpose of his professional employment, or to disclose any advice\ngiven by him to his client in the course and for the purpose of _\nsuch employment: Provided that nothing in this Article shall\nprotect from disclosure-\n\n(1) any such communication made in furtherance of any illegal\npurpose; or\n\n(2) any fact observed by any advocate, in the course of his\nemployment as such showing that any crime or fraud has\nbeen committed since the commencement of his employment,\nwhether the attention of such advocate was or was not\ndirected to such fact by or on behalf of his client.\n6. The counsel-client relationship is fiduciary in nature, as indicated\nby the combined reading of the aforementioned legal provisions. Any\nattempt to violate this trust by requiring a counsel to disclose privileged\ninformation or to initiate criminal proceedings against a client would be\ninconsistent with the principles of justice and fairness. In general,\ncounsel is prohibited from initiating criminal proceedings against a client\nfor non-payment of legal fees, as these disputes are civil in nature. The\nprofessional conduct emphasizes the ethical resolution of fee disputes\n\nthrough civil remedies or dispute resolution processes. In order to\n\n» Crl. P. No. 39-K/2025.\n\nprevent ethical violations, conflicts of interest, or reputational damage,\ncounsel must exercise caution. Abuse of process is defined as the use of\ncriminal proceedings or threats to secure payment. Lawyers are\npermitted to withdraw from representation for non-payment of fees after\nproviding reasonable notice; however, they are prohibited from employing\n\nthe prospect of criminal action to exert pressure on the Client.\n\nTe It is important to note that in the present instance, if the client has\nfailed to make the full fee payment, the amount may be recovered\nthrough civil remedies. However, the initiation of a criminal case against\none's own client should only be considered in exceptional circumstances\nwhere no other remedy is available. A failure to pay for a service, such as\nlegal representation in this instance, does not necessarily result in penal\nconsequences. A state of consciousness that is culpable is the essential\ncomponent of criminal liability. Dishonestly issuing a cheque is\npunishable with up to three years' imprisonment under section 489-F of\nthe PPC, and the courts have consistently maintained that this offense\nnecessitates rigorous examination. Alternative remedies are available\nunder civil law, such as a claim for compensation for loss or injury\nresulting from breach of contract under section 73 of the Contract Act,\n1872 and a suit for recovery under the Civil Procedure Code, 1908. The\n489-F of the PPC provision is intended to function as a safeguard against\nfraud, rather than as a blade to enforce civil recovery. Mens rea\n(dishonest intent) must be established in order to incur penal\nconsequences, and criminal proceedings under 489-F PPC must not be\nused as a substitute for civil remedies. (Reliance on 2023 SCMR 1948\nand 2013 SCMR 51).\n\n8. Before parting, it is necessary to acknowledge a worrying pattern\nthat has come up. Increasingly, small groups of lawyers have begun to\ntreat the criminal process as a tool for exerting pressure rather than as a\nmechanism for justice. Lawyers are not only representatives of their\nclients but also officers of the court and servants of the public interest.\nThis dual role requires a careful balance between protecting a client’s\nrights and upholding the integrity of the justice system.

The credibility of the Bar rests not on the force it\ncan apply, but on its adherence to law, ethics, and the confidence the\n\npublic continues to place in it.\n\n9. For what has been discussed above, we convert this petition into\nan appeal, allow it and set aside the impugned order.

JUSTICE MALIK SHAHZAD AHMAD KHAN\n\nCRIMINAL PETITION NO. 868 OF 2025\n(On appeal against the order dated 02.06.2025 of the\nLahore High Court, Lahore in Cr. Misc. No. 22074-B\nof 2025)\n\nAsad Khalil\n... Petitioner\nVersus\n\nThe State and another\n...Respondents\n\nFor the Petitioner: Mr. Abdul Khaliq Safrani, ASC\n\nFor the Complainant: Kh.

Arguments heard. Record perused.\n\n3. The FIR of this case was lodged by Muhammad Ramzan,\nASI, who stated in the FIR that on 08.01.2025 at 05:40 PM he\nreceived an information that two rival groups of the area were firing\n\nat each other in the area of Gilla Ansar Buttwala. On receiving the\n\nCRIMINAL PETITION NO.868 OF 2025 2:\n\nsaid information, he reached at the spot and found that the accused\nnominated in the FIR belonging to two rival groups were firing at\neach other and during the firing, Abdul Jabbar, who belonged to the\nfirst group received a firearm injury on his right knee whereas two\npassersby namely Ahmed aged about 12 years and Usman also\nreceived firearm injuries on their right flank and left wrist,\nrespectively. On seeing the police party, the accused of both the\n\ngroups fled away from the spot, hence, the FIR of this case.\n\n4. The minor Ahmed subsequently died, whereupon,\noffence under Section 302 was added in this case vide zimni No. 1\ndated 09.01.2025. It is, however, admitted by the learned Deputy\nProsecutor General that the above-mentioned Ahmed died on\naccount of firing of the rival group of the petitioner and his legal\nheirs also effected a compromise with the accused of rival group. A\njoint role of cross firing was levelled in the FIR against the\nmembers/accused of both the parties. Although, it was mentioned\nin the contents of the FIR that one person of the first group namely\nAbdul Jabbar was injured during the occurrence as he received a\nfirearm injury on his right knee but it was not mentioned therein\nthat who out of the four nominated accused of the second group\ncaused the said single injury on the right knee of Abdul Jabbar\ninjured. The occurrence in this case took place on 08.01.2025 and\nAbdul Jabbar attributed the injury on his right knee to Asad Khalil,\npetitioner, in his statement recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C. on\n14.02.2025. He made his above-referred statement for the first time\nafter 01 month and 06 days of the occurrence. Although, it is argued\nby the learned DPG that as the above-mentioned Abdul Jabbar was\n\ninjured, therefore, his statement could not be recorded earlier but\n\nCRIMINAL PETITION NO.868 OF 2025 :3:\n\nhe was time and again asked that as to whether any application was\nmoved by the Investigating Officer to the concerned medical officer\nthat as to whether the above-mentioned Abdul Jabbar was fit to\nmake statement or not but he has conceded that no such application\nwas moved before the medical officer by the Investigating Officer of\nthis case. Moreover, the single injury attributed to Asad Khalil,\npetitioner, is on the right knee of Abdul Jabbar injured. The\npetitioner was armed with a firearm but he did not cause any injury\non any vital part of the body of Abdul Jababr injured, who was at\nthe mercy of the petitioner, therefore, attraction of offence under\nSection 324 PPC against the petitioner requires further probe and\n\ninquiry, as observed in the cases of Muhammad Umer Vs The State\n\nand another (PLD 2004 SC 477) and Umer Hayat Vs. The State (2008\n\nSCMR 1621). Insofar as the offence under Section 302 PPC is\nconcerned, as mentioned earlier, the allegation of causing firearm\ninjury on the right flank of Ahmed, deceased, was levelled against\nthe rival group of the petitioner and admittedly there is no allegation\n\nin this respect against the petitioner.\n\n5. Learned DPG has conceded on instructions that the\npetitioner is not involved in any other criminal case. Furthermore, it\nis evident from the perusal of the contents of the FIR that both the\nparties were firing at each other at the time of occurrence and as\nsuch it is a case of cross-versions, therefore, it will be determined by\nthe learned Trial Court after recording of evidence that as to who\nwas the aggressor and who was aggressed upon and as such a case\nfor grant of post-arrest bail is made out in favour of the petitioner as\n\nobserved in the cases of Noor Muhammad Vs.

No.147-K/2025\n(Against order dated 29.5.2025, in Criminal Misc. Application.No.655/2024, passed\nby Single Judge High Court of Sindh, Karachi)\n\nAli Adnan Sheikha\n... Petitioner\n\nVersus\n\n1.G. Police Sindh and others\n... Respondents\n\nFor the Petitioner(s): Mr. Abbad-ul-Hasnain, ASC\nFor the Respondent(s): Mushtaq Abbasi, AIG Legal\n\nLiaquat Ali, SHO, Boat Basin, Karachi,\nWaseem Ahmed, IO\n\nAssisted by: Ms. Zainab Bashir, Judicial Law Clerk,\nSupreme Court of Pakistan.\n\nDate of Hearing: 05.09.2025\nJUDGMENT\n\nAQEEL AHMED ABBASI, J.- The instant Petition for Leave to Appeal\nhas been filed against the order dated 29.5.2025, passed by Single\n\nJudge, High Court of Sindh, Karachi, in Cr. Misc. Application\nNo.655/2024, whereby Cr. Misc. Application, filed against the order\ndated 13.5.2024, passed by Vth Additional Sessions Judge, Karachi\n\n(South) has been dismissed.\n\n2. Briefly, the facts, as stated in the impugned order, passed by the\nSindh High Court, Karachi, are that on 18.11.2005 one Mansoor Ali\nlodged FIR bearing No.410/2005 at Boat Basin Police Station, Karachi,\nfor offences under Sections 506-B, 504, and 34 PPC against petitioner\nand his father (now deceased) in which they were tried and convicted\nby the Trial Court which was set-aside in appeal and they were\nacquitted of the charge by the learned Appellate Court. Per petitioner,\nthe FIR was false and vexatious and during trial the proposed accused\nMuzzamil Ali Sheikha and Mustansar Ali Sheikha (respondents Nos.5\n\n& 6) have recorded false statements against him and his father and\n\nCr.P.L.A. No.147-K/2025 2\n\nbased on their evidence they were convicted but learned Appellate\nCourt has acquitted them in appeal. The petitioner in the first instance\napproached the local police for taking action against the proposed\naccused (respondents Nos.5 & 6) under Section 182, PPC and having\nfailed to receive a response has invoked the jurisdiction under Section\n\n22-A, CrPC.\n\n3. The learned Ex-Officio Justice of Peace after hearing the parties’\nrespective counsel and going through the report of police declined to\nissue direction to the SHO to lodge FIR of the petitioner against the\nrespondents Nos.5 & 6 and dismissed the application under Section\n22-A, CrPC whereafter, the petitioner filed Cr. Misc. Application\nNo.655/2024 before the Sindh High Court, Karachi, which too, vide\nimpugned order, was dismissed and such order has been assailed\n\nthrough the instant Cr. Misc. Application.\n\n4. Learned counsel for the petitioner has vehemently argued that\nboth the Courts below were not justified to decline the relief sought by\nthe petitioner against the accused persons who falsely implicated the\npetitioner in the aforesaid FIR, however, after trial, the petitioner and\nhis father (now deceased) were acquitted from the charge. According to\nlearned counsel, the petitioner and his father were made to face the\ncriminal proceedings, which were based on mala fide and resulted in\nmalicious prosecution, which caused damage and injury to their\nreputation. Learned counsel further argued that it was duty of the\nconcerned Station House Officer (“SHO”) to initiate proceedings under\nSection 182, PPC against respondents Nos.5 & 6 for having recorded\ntheir false statements with an intention to cause injury to the\npetitioner and his father, so that the accused persons would have been\nconvicted under Section 182, PPC for recording false statements. It\nhas been argued that after acquittal of the petitioner and his father in\nthe aforesaid FIR by the Sindh High Court, the petitioner approached\nconcerned police authorities for initiating criminal proceedings against\nthe respondents Nos.5 & 6, however, no action whatsoever was taken\nand thereafter the petitioner was constrained to approach the Ex-\nOfficio Justice of Peace under Section 22-A, CrPC with a request to\nissue direction to the SHO, Boat Basin, Karachi, for initiation of\nproceedings under Section 182, PPC, however, the Justice of Peace,\nwhile discussing the facts and the law has been pleased to observe\n\nthat no harm or injury was caused to the petitioner and his deceased\n\nCr.P.L.A. No.147-K/2025 3\n\nfather in view of the registration of the FIR and the proceedings\nconducted before the two Courts below pursuant to registration of said\nFIR. It has further been argued by the learned counsel that against the\norder passed by the Justice of Peace the petitioner filed Cr. Misc.\nApplication before the High Court of Sindh, Karachi, who, vide\nimpugned order, has been pleased to hold that there is no material\nillegality or infirmity committed by the learned Ex-Officio Justice of\nPeace while passing the order in the instant matter, in spite of the\nfacts that the criminal proceedings initiated by the respondents Nos.5\n& 6 against the petitioner and his father were declared to be illegal by\nthe Vth Addl. Sessions Judge, Karachi (South) in Cr. Appeal\nNo.05/2008, whereby the petitioner and his father were acquitted on\nmerits. Learned counsel has further argued that initially the police\nwas of the view that the allegations leveled by the respondents Nos.5 &\n6 against the petitioner and his father were baseless and without any\nevidence, therefore, Investigation Officer (“I.0”) of the case submitted\nthe final challan for disposal of the FIR in “C” Class, however, the\nconcerned Magistrate did not concur with such report and took\ncognizance of the matter, and resultantly, the petitioner and his father\nfaced the malicious prosecution. In support of his contention, learned\ncounsel has referred to an unreported order dated 07.12.2017, passed\nby this Court in Criminal Petition No.42-K/2017 (Kh. Muhammad\n\nWaseem v. Syed Jalees Anjum, etc.).\n\n5. On the other hand, Mushtaq Abbasi, AIG Legal, Liaquat Ali,\nSHO, Boat Basin, Karachi and Waseem Ahmed, I.O of the FIR, present\nin Court, have supported the impugned order and submitted that in\nview of the proceedings before the judicial forums, wherein, no such\ndirections were issued to the I.O or the SHO for initiation of criminal\nproceedings under Section 182, PPC, therefore, petitioner cannot\ncompel the I.O or the SHO to initiate such proceedings. It is prayed\nthat instant Cr. Petition for Leave to Appeal is liable to be dismissed.\n\n6. Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and the official\nrespondents present in Court, and with their assistance have also\ngone through the record, specifically the impugned order, passed by\nthe Sindh High Court, Karachi. The grievance expressed by the\npetitioner before this Court is against refusal of the concerned SHO to\ninitiate proceedings under Section 182, PPC against two accused\npersons namely Muzzamil Ali Sheikha and Mustansar Ali Sheikha who\n\naccording to the petitioner gave false evidence before the Trial Court\n\nCr.P.L.A. No.147-K/2025 4\n\nresulting in conviction of the petitioner and his father (now deceased)\nin FIR bearing No. 410/2005 at Boat Basin, PS Karachi for offences\nunder Sections 506-B, 504 and 34, PPC vide judgment dated\n03.03.2008 by the court of VIIth Civil Judge and Judicial Magistrate\nKarachi (South). The order of the Trial Court was assailed by the\naccused persons namely Abid Hussain and Ali Adnan Sheikha\n(petitioner in instant case) in Criminal Appeal No. 05/2008 in the\ncourt of VTH Additional District and Session Judge Karachi (South)\nwho vide judgment dated 23.05.2009 set aside the judgment of the\nTrial Court and acquitted the petitioners with further directions to\ncancel the bail bonds and discharge the sureties. It is pertinent to\nmention that petitioner appears to have not assailed the aforesaid\njudgment passed by the Appellant Court as nothing has been placed\non record to this effect. However, the petitioners after a lapse of 15\nyears from the date of aforesaid judgment approached the police\nauthorities to initiate proceedings against the Respondent Nos. 5 & 6\nwho according to petitioner recorded false evidence before the Trial\nCourt. On refusal by the police to exceed to the request of the\npetitioner, the petitioner approached the Ex Officio Justice of Peace i.e.\nVTH Additional District and Session Judge Karachi (South) by filing an\napplication under Section 22-A, CrPC for issuance of direction to the\nconcerned SHO to initiate proceedings under Section 182, PPC against\nthe aforesaid respondents, however, such application was dismissed\nafter hearing the parties in detail vide judgment dated 13.05.2024 in\n\nthe following terms:\n\n“7, Perusal of above section and the case of\napplicant to my view that every action has two\nremedies i.e. Civil and Criminal and the applicant has\navailed the Civil remedy against the PWS (Muzamil\nand Mustansir) and now the applicant has\napproached to this court to issue direction to the SHO\nconcerned for taking action under section 182 PPC\nwherein they (both witnesses) given false statement\nbefore Public servant so also before ILO and also given\nfalse FIR, for which I may say that at the first\ninstance the said statements of PWs were taken into\nconsideration and the applicant and his deceased\nfather were convicted. It is also on record that against\nthe Order of learned Judicial Magistrate whereby he\ntook cognizance against the report submitted by the\nILO under C class has not been challenged at any\nforum, thus once the applicant has admitted the\nstance at the stage of Cognizance. Moreover, the\nCriminal Appeal No.05/2008 nowhere suggests that\never the said plea has been raised or any prayer with\nregard to prosecute the said witnesses under 182 PPC\nwas raised. In view of above discussion I do not find\nthat. any hurt or harm was caused to the applicant\n\nCr.P.L.A. No.147-K/2025 5\n\nand his deceased father in view of the proceedings\nconducted before the two Courts viz. learned Judicial\nMagistrate Karachi and learned VTH Additional\nDistrict and Sessions Judge Karachi South, hence the\nprayer to perform their statutory obligation stand\ndeclined.”\n\n7. The petitioner feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied filed Criminal\nMisc. Application No. 655/2024 under Section 561, CrPC before the\nHigh Court of Sindh, Karachi who after hearing the parties and having\nexamined the entire facts and the relevant law in detail has been\npleased to dismiss the same. It will be advantageous to reproduce the\nreasoning of the learned Single judge of High Court of Sindh, Karachi\nas recorded in para 11 and 12 of the impugned judgment which reads\nas follows:\n\n“11. Under the scheme of law a person who lays\ninformation to police is entitled to have his case\njudicially determined before he is called upon to\nanswer the charge of giving false information. Had\nthere been a false FIR, there was no need to submit\nreport under \"C\" Class by the Investigating Officer. In\nthis backdrop, issuance of direction for initiation of\nproceedings under Section 182, P.P.C against the\ncomplainant or his witnesses would amount to abuse\nof process of law more particularly when applicant\nhas approached the Ex-Officio Justice of Peace after\nlapse of about 15 years of his acquittal by the learned\nAppellate Court. Even otherwise, the proceedings\nunder Section 182 Cr.P.C. can only be initiated by a\ncivil servant and no one can interfere and even a\njudicial direction for initiation of such proceedings\ncannot be issued just because of the bar imposed by\nSection 195, Cr.P.C, which provides that in all\noffences punishable under Sections 172 to 188, PPC,\nno Court call take cognizance except on a written\ncomplaint of the concerned public servant or some\nother public servant to whom he is subordinate. I am,\nthus, of the view that issuance of a direction to the\nSHO for initiation of criminal proceedings under\nSection 182 PPC, would be contrary to statutory\nprovision of Section 195, Cr.P.C.\n\n12. Considering the factual and legal position, as\ndiscussed above, I am of the view that the refusal by\nthe learned Ex-Officio Justice of Peace to issue\ndirection to the Station House Officer for registration of\nFIR does not suffer from any jurisdictional error or\nflaw. The impugned order, on the face of it, is just,\nproper and speaking one. The learned counsel for the\napplicant has failed to point out any material illegality\nor serious infirmity committed by the learned Ex-\nOfficio Justice of Peace while passing the impugned\norder, which in my humble view is based on fair\nevaluation of record, hence calls for no interference by\nthis Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section\n561-A, Cr.P.C.. In view thereof, this Criminal Misc.\nApplication No.232 of 2025 is bereft of any merit\nstands dismissed.”\n\nCr.P.L.A. No.147-K/2025 6\n\n8. Though the learned Single Judge in the aforesaid paras has\ncorrectly interpreted the relevant provisions of law which do not\nrequire any interference by this Court however, in order to further\nelaborate the scope of the relevant provisions of law attracted in\ninstant case i.e. Sections 173, 190 and 195, CrPC and Section 182,\nPPC we may examine the same in detail. It will be advantageous to\n\nreproduce the aforesaid sections which reads as follows:\n\n“173. Report of _ police-officer. (1) Every\ninvestigation under this Chapter shall be completed\nwithout unnecessary delay, and as soon as it is\ncompleted, the officer incharge of the police station\nshall, [through the Public Prosecutor].\n\n(a) forward to a Magistrate empowered to take\ncognizance of the offence on a police-report a report in\nthe form prescribed by the Provincial Government,\nsetting forth the names of the parties, the nature of the\ninformation and the names of the persons who appear\nto be acquainted with the circumstances of the case,\nand stating whether the accused (if arrested) has\nbeen forwarded in custody or has been released on\nhis bond, and, if so, whether with or without sureties,\nand”\n\n“190.

False information with intent to cause\npublic servant to use his lawful power to the\ninjury of another person:\n\nCr.P.L.A. No.147-K/2025 7\n\nWhoever gives to any public servant any information\nwhich he knows or believes to be false, intending\nthereby to cause, or knowing it to be likely that he will\nthereby cause, such public servant:-\n\n(a) to do or omit anything which such public\nservant ought not to do or omit if the true state of facts\nrespecting which such information is given were\nknown by him, or\n\n(b) to use the lawful power of such public servant\nto the injury or annoyance of any person,\n\nshall be punished with imprisonment of either\ndescription for a term which may extend to six\nmonths, or with fine which may extend to [three\nthousand rupees], or with both.\n\n9. Section 173, CrPC mandates that every investigation pursuant\nto FIR shall be completed within 14 days however, if the investigation\nis not completed within a period of 14 days, the officer In Charge of the\npolice station shall within 3 days of the expiration of such period\nforward to the Magistrate through the public prosecutor, an interim\nreport in the form prescribed by the provincial government. I.O after\ncompleting investigation as per Rule 24.7 of the Police Rules, 1934 can\nrecommend disposal of an FIR in Class “A” if the case is true but\naccused is untraceable, or in Class “B” if the information given to the\npolice is maliciously false, or in Class “C”, if matter is non-cognizable\nor for a civil suit or the case was filed owing to mistake of fact.\nReliance in this regard can be placed on the case of Syed Qamber Ali\n\nShah _vs. Province of Sindh and others (2024 SCMR 1123). Once such\n\nreport is submitted before the concerned Magistrate of First Class or\nany other Magistrate specially empowered by the provincial\ngovernment on the recommendation of High Court, such Magistrate\nhas the power to either accept the same or take cognizance of the\noffence reported or to direct the I.O to reinvestigate the matter and\nsubmit a fresh report within the prescribed period. However, the\nMagistrate has no authority to direct the I.O for disposal of the FIR\nunder A, B or C class as referred to herein above. In case the I.O after\ncompletion of the investigation forms an opinion that the information\nlaid before the police by the complainant is false, he can recommend\nthe disposal of the FIR in “B” Class (maliciously false) after recording\nreasons and submit the same before the concerned Magistrate, who\nafter perusal of the same can accept such recommendation and\ndispose of the FIR in “B” class or issue directions for disposal of the\ncase in any other class and can take cognizance of the matter and\nproceed further in accordance with law. However, said Magistrate has\nno authority to issue directions to initiate proceedings under Section\n\n182, PPC against the complainant in view of the bar laid under Section\n\nCr.P.L.A. No.147-K/2025 8\n\n195, CrPC which provides that no Court shall take cognizance of any\n\noffence punishable under Sections 172 to_ 187 of the Pakistan Penal\n\nCode, except on the complaint in writing of the public servant concerned,\n\nor of some other public servant to whom he is subordinate;” It may be\n\nclarified that in case of registration of an FIR the information is laid\nbefore the SHO of the concerned police station, then only the said SHO\nis competent to initiate proceedings under Section 182, PPC in case of\nfalse information in appropriate cases, whereas, if such SHO is not\navailable or prevented by sufficient cause to initiate proceedings under\nSection 182, PPC then such proceedings can be initiated by a superior\n\npolice officer.\n\n10. Having examined the aforesaid provisions of law we may now\nexplain the scope of Section 182, PPC which provides that if a\ncomplaint is laid before any public servant giving any information\nwhich he/she knows or believes to be false with an intention to cause\nor likely to cause, such public servant, to do or omit anything which\nsuch public servant ought not to do or omit if the true state of facts\nwere known by him, or to use the lawful power of such public servant\nto the injury or annoyance of such person then such person shall be\npunished with imprisonment of either description for a term which\nmay extend to six months or with fine too which may extend to three\nthousand rupees or with both. It may be observed here that incase the\ninformation laid before the public servant with Bonafide belief and\nknowledge of it being true, the same cannot be termed as false unless\nit is proved in accordance with law through judicial proceedings. Such\ninformation can be termed as ‘not proved’ and not ‘alse’ and,\ntherefore, the same cannot attract the penal provision of Section 182,\nPPC. Suffice is to state that provision of Section 182, PPC can only be\ninitiated by the public servant before whom the false information was\nlaid, which resulted in initiation of criminal proceedings and found to\nbe false through judicial process, whereas, such penal provisions\ncannot be invoked in cases where the complainant could not prove the\nallegations by producing sufficient evidence or material in support of\n\nsuch allegation before the judicial forum.\n\n11. To sum up the above discussion in view of hereinabove\nprovisions of law it has emerged that no court can take cognizance of\nany offence punishable under Section 182, PPC for having given false\n\ninformation to a public servant in order to cause him to use his lawful\n\nCr.P.L.A. No.147-K/2025 9\n\npower, except on a written complaint of the concerned public servant\nor his higher authority. Reliance in this regard can be placed on the\njudgment of this Court in the case of Abdur Rahman vs. The State\n(1968 P Cr. L J 215). Further reference can also be placed on the\n\nSupreme Court judgments of the Indian jurisdiction in the case of\nSaloni Arora Vs. State of NCT of Delhi (AIR 2017 SC 391), and also in\nthe case of Daulat_Ram_vs. State of Punjab (1962 AIR 28). The\n\ncognizance by a Magistrate could have been taken in the given case on\na written complaint of the concerned police officer, whereas, the\nMagistrate or Ex-Officio Justice of Peace had no locus standi or the\nauthority to order or issue directions for filing of a complaint in respect\n\nof an offence under Section 182, PPC.\n\n12. In the case in hand it has transpired that neither the I.O formed\nan opinion that the information given by the complainant is false nor\nsubmitted the report under Section 173, CrPC before the concerned\nMagistrate for disposal of the case in “B” Class, instead the report was\nsubmitted for disposal of the case in “C” Class however, the Magistrate\ntook cognizance of the matter and convicted the accused persons\nnominated therein through judicial process. Such judgment of the\nTrial Court was assailed before the appellate forum who acquitted the\naccused persons in view of the contradiction in the judgment of the\nTrial Court. However, there was no finding of the Appellate Court to\nthe effect that the information laid before the police by the\ncomplainant was false. Since there was no opinion of the I.O and\nfinding by any judicial forum holding the information laid before the\npolice by the complainant as false, therefore, the provisions of Section\n182, PPC are otherwise not attracted in the instant case. Any other\ninterpretation to hereinabove provisions of law would result in\nmultiplying the criminal litigation out of same criminal proceedings\nand would open a floodgate of filing frivolous proceedings in every\ncriminal case where the complainant could not succeed due to any\nother reason i.e. jurisdictional defect, limitation, insufficient evidence,\n\nor benefit of doubt etc.\n\n13. In view of hereinabove facts and circumstances of the case, we\ndo not find any substance in the instant Criminal Petition for Leave to\nAppeal whereas, the learned Single Judge of Sindh High Court,\nKarachi has ably dealt with all the factual and legal issues as per spirit\n\nof law, therefore, the impugned judgment does not suffer from any\n\nCr.P.L.A. No.147-K/2025 10\n\nfactual error or legal infirmity. Accordingly, above Criminal Petition for\n\nLeave to Appeal was dismissed vide our short order in the following\nterms:\n\n“Heard learned counsel for petitioner. For reasons to\nfollow, the petition is dismissed by imposing costs of\n\nRs.25,000/- upon the petitioner.”\n\n14.

            "CleanedText": "JUDGMENT AQEEL AHMED ABBASI, J.- The instant Petition for Leave to Appeal has been filed against the order dated 29.5.2025, passed by Single Judge, High Court of Sindh, Karachi, in Cr. Misc. Application No.655/2024, whereby Cr. Misc. Application, filed against the order dated 13.5.2024, passed by Vth Additional Sessions Judge, Karachi South has been dismissed. 2. Briefly, the facts, as stated in the impugned order, passed by the Sindh High Court, Karachi, are that on 18.11.2005 one Mansoor Ali lodged FIR bearing No.410/2005 at Boat Basin Police Station, Karachi, for offences under Sections 506-B, 504, and 34 PPC against petitioner and his father now deceased in which they were tried and convicted by the Trial Court which was set-aside in appeal and they were acquitted of the charge by the learned Appellate Court. Per petitioner, the FIR was false and vexatious and during trial the proposed accused Muzzamil Ali Sheikha and Mustansar Ali Sheikha respondents Nos.5 6 have recorded false statements against him and his father and Cr.P.L.A. No.147-K/2025 2 based on their evidence they were convicted but learned Appellate Court has acquitted them in appeal. The petitioner in the first instance approached the local police for taking action against the proposed accused respondents Nos.5 6 under Section 182, PPC and having failed to receive a response has invoked the jurisdiction under Section 22-A, CrPC. 3. The learned Ex-Officio Justice of Peace after hearing the parties respective counsel and going through the report of police declined to issue direction to the SHO to lodge FIR of the petitioner against the respondents Nos.5 6 and dismissed the application under Section 22-A, CrPC whereafter, the petitioner filed Cr. Misc. Application No.655/2024 before the Sindh High Court, Karachi, which too, vide impugned order, was dismissed and such order has been assailed through the instant Cr. Misc. Application. 4. Learned counsel for the petitioner has vehemently argued that both the Courts below were not justified to decline the relief sought by the petitioner against the accused persons who falsely implicated the petitioner in the aforesaid FIR, however, after trial, the petitioner and his father now deceased were acquitted from the charge. According to learned counsel, the petitioner and his father were made to face the criminal proceedings, which were based on mala fide and resulted in malicious prosecution, which caused damage and injury to their reputation. Learned counsel further argued that it was duty of the concerned Station House Officer SHO to initiate proceedings under Section 182, PPC against respondents Nos.5 6 for having recorded their false statements with an intention to cause injury to the petitioner and his father, so that the accused persons would have been convicted under Section 182, PPC for recording false statements. It has been argued that after acquittal of the petitioner and his father in the aforesaid FIR by the Sindh High Court, the petitioner approached concerned police authorities for initiating criminal proceedings against the respondents Nos.5 6, however, no action whatsoever was taken and thereafter the petitioner was constrained to approach the ExOfficio Justice of Peace under Section 22-A, CrPC with a request to issue direction to the SHO, Boat Basin, Karachi, for initiation of proceedings under Section 182, PPC, however, the Justice of Peace, while discussing the facts and the law has been pleased to observe that no harm or injury was caused to the petitioner and his deceased Cr.P.L.A. No.147-K/2025 3 father in view of the registration of the FIR and the proceedings conducted before the two Courts below pursuant to registration of said FIR. It has further been argued by the learned counsel that against the order passed by the Justice of Peace the petitioner filed Cr. Misc. Application before the High Court of Sindh, Karachi, who, vide impugned order, has been pleased to hold that there is no material illegality or infirmity committed by the learned Ex-Officio Justice of Peace while passing the order in the instant matter, in spite of the facts that the criminal proceedings initiated by the respondents Nos.5 6 against the petitioner and his father were declared to be illegal by the Vth Addl. Sessions Judge, Karachi South in Cr. Appeal No.05/2008, whereby the petitioner and his father were acquitted on merits. Learned counsel has further argued that initially the police was of the view that the allegations leveled by the respondents Nos.5 6 against the petitioner and his father were baseless and without any evidence, therefore, Investigation Officer I.0 of the case submitted the final challan for disposal of the FIR in C Class, however, the concerned Magistrate did not concur with such report and took cognizance of the matter, and resultantly, the petitioner and his father faced the malicious prosecution. In support of his contention, learned counsel has referred to an unreported order dated 07.12.2017, passed by this Court in Criminal Petition No.42-K/2017 Kh. Muhammad Waseem v. Syed Jalees Anjum, etc. . 5. On the other hand, Mushtaq Abbasi, AIG Legal, Liaquat Ali, SHO, Boat Basin, Karachi and Waseem Ahmed, I.O of the FIR, present in Court, have supported the impugned order and submitted that in view of the proceedings before the judicial forums, wherein, no such directions were issued to the I.O or the SHO for initiation of criminal proceedings under Section 182, PPC, therefore, petitioner cannot compel the I.O or the SHO to initiate such proceedings. It is prayed that instant Cr. Petition for Leave to Appeal is liable to be dismissed. 6. Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and the official respondents present in Court, and with their assistance have also gone through the record, specifically the impugned order, passed by the Sindh High Court, Karachi. The grievance expressed by the petitioner before this Court is against refusal of the concerned SHO to initiate proceedings under Section 182, PPC against two accused persons namely Muzzamil Ali Sheikha and Mustansar Ali Sheikha who according to the petitioner gave false evidence before the Trial Court Cr.P.L.A. No.147-K/2025 4 resulting in conviction of the petitioner and his father now deceased in FIR bearing No. 410/2005 at Boat Basin, PS Karachi for offences under Sections 506-B, 504 and 34, PPC vide judgment dated 03.03.2008 by the court of VIIth Civil Judge and Judicial Magistrate Karachi South . The order of the Trial Court was assailed by the accused persons namely Abid Hussain and Ali Adnan Sheikha petitioner in instant case in Criminal Appeal No. 05/2008 in the court of VTH Additional District and Session Judge Karachi South who vide judgment dated 23.05.2009 set aside the judgment of the Trial Court and acquitted the petitioners with further directions to cancel the bail bonds and discharge the sureties. It is pertinent to mention that petitioner appears to have not assailed the aforesaid judgment passed by the Appellant Court as nothing has been placed on record to this effect. However, the petitioners after a lapse of 15 years from the date of aforesaid judgment approached the police authorities to initiate proceedings against the Respondent Nos. 5 6 who according to petitioner recorded false evidence before the Trial Court. On refusal by the police to exceed to the request of the petitioner, the petitioner approached the Ex Officio Justice of Peace i.e. VTH Additional District and Session Judge Karachi South by filing an application under Section 22-A, CrPC for issuance of direction to the concerned SHO to initiate proceedings under Section 182, PPC against the aforesaid respondents, however, such application was dismissed after hearing the parties in detail vide judgment dated 13.05.2024 in the following terms: 7, Perusal of above section and the case of applicant to my view that every action has two remedies i.e. Civil and Criminal and the applicant has availed the Civil remedy against the PWS Muzamil and Mustansir and now the applicant has approached to this court to issue direction to the SHO concerned for taking action under section 182 PPC wherein they both witnesses given false statement before Public servant so also before ILO and also given false FIR, for which I may say that at the first instance the said statements of PWs were taken into consideration and the applicant and his deceased father were convicted. It is also on record that against the Order of learned Judicial Magistrate whereby he took cognizance against the report submitted by the ILO under C class has not been challenged at any forum, thus once the applicant has admitted the stance at the stage of Cognizance. Moreover, the Criminal Appeal No.05/2008 nowhere suggests that ever the said plea has been raised or any prayer with regard to prosecute the said witnesses under 182 PPC was raised. In view of above discussion I do not find that. any hurt or harm was caused to the applicant Cr.P.L.A. No.147-K/2025 5 and his deceased father in view of the proceedings conducted before the two Courts viz. learned Judicial Magistrate Karachi and learned VTH Additional District and Sessions Judge Karachi South, hence the prayer to perform their statutory obligation stand declined. 7. The petitioner feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied filed Criminal Misc. Application No. 655/2024 under Section 561, CrPC before the High Court of Sindh, Karachi who after hearing the parties and having examined the entire facts and the relevant law in detail has been pleased to dismiss the same. It will be advantageous to reproduce the reasoning of the learned Single judge of High Court of Sindh, Karachi as recorded in para 11 and 12 of the impugned judgment which reads as follows: 11. Under the scheme of law a person who lays information to police is entitled to have his case judicially determined before he is called upon to answer the charge of giving false information. Had there been a false FIR, there was no need to submit report under C Class by the Investigating Officer. In this backdrop, issuance of direction for initiation of proceedings under Section 182, P.P.C against the complainant or his witnesses would amount to abuse of process of law more particularly when applicant has approached the Ex-Officio Justice of Peace after lapse of about 15 years of his acquittal by the learned Appellate Court. Even otherwise, the proceedings under Section 182 Cr.P.C. can only be initiated by a civil servant and no one can interfere and even a judicial direction for initiation of such proceedings cannot be issued just because of the bar imposed by Section 195, Cr.P.C, which provides that in all offences punishable under Sections 172 to 188, PPC, no Court call take cognizance except on a written complaint of the concerned public servant or some other public servant to whom he is subordinate. I am, thus, of the view that issuance of a direction to the SHO for initiation of criminal proceedings under Section 182 PPC, would be contrary to statutory provision of Section 195, Cr.P.C. 12. Considering the factual and legal position, as discussed above, I am of the view that the refusal by the learned Ex-Officio Justice of Peace to issue direction to the Station House Officer for registration of FIR does not suffer from any jurisdictional error or flaw. The impugned order, on the face of it, is just, proper and speaking one. The learned counsel for the applicant has failed to point out any material illegality or serious infirmity committed by the learned ExOfficio Justice of Peace while passing the impugned order, which in my humble view is based on fair evaluation of record, hence calls for no interference by this Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 561-A, Cr.P.C.. In view thereof, this Criminal Misc. Application No.232 of 2025 is bereft of any merit stands dismissed. Cr.P.L.A. No.147-K/2025 6 8. Though the learned Single Judge in the aforesaid paras has correctly interpreted the relevant provisions of law which do not require any interference by this Court however, in order to further elaborate the scope of the relevant provisions of law attracted in instant case i.e. Sections 173, 190 and 195, CrPC and Section 182, PPC we may examine the same in detail. It will be advantageous to reproduce the aforesaid sections which reads as follows: 173. Report of police-officer. 1 Every investigation under this Chapter shall be completed without unnecessary delay, and as soon as it is completed, the officer incharge of the police station shall, through the Public Prosecutor . a forward to a Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of the offence on a police-report a report in the form prescribed by the Provincial Government, setting forth the names of the parties, the nature of the information and the names of the persons who appear to be acquainted with the circumstances of the case, and stating whether the accused if arrested has been forwarded in custody or has been released on his bond, and, if so, whether with or without sureties, and 190. Cognizance of offences by Magistrates. 1 All Magistrates of the first class or any other Magistrate specially empowered by the Provincial Government on the recommendation of High Court may take cognizance of any offence: a upon receiving a complaint of facts which constitute such offence; b upon a report in writing of such facts made by any police-officer; c upon information received from any person other than a police-officer, or upon his knowledge or suspicion; that such offence has been committed which he may try or send to the Court of Sessions for trial. 2 A Magistrate taking cognizance under sub-section 1 of an offence triable exclusively by a Court of Session shall, without recording any evidence send the case to the Court of Session for trial. ..195. Prosecution for contempt of lawful authority of public servants. Prosecution for certain offence against public justice. Prosecution for certain offences relating to documents given in evidence. 1 No Court shall take cognizance: -- a of any offence punishable under Sections 172 to 187 of the Pakistan Penal Code, except on the complaint in writing of the public servant concerned, or of some other public servant to whom he is subordinate;... 182. False information with intent to cause public servant to use his lawful power to the injury of another person: Cr.P.L.A. No.147-K/2025 7 Whoever gives to any public servant any information which he knows or believes to be false, intending thereby to cause, or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby cause, such public servant:- a to do or omit anything which such public servant ought not to do or omit if the true state of facts respecting which such information is given were known by him, or b to use the lawful power of such public servant to the injury or annoyance of any person, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to three thousand rupees , or with both. 9. Section 173, CrPC mandates that every investigation pursuant to FIR shall be completed within 14 days however, if the investigation is not completed within a period of 14 days, the officer In Charge of the police station shall within 3 days of the expiration of such period forward to the Magistrate through the public prosecutor, an interim report in the form prescribed by the provincial government. I.O after completing investigation as per Rule 24.7 of the Police Rules, 1934 can recommend disposal of an FIR in Class A if the case is true but accused is untraceable, or in Class B if the information given to the police is maliciously false, or in Class C , if matter is non-cognizable or for a civil suit or the case was filed owing to mistake of fact. Reliance in this regard can be placed on the case of Syed Qamber Ali Shah vs. Province of Sindh and others 2024 SCMR 1123 . Once such report is submitted before the concerned Magistrate of First Class or any other Magistrate specially empowered by the provincial government on the recommendation of High Court, such Magistrate has the power to either accept the same or take cognizance of the offence reported or to direct the I.O to reinvestigate the matter and submit a fresh report within the prescribed period. However, the Magistrate has no authority to direct the I.O for disposal of the FIR under A, B or C class as referred to herein above. In case the I.O after completion of the investigation forms an opinion that the information laid before the police by the complainant is false, he can recommend the disposal of the FIR in B Class maliciously false after recording reasons and submit the same before the concerned Magistrate, who after perusal of the same can accept such recommendation and dispose of the FIR in B class or issue directions for disposal of the case in any other class and can take cognizance of the matter and proceed further in accordance with law. However, said Magistrate has no authority to issue directions to initiate proceedings under Section 182, PPC against the complainant in view of the bar laid under Section Cr.P.L.A. No.147-K/2025 8 195, CrPC which provides that no Court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under Sections 172 to 187 of the Pakistan Penal Code, except on the complaint in writing of the public servant concerned, or of some other public servant to whom he is subordinate; It may be clarified that in case of registration of an FIR the information is laid before the SHO of the concerned police station, then only the said SHO is competent to initiate proceedings under Section 182, PPC in case of false information in appropriate cases, whereas, if such SHO is not available or prevented by sufficient cause to initiate proceedings under Section 182, PPC then such proceedings can be initiated by a superior police officer. 10. Having examined the aforesaid provisions of law we may now explain the scope of Section 182, PPC which provides that if a complaint is laid before any public servant giving any information which he/she knows or believes to be false with an intention to cause or likely to cause, such public servant, to do or omit anything which such public servant ought not to do or omit if the true state of facts were known by him, or to use the lawful power of such public servant to the injury or annoyance of such person then such person shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to six months or with fine too which may extend to three thousand rupees or with both. It may be observed here that incase the information laid before the public servant with Bonafide belief and knowledge of it being true, the same cannot be termed as false unless it is proved in accordance with law through judicial proceedings. Such information can be termed as not proved and not alse and, therefore, the same cannot attract the penal provision of Section 182, PPC. Suffice is to state that provision of Section 182, PPC can only be initiated by the public servant before whom the false information was laid, which resulted in initiation of criminal proceedings and found to be false through judicial process, whereas, such penal provisions cannot be invoked in cases where the complainant could not prove the allegations by producing sufficient evidence or material in support of such allegation before the judicial forum. 11. To sum up the above discussion in view of hereinabove provisions of law it has emerged that no court can take cognizance of any offence punishable under Section 182, PPC for having given false information to a public servant in order to cause him to use his lawful Cr.P.L.A. No.147-K/2025 9 power, except on a written complaint of the concerned public servant or his higher authority. Reliance in this regard can be placed on the judgment of this Court in the case of Abdur Rahman vs. The State 1968 P Cr. L J 215 . Further reference can also be placed on the Supreme Court judgments of the Indian jurisdiction in the case of Saloni Arora Vs. State of NCT of Delhi AIR 2017 SC 391 , and also in the case of Daulat Ram vs. State of Punjab 1962 AIR 28 . The cognizance by a Magistrate could have been taken in the given case on a written complaint of the concerned police officer, whereas, the Magistrate or Ex-Officio Justice of Peace had no locus standi or the authority to order or issue directions for filing of a complaint in respect of an offence under Section 182, PPC. 12. In the case in hand it has transpired that neither the I.O formed an opinion that the information given by the complainant is false nor submitted the report under Section 173, CrPC before the concerned Magistrate for disposal of the case in B Class, instead the report was submitted for disposal of the case in C Class however, the Magistrate took cognizance of the matter and convicted the accused persons nominated therein through judicial process. Such judgment of the Trial Court was assailed before the appellate forum who acquitted the accused persons in view of the contradiction in the judgment of the Trial Court. However, there was no finding of the Appellate Court to the effect that the information laid before the police by the complainant was false. Since there was no opinion of the I.O and finding by any judicial forum holding the information laid before the police by the complainant as false, therefore, the provisions of Section 182, PPC are otherwise not attracted in the instant case. Any other interpretation to hereinabove provisions of law would result in multiplying the criminal litigation out of same criminal proceedings and would open a floodgate of filing frivolous proceedings in every criminal case where the complainant could not succeed due to any other reason i.e. jurisdictional defect, limitation, insufficient evidence, or benefit of doubt etc. 13. In view of hereinabove facts and circumstances of the case, we do not find any substance in the instant Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal whereas, the learned Single Judge of Sindh High Court, Karachi has ably dealt with all the factual and legal issues as per spirit of law, therefore, the impugned judgment does not suffer from any Cr.P.L.A. No.147-K/2025 10 factual error or legal infirmity. Accordingly, above Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal was dismissed vide our short order in the following terms: Heard learned counsel for petitioner. For reasons to follow, the petition is dismissed by imposing costs of Rs.25,000/- upon the petitioner. 14. Above are the reasons for such short order.

So far\n\nas Ali Raza (petitioner No.3), is concerned, we have noted that in the\nmedico legal report of Sufiyan PW, the Medical Officer has mentioned\nthe injury on his head as skin deep. Section 337A(ii) PPC, is attracted\nwhen bone under the injury is exposed but it is evident from the perusal\nof medico legal report of Sufiyan PW that no such finding regarding\nexposing the bone of the head of Sufiyan PW was mentioned in the\nreport rather it was categorically mentioned that injury on the head of\nSufiyan PW was skin deep, hence offence under section 337A(i) PPC,\nwhich is a bailable offence, is attracted instead of section 337A(ii) PPC,\nto the extent of the abovementioned injury entitling Ali Raza (petitioner\nNo.3), to the grant of pre-arrest bail. Reference in this context may be\n\nmade to the judgment reported as “Muhammad Qasim and another v.\n\nThe State and others” (PLD 2014 Lahore 555).\n\n4. We have also noted that sixteen (16) named and 4/5 unknown\naccused persons total 20/21 accused persons have been implicated in\n\nthis case by the complainant, therefore, possibility of malafide\n\nCriminal Petition No.585 of 2025 3\n\ninvolvement of the petitioners in this case by the complainant while\nusing the wider-net cannot be ruled out at this stage.\n\n5.

Briefly stated, the facts of the case are that the petitioners claim\nthat their late father, Dr. Muhammad Bashir Qasim (hereinafter referred\nto as the \"deceased\"), was the lawful owner of property bearing Plot No.\n64-1/B, Block-6, PECHS, Survey Sheet No. 35-P/1, measuring 416.47\nsquare yards, comprising a ground floor plus two additional stories. The\npetitioners admit that they were tenants of Mst. Farida Bano (hereinafter\nreferred to as \"MFB\"), the previous owner of the said property, from 1979,\nand were running a school under the name Greenfield Secondary School.\nHowever, in the year 1987-88, the deceased allegedly purchased the\n\nproperty from MFB through a sale agreement dated 10.11.1987, upon\n\nwhich an advance payment of Rs.50,000/- was made. The petitioners\n\nCP 1032-K OF 2025,\n2\n\nfurther claim that the entire sale consideration was subsequently paid\neither through pay orders or direct deposits into MFB's bank account.\nThey assert that, since 1987-88, they have remained in uninterrupted\npossession of the premises as its absolute owners. It is also claimed that\nMFB issued no-objection certificates (NOCs) required for various\ngovernment departments, and that the petitioners had paid all the utility\nbills prior to the purported sale. It is further claimed that, after\npurchasing the property, the petitioners constructed two additional floors\nthereon; however, despite payment of the entire sale consideration, MFB\n\ndid not transfer the property in their name.\n\n3. It was also the claim of the petitioners that MFB executed a Power\nof Attorney in favour of one Muhammad Aslam (hereinafter referred to as\n\"MA\") on 13.11.1989, authorising him to effect transfer of the property\nin their favour. However, as no transfer ensued, the deceased instituted\nSuit No. 702/1989 for specific performance against MFB and MA before\nthe High Court of Sindh. Vide interim order dated 09.06.1989, later\nconfirmed on 17.12.1989, the High Court restrained MFB and MA from\nalienating, selling, or otherwise disposing of the subject property.\nSubsequently, on an application moved by MA dated 14.10.1991, the\nHigh Court modified its earlier restraining order, dated 17.12.1989, to\nthe extent that MA was permitted to mortgage the property for the\npurpose of repaying a loan to Muslim Commercial Bank (MCB).\nThereafter, MA instituted a counter-suit, i.e., Suit No. 373/1999, against\nthe petitioners as well as MFB, for recovery and injunction. Both suits\nwere clubbed together and transferred from the High Court to the Court\nof the Senior Civil Judge due to enhancement in pecuniary jurisdiction,\nand renumbered as Suit No. 1579/1996 (old No. 702/1989) and Suit No.\n1526/1996 (old No. 373/ 1999), respectively. It is an admitted fact that\n\nboth suits remain pending adjudication.\n\nCP 1032-K OF 2025\n3\n\n4. The present respondent, Gulzar Mehmood (hereinafter referred to\nas \"GM\"), claiming to have purchased the property from MA through a\nregistered sale deed dated 21.07.2001, filed a rent case under Section 15\nof the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979 (hereinafter referred to as\n\"SRPO\"), along with an application under Section 16(1) of the SRPO,\nbearing R.C. No. 153/2003, against the deceased. GM asserted that he\nhad lawfully purchased the property from MFB through her attorney MA,\nand that by operation of law, the petitioners became his tenants, liable\nto pay rent with effect from 2001. After examining the record and\nevidence produced, the learned V Rent Controller, Karachi South, found\nthat the applicant/GM (respondent before this Court), having acquired\nownership through a registered sale deed dated 21.07.2001, was entitled\nto receive rent from the deceased (whose legal heirs are the present\npetitioners), who stood in a tenant-landlord relationship with him.\nConsequently, vide order dated 08.03.2008, the Rent Controller directed\nthe petitioners to deposit arrears of rent from 21.07.2001 to March 2008\nat the rate of Rs.25,000/- per month within one month, and to continue\npaying future monthly rent at the same rate (subject to a 10% annual\n\nincrease) by the 10th of each month.\n\n5. GM also filed an application under Section 16(2) of the SRPO for\nnon-compliance with the tentative rent order dated 08.03.2008. This\napplication was. allowed by the Rent Controller vide order dated\n29.01.2018, whereby the defence of the petitioners was struck off and\nthey were directed to vacate and hand over peaceful possession of the\npremises within 30 days of the passing of the order. Aggrieved by the said\norder, the deceased filed First Rent Appeal (FRA) No, 85/2018 before the\nlearned District Judge, Karachi South, who, vide judgment dated\n\n14.11.2018, affirmed the Rent Controller's order and directed the\n\npetitioners to vacate the premises within 30 days from the announcement\n\n4\nof the judgment. The petitioners then approached the High Court through\nConstitution Petition No. S-2602/2018, which too was decided against\nthe petitioners by categorially observing that since the petitioners have\nfailed to comply with the order dated 08.03.2008 passed under Section\n16(1) of the SRPO, which was tentative in nature, the default in the case\nhas been established and therefore the two Courts below were justified\nin striking off the defence of the present petitioners under Section 16(2)\nof the SRPO and rightly directed the petitioners to vacate the premises in\nquestion. The High Court further observed that since some civil dispute\nis pending between the parties, with regard to the ownership of the\nproperty that may be considered by the appropriate Court of law in\naccordance with the law. It is against this judgment that the instant civil\n\npetition for leave to appeal has been filed.\n\n6. Raja Qasit Nawaz Khan, ASC has appeared on behalf of the\npetitioners and stated that all the three Courts below have erred in\ndeciding the matter against the petitioners, without properly appreciating\nthe fact that the petitioners, though initially from 1979 to 1987, were the\ntenants of MFB but had become owners of the said property by virtue of\na sale agreement dated 10.11.1987 when they purchased the said\nproperty from MFB, who fraudulently had not transferred the same in\ntheir names. According to him, there was no possibility of the petitioners\nbeing treated as tenants in respect of the said property or being required\nto pay any rent either to MFB or to GM. The learned counsel stated that\nthe averments of the respondent GM that he was the landlord of the\nproperty are totally incorrect as the petitioners had already purchased\nthe property from MFB way back in 1987, whereas the claim of GM that\nhe has purchased the property in 2001 from MA, attorney of MFB, is\n\nuncalled for. According to him, the petitioners only came to know about\n\nGM allegedly purchasing the property from MFB through her attorney\n\nCP 1032-K OF 2025\n5\n\nMA when the rent case was filed by GM before the Rent Controller,\nagainst them. He stated that the present matter is a result of connivance\n\namong MFB, her attorney MA and GM with the sole intention to\n\ndispossess the present petitioners from the property.\n\nte The learned counsel stated that the Rent Controller as well as the\nAppellate Court have illegally fixed the rent at the rate of Rs.25000/- per\nmonth and directed the petitioners to pay the same from 2001, which\naction is wholly illegal, unjustified, and without lawful authority, and\nhave illegally struck off the defence of the petitioners and passed the\nimpugned ejectment orders for the alleged non-compliance of the\ntentative rent order passed under section 16(1) of the SRPO’79. He\nstressed that MFB, MA and GM have miserably failed to establish their\nownership over the property. He stated that the NOC issued by MFB to\nthe petitioners was an ample proof that the petitioners acquired the\nownership rights. He submitted that production of sale agreement\ncoupled with evidences of payment of sale consideration would prove the\nbona fides of the petitioners in acquiring the said property, which was\nnot considered by the three fora below. According to him, since the\npetitioners were owners of the property; therefore, there was no question\nof paying any rent or being treated as a defaulter in respect of any alleged\nrent or arrears thereof. He, therefore, stated that the present petitioners\nvehemently deny the existence of relationship of landlord and tenant\nbetween the parties and prayed that the orders passed by the three\n\nCourts below, being illegal and uncalled for, may be set aside.\n\n8. We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioners, gone\nthrough the impugned judgment and the law on the subject and have\nalso examined the available record minutely.\n\n9. At the very outset, we would like to state that the issue with regard\n\nto ownership, still pending adjudication, cannot be taken up or dilated -\n\nCP 1032-K OF 2025\n6\n\nupon. Reference in this regard may be made to the decision given in the\ncase of Umar Gul versus Dr. Hafiza Akhtar and others (2025 SCMR\n\n544) wherein it was observed as under:\n“It is also a settled proposition of law that when a tenant disputes\nthe very ownership of the landlord, the only recourse available\nwith him is to file a civil suit.”\n\nIt is a settled proposition of law that matters concerning rent and\nownership of the property have to be dealt with in accordance with the\nfacts pertaining to those cases separately and independently. It is an\nadmitted position on behalf of the petitioners that the issue with regard\nto the ownership of the property is pending adjudication; hence, any\n\nobservation on the said issue would prejudice the case of both the parties.\n\n10. Reverting back to the facts of the case at hand, it is an admitted\nposition that the deceased was the tenant of MFB, who took the said\npremises on rent sometime in 1979. It is also an admitted position that\nthe petitioners claim ownership of the property in dispute on the basis of\nthe sale agreement dated 10.11.1987. The petitioners claim that a stay\nwas operating in the suit, and during the pendency of the suit, the\nattorney of MFB, namely, MA, illegally sold out the property to GM. From\nthe perusal of the record it reveals that suit No. 702/89 (renumbered as\n1579/96) was dismissed on account of non-prosecution vide order dated\n19.01.2001, which was then restored in the year 2006; however, in the\nmeantime, the sale deed dated 21.07.2021 was executed in favour of the\nrespondent by MFB through her attorney MA, meaning thereby that when\nthe property was sold-out, there was no stay operating in the field, as\nclaimed by the petitioners. Hence, on this aspect, we repel the argument\nof Raja Qasit Nawaz Khan, ASC for the petitioners that in spite of the stay\ngranted by the Court MFB, through her attorney MA, has illegally sold\n\nout the property in question to GM, which aspect is found to be contrary\n\nof the record.\n\n11. It is also an admitted position that GM, after purchasing the\nproperty in 2001, duly informed the deceased by complying with the\nprovisions of Section 18 of the SRPO’79 by virtue of notice dated\n30.12.2002, that since he has purchased the property and now is the\nowner of the same, hence the petitioners should now start paying rent to\nhim. In response to this, no reply was furnished by the deceased. It is in\nthis backdrop that an application under section 15 of the SRPO’79 was\nfiled by GM along with an application under Section 16(1) of the SRPO’79\nfor payment of the rent/arrears etc. Perusal of the order of the Trial Court\ndated 08.03.2008 in R.C. No. 153/2003 reveals that when the said case\nwas filed by the respondent, the present petitioners not only filed their\nwritten statements but also raised preliminary objections with regard to\nthe maintainability of the said application, which were duly considered\nby the Trial Court. It is further noted that the Trial Court directed both\nthe parties to lead their evidences and other material to prove their\naverments. It is evident from page 162 of the paper book that various\ndocuments were filed before the learned Trial Court which were duly\nexamined, exhibited and considered by the said Court. The order of the\nTrial Court further reveals that witnesses were examined and after\nconsidering all these aspects the said Court came to the conclusion that\nthe petitioners have admitted that prior to 1987 they were paying rent of\nthe premises to MFB and hence, according to the Trial Court, since the\nrespondent has stepped into the shoes of the previous landlord, hence,\nfor all practical purposes, GM has to be considered as a new landlord and\nthus, there existed a relationship of landlord and tenant between the\nparties. The Trial Court, in our view, was therefore justified in passing a\ntentative rent order requiring the present petitioners to pay the rent as\n\nwell as the arrears thereof. The Trial Court was justified in fixing the rent\n\nfrom 2001, i.e. the date of the purchase of the property, and to fix future\n\n8\nmonthly rent in accordance with law after considering all aspects of the\nmatter and other factors required in fixing a tentative rent. It would not\nbe out of place to mention that against the order of the Trial Court dated\n08.03.2008 a Constitution Petition was also filed by the present\npetitioners before the High Court bearing C.P. No. 144/2008 challenging\nthe order of the Trial Court passed under Section 16(1) of SPRO’79 vide\norder dated 09.11.2017. It was then that an order on the application\nunder section 16(2) of the SRPO’79 was passed by the Trial Court on\n29.01.2018 by striking off the defence of the present petitioners. In this\nregard, the decision given in the case of Syed Asghar Hussain versus\nMuhammad Owais and others (2018 SCMR 1720) is relevant wherein a\nDivision Bench of this Court observed “that by non-compliance with a\n\ntentative rent order the tenant loses his right of defence.”\n\n12. Perusal of the order of the Appellate Court dated 14.11.2018 also\nreveals that the aspect of whether the present petitioners are in\noccupation of the premises and whether there existed a relationship of\nlandlord and tenant was categorically examined in detail and thereafter\nthe said Court answered both the questions in the affirmative, clearly\nmentioning that the present petitioners are in occupation of the premises\nand that there exists a relationship of landlord and tenant between them.\nThe Appellate Court has carefully examined the contentions of both\nparties and has also scrutinized the record and other documents before\naffirming the order of the Trial Court, thereby reaching to the conclusion\nthat the respondent was able to prove his bona fides in respect of the\nmatter and that default on the part of the petitioners has duly been\nestablished. Perusal of the record also reveals that the Appellate Court\nalso quite rightly did not touch upon the aspect of the dispute of\n\nownership of the property between the parties which, as stated above,\n\nwas pending adjudication. Perusal of the record further reveals that\n\nCP 1032-K OF 2025\n9\n\nduring the cross-examination, the petitioners admitted that they would\npay the rent of the premises to the attorney of MFB, namely, MA, by fully\nadmitting that they were tenants of the property; however, their stance\nchanged when they submitted that, since they became owners of the\nproperty by virtue of a sale agreement, hence they are not required to pay\n\nany rent.\n\n13. Perusal of the order of the High Court also demonstrates that the\nlearned Single Judge quite rightly did not touch upon the issue of\nownership of the property but, while affirming the decisions of the two\nCourts below, came to the conclusion that in respect of such like matters\nbetween the tenant and the landlord, the legal requirement is that a\ntenant must first vacate the said premises before raising any dispute\nregarding ownership, if any. The High Court, in our view, quite rightly\nrelied upon the various decisions of this Cout whiling affirming the\n\nconcurrent findings recorded by the two Courts below.\n\n14. In the case of Ashiq Ali and another versus Mehar Elahi and 13\n\nothers (2001 SCMR 130), it was observed by a three-member Bench of\n\nthis Court that where an order under Section 16(1) of the SRPO’79 is\npassed by the Rent Controller and there is non-compliance with the\nsame, the Rent Controller is duly authorized under Section 16(2) of the\nSRPO’79 to strike off the defence of the tenant for non-compliance with\nrespect to the deposit of the rent as determined by the Court. In the\ninstant matter, it is an admitted position that at no point in time the\norder passed by the Trial Court was complied with by the present\npetitioners. In the case of Muhammad Iqbal Haider versus Ist ADJ,\nKarachi Central and others (PLD 2018 SC 35), similar view was taken\n\nby a three-member Bench of this Court that “institution of civil suits for\n\nspecific performance of agreement and cancellation of sale deed would\n\nCP 1032-K OF 2025\n10\n\nnot justify non-compliance of the order passed by the Ren Controller\nunder Section 16(1) of the SRPO’79.” Paragraph-7 of the said judgment\n\nis reproduced hereinbelow for ease of reference:\n\n“7, We have heard the learned ASC for the petitioner and considered his\narguments. The main thrust of the arguments advanced by him is that the\nrelationship of landlord and tenant had been denied on the basis of the\nagreements to sell executed between Respondent No.4 and the mother of\nthe petitioner. That being so, and the ownership of the property being in\ndispute, an order for payment of tentative rent under section 16(1) of the\nSRPO could not have been passed. Consequently, his defence could not\nhave been struck off for non-compliance of the said order. However, we\nhave noted that this aspect of the matter was fully addressed by this Court\nin the earlier round of litigation, The controversy relating to denial of\nrelationship of landlord and tenant and pendency of litigation between the\nparties and the legality of the order for deposit of rent was examined and\ndefinitive findings were recorded by this Court in its judgment dated\n09.06.2009 in Civil Petition No.1193 of 2008 in the following terms:-\n\n4. We have heard the petitioner as well as the learned counsel for the\ncontesting respondent No.2 at length and have also perused the available\nrecord. We find that the institution of two civil suits by the petitioner; one\nfor specific performance of agreement and the other for cancellation of sale\ndeed of the respondent No.2 per se, would not be sufficient to refuse\ncompliance of an order of the Rent Controller under section 16(1) of the\nOrdinance pending final determination. Reliance can be placed on the\ncases of Nazir Ahmed v. Mst. Sardar Bibi and others (1989 SCMR 913),\nMst. Bor Bibi v. Abdul Qadir (1996 SCMR 87), Waheedullah v. Mst. Rehana\nNasim and others (2004 SCMR 1568), Haji Jumma Khan v. Haji Zarin\nKhan (PLD 1999 SC 1101), Khawaja Ammar Hussain v. Muhammad\nShabbiruddin Khan (PLD 1986 Karachi 74), Habib Khan v. Haji Haroon-\nur- Rasheed (1989 CLC 783); Gohar Ali Shah v, Shahzada Alam (2000\nMLD 82), Iqbal and others v. Mst. Rabia Bibi and another (PLD 1991 SC\n242) and Syed Imran Ahmed v. Bilal and another (Civil Appeal No.2230 of\n2008 decided by this Court on 9.6.2009), Once the petitioner was prima\nfacie, shown to be inducted as a tenant of the demised premises, he could\nnot claim any exemption from payment of rent on account of institution of\nsuits for specific performance and for cancellation of sale deed. Article 115\nof the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 lays down that no tenant of\nimmovable property shall, during the continuance of the tenancy, be\npermitted to deny that his landlord had a title to such property. The\nrelationship of landlord and a tenant is not severed even if the execution\nof an agreement to sell is admitted. The petitioner was not absolved of his\nresponsibility of compliance of order passed by the Rent Controller under\n\nthe provisions of section 16 of the Ordinance for making of payment of\n\nCP 1032-K OF 2025\n11\narrears and future rent. In our view, the impugned judgment of the High\nCourt is plainly correct to which no exception can be taken.\n\n5. For the foregoing reasons, we do not find any merit in this petition\nwhich is dismissed and leave to appeal is refused accordingly.”\n\n15. Hence, if an order under Section 16(1) of the SRPO’79 is not\ncomplied with, it is a well-settled principle of law that the defence of the\nother side is struck off, being a mandatory requirement of law. In the\ninstant matter, it is an admitted position that non-compliance with the\norder passed under Section 16(1) of the SRPO’79 was made by the\npetitioner, which prompted the Trial Court to pass an order under Section\n16(2) of the SRPO’79, which, in our view, was rightly upheld by the\n\nAppellate Court as well as the High Court. In the case of Bashir Ahmed\n\nversus Messrs. Roots School Network through Administrator/owner\n\nand others (2011 SCMR 290) by a Division Bench of this Court, in\n\nparagraph No.6 of the judgment, it was observed as under:\n\n“6. The issue in contention before us is confined to the question as to\nwhether the admitted failure of the respondent to comply with the\ntentative rent order dated 7-2-2001, was merely technical as asserted\nby the respondent, or was willful, deliberate and contumacious as\nalleged by the, petitioner and so held by the learned Rent Controller\nand the learned appellate Court. Whether the default was technical or\nwillful, is a question of fact. This question has to be answered on the\nbasis of the record. In order to appreciate the respective positions of the\ntwo sides on this issue, it is necessary firstly to advert to the stance of\nthe respondent/tenant taken in paragraph 2 of its objections to the\napplication under section 16(2) of the SRPO. For ease of reference, the\nrelevant extract from paragraph 2 of the objections, is reproduced as\n\nunder:--\n\n\"The rent for these [five] months was in fact deposited by the opponent\nin Miscellaneous Rent Application No. 386 of 2000 instead of main case.\nBy perusal of the deposit rent receipt and Nazir Report there is no wilful\ndefault in payment of rent except technical one, whereas the opponent's\nrepresentative deposited the rent in Miscellaneous Application but not\nin the rent case. On inquiry the representative of the opponent namely\nSheraz who used to deposit the rent in Court in every month informed\nthat in this regard applicant/landlord contacted with him and\n\nrequested him not to deposit the rent in main rent case and requested\n\nCP 1032-K OF 2025\n12\n\nhim to deposit the same in Miscellaneous Rent Application No. 386 of\n2000. The reasons so given by the representative of the opponent that\napplicant requested him not to deposit the rent in main case and same\nmay be deposited in Miscellaneous Rent Application on the ground that\nit is difficult for the applicant to withdraw the rent in main case but it\nis easy for him to withdraw the rent form the Misc. Rent Application, so\nhe did it on his instigation. However, he deposited the rent in time and\n\ncommitted no default as alleged by the applicant.\"\n\n16. In the instant case, the default in respect of payment of tentative\nrent was found to be willful, deliberate and contumacious and, therefore,\nthe three Courts below, in our view, were quite right in directing the\npetitioners to vacate the premises in question on the basis of non-\ncompliance with the order passed by the Rent Controller, under\nSection 16(2) SRPO’79 and no exception to the said decisions could be\ntaken in this regard. In the matters when default has been established,\nthe only course available to the tenants either claiming ownership of\nthe rented premises or denying the relationship of the landlord and\ntenant is to vacate the said premises and to pursue their civil suits,\nand upon favourable judgment by a competent court, they may claim\nthe possession of the property afterwards. In the case of Mst.\nMussarrat Shaheen versus Mst. Verbeena Khan Afroz and others\n(2024 SCMR 1796), vide paragraphs 8 and 9 of the judgment, passed\n\nby a three-member Bench of this Court, it was observed as under:\n\n“8. With respect to the contention raised by the petitioner's counsel\nregarding the pending Civil Suit No. 303 of 2020, filed by the petitioner\nafter filing of the rent case by the respondent No.1 in 2020, which seeks\nspecific performance of the agreement dated 27.11.2009, it is essential\nto reaffirm a settled principle of law that a tenant cannot maintain\noccupancy of rented premises merely because he/she has initiated a\nsuit for declaration. In instances where the tenant asserts ownership of\nthe property, the legally mandated procedure requires the tenant to\nvacate the premises, pursue the civil suit, and, upon a favorable\njudgment by the competent court, regain possession of the property.\n\n9. Reference may be made to the case of Rehmatullah v. Ali Muhammad\nand another (1983 SCMR 1064) wherein it has been held that:\n\n13\n\n\". It is settled principle of law that if a tenant denies the propriety\nrights of the landlord then he is bound to first of all deliver the\npossession of the premises in question and then to contest his\npropriety rights in the property and if ultimately he succeeds in\ngetting relief from the court and decree is passed in his favour\nthen he can enforce the same according to law with all its\n\nconsequences...\"\n\nSimilarly, in the case of Muhammad Nisar v. Izhar Ahmed\nShaikh and others (PLD 2014 SC 347), it has been ruled that:\n\n“Per settled law in such circumstances when the tenant puts up\na plea in an eiectment application that he had purchased the\nproperty then he has to file a suit for his remedies (which has been\ndone) and vacate the premises and thereafter if he succeeds he\nwould be entitled to take possession of the premises again ...\"\n\n[Emphasis added]\n\nRecently, this court in the case of Nasir Khan v. Nadia Ali Butt\nand others (2024 SCMR 452), while delving on the similar\n\nproposition has observed that:\n\n\"...the inescapable conclusion is that a tenant remains a\ntenant, he cannot prolong his occupation by exercising his\nright of being subsequent purchaser unless so held by the\ncourt of competent jurisdiction. The reasons behind is\nthat he has no status to justify his possession and if he\ndenies the relationship of landlord and tenant he will be\nKnown to be an illegal occupant.\n\n12. It is trite law that a person cannot remain in occupation\nof rented -premises simply because he asserts to be the\nowner of the rented premises and has instituted a suit for\n\ndeclaration in this regard.\"\n\n17. In the instant matter, it is established that since ownership of\nthe property has been claimed and disputed, and civil suits are\npending, the only course available to the present petitioners is to\npursue the said previous civil suits; they, however, have to vacate the\npremises in question. In case of any favourable judgment, they may\nclaim the possession of the said property afterwards, but in the present\ncircumstances, they cannot be allowed to continue in possession of the\n\nproperty. Reference in this regard may be made to the decision given\n\nCP 1032-K OF 2025\n14\n\nin the case of Abdul Rasheed versus Maqbool Ahmed and others\n(2011 SCMR 320) wherein a three-member Bench of this Court has\n\nobserved as under:\n\n“5. We have heard both the learned Advocates Supreme Court. It is\nsettled law that where in a case filed for eviction of the tenant by\nthe landlord, the former takes up a position that he has purchased\nthe property and hence is no more a tenant then he has to vacate\nthe property and file a suit for specific performance of the sale\nagreement whereafter he would be given easy access to the\npremises in case he prevails. In this regard reference can be made\nto Shameem Akhtar v. Muhammad Rashid (PLD 1989 SC 575),\nMst. Azeemun Nisar Begum v. Mst. Rabia Bibi (PLD 1991 SC 242),\nMuhammad Rafique v. Messrs Habib Bank Ltd. (1994 SCMR 1012)\nand Mst. Bor Bibi v. Abdul Qadir (1996 SCMR 877). In so far as\ndetermination of the relationship of landlord and tenant is\nconcerned, such enquiry by the Rent Controller is of a summary\nnature. Undoubtedly the premises were taken by the petitioner on\nrent from the respondent and according to the former he later on\npurchased the same which was denied by the latter. Consequently,\nthe relationship in so far as the jurisdiction of the Rent Controller\nis concerned stood established because per settled law the question\nof title to the property could never be decided by the Rent\nController. In the tentative rent order the learned Rent Controller\nhas carried out such summary exercise and decided the\n\nrelationship between the parties to exist.”\n\nSimilar view was taken by this Court in the case of Muhammad Nisar\nversus Izhar Ahmed Shaikh and others (PLD 2014 Supreme Court 347)\nwherein it was held as under:\n\n“Per settled law in such circumstances when the tenant puts\nup a plea in an ejectment application that he had purchased\nthe property then he has to file a suit for his remedies (which\nhas been done) and vacate the premises and thereafter if he\nsucceeds he would be entitled to take possession of the\n\npremises again.”\n\n18. We, therefore, in view of the above facts and circumstances and\nthe law laid down by this Court in the above-quoted judgments, have\n\ncome to the conclusion that the present respondent has been\n\nsuccessful: in establishing the relationship of landlord and tenant\n\nCP 1032-K OF 2025\n15\n\nbetween the parties and that there is a default in complying with the\ntentative rent order and thus the three Courts below were justified in\nstriking off the defence of the present petitioners and directing them to\nvacate the premises and to hand over the peaceful possession to the\npresent respondent. We thus see no reason to interfere with the\nconcurrent findings recorded by the three Courts below and, therefore,\ndismiss this petition being devoid of any merit and refuse to grant\n\nleave.

            "CleanedText": "JUDGMENT Irfan Saadat Khan, J.- This petition for leave to appeal has been filed impugning the order passed by the High Court dated 28.07.2025 in Constitution Petition No. S-2602 of 2018. 2. Briefly stated, the facts of the case are that the petitioners claim that their late father, Dr. Muhammad Bashir Qasim hereinafter referred to as the deceased , was the lawful owner of property bearing Plot No. 64-1/B, Block-6, PECHS, Survey Sheet No. 35-P/1, measuring 416.47 square yards, comprising a ground floor plus two additional stories. The petitioners admit that they were tenants of Mst. Farida Bano hereinafter referred to as MFB , the previous owner of the said property, from 1979, and were running a school under the name Greenfield Secondary School. However, in the year 1987-88, the deceased allegedly purchased the property from MFB through a sale agreement dated 10.11.1987, upon which an advance payment of Rs.50,000/- was made. The petitioners CP 1032-K OF 2025, 2 further claim that the entire sale consideration was subsequently paid either through pay orders or direct deposits into MFB s bank account. They assert that, since 1987-88, they have remained in uninterrupted possession of the premises as its absolute owners. It is also claimed that MFB issued no-objection certificates NOCs required for various government departments, and that the petitioners had paid all the utility bills prior to the purported sale. It is further claimed that, after purchasing the property, the petitioners constructed two additional floors thereon; however, despite payment of the entire sale consideration, MFB did not transfer the property in their name. 3. It was also the claim of the petitioners that MFB executed a Power of Attorney in favour of one Muhammad Aslam hereinafter referred to as MA on 13.11.1989, authorising him to effect transfer of the property in their favour. However, as no transfer ensued, the deceased instituted Suit No. 702/1989 for specific performance against MFB and MA before the High Court of Sindh. Vide interim order dated 09.06.1989, later confirmed on 17.12.1989, the High Court restrained MFB and MA from alienating, selling, or otherwise disposing of the subject property. Subsequently, on an application moved by MA dated 14.10.1991, the High Court modified its earlier restraining order, dated 17.12.1989, to the extent that MA was permitted to mortgage the property for the purpose of repaying a loan to Muslim Commercial Bank MCB . Thereafter, MA instituted a counter-suit, i.e., Suit No. 373/1999, against the petitioners as well as MFB, for recovery and injunction. Both suits were clubbed together and transferred from the High Court to the Court of the Senior Civil Judge due to enhancement in pecuniary jurisdiction, and renumbered as Suit No. 1579/1996 old No. 702/1989 and Suit No. 1526/1996 old No. 373/ 1999 , respectively. It is an admitted fact that both suits remain pending adjudication. CP 1032-K OF 2025 3 4. The present respondent, Gulzar Mehmood hereinafter referred to as GM , claiming to have purchased the property from MA through a registered sale deed dated 21.07.2001, filed a rent case under Section 15 of the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979 hereinafter referred to as SRPO , along with an application under Section 16 1 of the SRPO, bearing R.C. No. 153/2003, against the deceased. GM asserted that he had lawfully purchased the property from MFB through her attorney MA, and that by operation of law, the petitioners became his tenants, liable to pay rent with effect from 2001. After examining the record and evidence produced, the learned V Rent Controller, Karachi South, found that the applicant/GM respondent before this Court , having acquired ownership through a registered sale deed dated 21.07.2001, was entitled to receive rent from the deceased whose legal heirs are the present petitioners , who stood in a tenant-landlord relationship with him. Consequently, vide order dated 08.03.2008, the Rent Controller directed the petitioners to deposit arrears of rent from 21.07.2001 to March 2008 at the rate of Rs.25,000/- per month within one month, and to continue paying future monthly rent at the same rate subject to a 10 annual increase by the 10th of each month. 5. GM also filed an application under Section 16 2 of the SRPO for non-compliance with the tentative rent order dated 08.03.2008. This application was. allowed by the Rent Controller vide order dated 29.01.2018, whereby the defence of the petitioners was struck off and they were directed to vacate and hand over peaceful possession of the premises within 30 days of the passing of the order. Aggrieved by the said order, the deceased filed First Rent Appeal FRA No, 85/2018 before the learned District Judge, Karachi South, who, vide judgment dated 14.11.2018, affirmed the Rent Controller s order and directed the petitioners to vacate the premises within 30 days from the announcement 4 of the judgment. The petitioners then approached the High Court through Constitution Petition No. S-2602/2018, which too was decided against the petitioners by categorially observing that since the petitioners have failed to comply with the order dated 08.03.2008 passed under Section 16 1 of the SRPO, which was tentative in nature, the default in the case has been established and therefore the two Courts below were justified in striking off the defence of the present petitioners under Section 16 2 of the SRPO and rightly directed the petitioners to vacate the premises in question. The High Court further observed that since some civil dispute is pending between the parties, with regard to the ownership of the property that may be considered by the appropriate Court of law in accordance with the law. It is against this judgment that the instant civil petition for leave to appeal has been filed. 6. Raja Qasit Nawaz Khan, ASC has appeared on behalf of the petitioners and stated that all the three Courts below have erred in deciding the matter against the petitioners, without properly appreciating the fact that the petitioners, though initially from 1979 to 1987, were the tenants of MFB but had become owners of the said property by virtue of a sale agreement dated 10.11.1987 when they purchased the said property from MFB, who fraudulently had not transferred the same in their names. According to him, there was no possibility of the petitioners being treated as tenants in respect of the said property or being required to pay any rent either to MFB or to GM. The learned counsel stated that the averments of the respondent GM that he was the landlord of the property are totally incorrect as the petitioners had already purchased the property from MFB way back in 1987, whereas the claim of GM that he has purchased the property in 2001 from MA, attorney of MFB, is uncalled for. According to him, the petitioners only came to know about GM allegedly purchasing the property from MFB through her attorney CP 1032-K OF 2025 5 MA when the rent case was filed by GM before the Rent Controller, against them. He stated that the present matter is a result of connivance among MFB, her attorney MA and GM with the sole intention to dispossess the present petitioners from the property. te The learned counsel stated that the Rent Controller as well as the Appellate Court have illegally fixed the rent at the rate of Rs.25000/- per month and directed the petitioners to pay the same from 2001, which action is wholly illegal, unjustified, and without lawful authority, and have illegally struck off the defence of the petitioners and passed the impugned ejectment orders for the alleged non-compliance of the tentative rent order passed under section 16 1 of the SRPO 79. He stressed that MFB, MA and GM have miserably failed to establish their ownership over the property. He stated that the NOC issued by MFB to the petitioners was an ample proof that the petitioners acquired the ownership rights. He submitted that production of sale agreement coupled with evidences of payment of sale consideration would prove the bona fides of the petitioners in acquiring the said property, which was not considered by the three fora below. According to him, since the petitioners were owners of the property; therefore, there was no question of paying any rent or being treated as a defaulter in respect of any alleged rent or arrears thereof. He, therefore, stated that the present petitioners vehemently deny the existence of relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties and prayed that the orders passed by the three Courts below, being illegal and uncalled for, may be set aside. 8. We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioners, gone through the impugned judgment and the law on the subject and have also examined the available record minutely. 9. At the very outset, we would like to state that the issue with regard to ownership, still pending adjudication, cannot be taken up or dilated - CP 1032-K OF 2025 6 upon. Reference in this regard may be made to the decision given in the case of Umar Gul versus Dr. Hafiza Akhtar and others 2025 SCMR 544 wherein it was observed as under: It is also a settled proposition of law that when a tenant disputes the very ownership of the landlord, the only recourse available with him is to file a civil suit. It is a settled proposition of law that matters concerning rent and ownership of the property have to be dealt with in accordance with the facts pertaining to those cases separately and independently. It is an admitted position on behalf of the petitioners that the issue with regard to the ownership of the property is pending adjudication; hence, any observation on the said issue would prejudice the case of both the parties. 10. Reverting back to the facts of the case at hand, it is an admitted position that the deceased was the tenant of MFB, who took the said premises on rent sometime in 1979. It is also an admitted position that the petitioners claim ownership of the property in dispute on the basis of the sale agreement dated 10.11.1987. The petitioners claim that a stay was operating in the suit, and during the pendency of the suit, the attorney of MFB, namely, MA, illegally sold out the property to GM. From the perusal of the record it reveals that suit No. 702/89 renumbered as 1579/96 was dismissed on account of non-prosecution vide order dated 19.01.2001, which was then restored in the year 2006; however, in the meantime, the sale deed dated 21.07.2021 was executed in favour of the respondent by MFB through her attorney MA, meaning thereby that when the property was sold-out, there was no stay operating in the field, as claimed by the petitioners. Hence, on this aspect, we repel the argument of Raja Qasit Nawaz Khan, ASC for the petitioners that in spite of the stay granted by the Court MFB, through her attorney MA, has illegally sold out the property in question to GM, which aspect is found to be contrary of the record. 11. It is also an admitted position that GM, after purchasing the property in 2001, duly informed the deceased by complying with the provisions of Section 18 of the SRPO 79 by virtue of notice dated 30.12.2002, that since he has purchased the property and now is the owner of the same, hence the petitioners should now start paying rent to him. In response to this, no reply was furnished by the deceased. It is in this backdrop that an application under section 15 of the SRPO 79 was filed by GM along with an application under Section 16 1 of the SRPO 79 for payment of the rent/arrears etc. Perusal of the order of the Trial Court dated 08.03.2008 in R.C. No. 153/2003 reveals that when the said case was filed by the respondent, the present petitioners not only filed their written statements but also raised preliminary objections with regard to the maintainability of the said application, which were duly considered by the Trial Court. It is further noted that the Trial Court directed both the parties to lead their evidences and other material to prove their averments. It is evident from of the paper book that various documents were filed before the learned Trial Court which were duly examined, exhibited and considered by the said Court. The order of the Trial Court further reveals that witnesses were examined and after considering all these aspects the said Court came to the conclusion that the petitioners have admitted that prior to 1987 they were paying rent of the premises to MFB and hence, according to the Trial Court, since the respondent has stepped into the shoes of the previous landlord, hence, for all practical purposes, GM has to be considered as a new landlord and thus, there existed a relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties. The Trial Court, in our view, was therefore justified in passing a tentative rent order requiring the present petitioners to pay the rent as well as the arrears thereof. The Trial Court was justified in fixing the rent from 2001, i.e. the date of the purchase of the property, and to fix future 8 monthly rent in accordance with law after considering all aspects of the matter and other factors required in fixing a tentative rent. It would not be out of place to mention that against the order of the Trial Court dated 08.03.2008 a Constitution Petition was also filed by the present petitioners before the High Court bearing C.P. No. 144/2008 challenging the order of the Trial Court passed under Section 16 1 of SPRO 79 vide order dated 09.11.2017. It was then that an order on the application under section 16 2 of the SRPO 79 was passed by the Trial Court on 29.01.2018 by striking off the defence of the present petitioners. In this regard, the decision given in the case of Syed Asghar Hussain versus Muhammad Owais and others 2018 SCMR 1720 is relevant wherein a Division Bench of this Court observed that by non-compliance with a tentative rent order the tenant loses his right of defence. 12. Perusal of the order of the Appellate Court dated 14.11.2018 also reveals that the aspect of whether the present petitioners are in occupation of the premises and whether there existed a relationship of landlord and tenant was categorically examined in detail and thereafter the said Court answered both the questions in the affirmative, clearly mentioning that the present petitioners are in occupation of the premises and that there exists a relationship of landlord and tenant between them. The Appellate Court has carefully examined the contentions of both parties and has also scrutinized the record and other documents before affirming the order of the Trial Court, thereby reaching to the conclusion that the respondent was able to prove his bona fides in respect of the matter and that default on the part of the petitioners has duly been established. Perusal of the record also reveals that the Appellate Court also quite rightly did not touch upon the aspect of the dispute of ownership of the property between the parties which, as stated above, was pending adjudication. Perusal of the record further reveals that CP 1032-K OF 2025 9 during the cross-examination, the petitioners admitted that they would pay the rent of the premises to the attorney of MFB, namely, MA, by fully admitting that they were tenants of the property; however, their stance changed when they submitted that, since they became owners of the property by virtue of a sale agreement, hence they are not required to pay any rent. 13. Perusal of the order of the High Court also demonstrates that the learned Single Judge quite rightly did not touch upon the issue of ownership of the property but, while affirming the decisions of the two Courts below, came to the conclusion that in respect of such like matters between the tenant and the landlord, the legal requirement is that a tenant must first vacate the said premises before raising any dispute regarding ownership, if any. The High Court, in our view, quite rightly relied upon the various decisions of this Cout whiling affirming the concurrent findings recorded by the two Courts below. 14. In the case of Ashiq Ali and another versus Mehar Elahi and 13 others 2001 SCMR 130 , it was observed by a three-member Bench of this Court that where an order under Section 16 1 of the SRPO 79 is passed by the Rent Controller and there is non-compliance with the same, the Rent Controller is duly authorized under Section 16 2 of the SRPO 79 to strike off the defence of the tenant for non-compliance with respect to the deposit of the rent as determined by the Court. In the instant matter, it is an admitted position that at no point in time the order passed by the Trial Court was complied with by the present petitioners. In the case of Muhammad Iqbal Haider versus Ist ADJ, Karachi Central and others PLD 2018 SC 35 , similar view was taken by a three-member Bench of this Court that institution of civil suits for specific performance of agreement and cancellation of sale deed would CP 1032-K OF 2025 10 not justify non-compliance of the order passed by the Ren Controller under Section 16 1 of the SRPO 79. Paragraph-7 of the said judgment is reproduced hereinbelow for ease of reference: 7, We have heard the learned ASC for the petitioner and considered his arguments. The main thrust of the arguments advanced by him is that the relationship of landlord and tenant had been denied on the basis of the agreements to sell executed between Respondent No.4 and the mother of the petitioner. That being so, and the ownership of the property being in dispute, an order for payment of tentative rent under section 16 1 of the SRPO could not have been passed. Consequently, his defence could not have been struck off for non-compliance of the said order. However, we have noted that this aspect of the matter was fully addressed by this Court in the earlier round of litigation, The controversy relating to denial of relationship of landlord and tenant and pendency of litigation between the parties and the legality of the order for deposit of rent was examined and definitive findings were recorded by this Court in its judgment dated 09.06.2009 in Civil Petition No.1193 of 2008 in the following terms:- 4. We have heard the petitioner as well as the learned counsel for the contesting respondent No.2 at length and have also perused the available record. We find that the institution of two civil suits by the petitioner; one for specific performance of agreement and the other for cancellation of sale deed of the respondent No.2 per se, would not be sufficient to refuse compliance of an order of the Rent Controller under section 16 1 of the Ordinance pending final determination. Reliance can be placed on the cases of Nazir Ahmed v. Mst. Sardar Bibi and others 1989 SCMR 913 , Mst. Bor Bibi v. Abdul Qadir 1996 SCMR 87 , Waheedullah v. Mst. Rehana Nasim and others 2004 SCMR 1568 , Haji Jumma Khan v. Haji Zarin Khan PLD 1999 SC 1101 , Khawaja Ammar Hussain v. Muhammad Shabbiruddin Khan PLD 1986 Karachi 74 , Habib Khan v. Haji Haroonur- Rasheed 1989 CLC 783 ; Gohar Ali Shah v, Shahzada Alam 2000 MLD 82 , Iqbal and others v. Mst. Rabia Bibi and another PLD 1991 SC 242 and Syed Imran Ahmed v. Bilal and another Civil Appeal No.2230 of 2008 decided by this Court on 9.6.2009 , Once the petitioner was prima facie, shown to be inducted as a tenant of the demised premises, he could not claim any exemption from payment of rent on account of institution of suits for specific performance and for cancellation of sale deed. Article 115 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 lays down that no tenant of immovable property shall, during the continuance of the tenancy, be permitted to deny that his landlord had a title to such property. The relationship of landlord and a tenant is not severed even if the execution of an agreement to sell is admitted. The petitioner was not absolved of his responsibility of compliance of order passed by the Rent Controller under the provisions of section 16 of the Ordinance for making of payment of CP 1032-K OF 2025 11 arrears and future rent. In our view, the impugned judgment of the High Court is plainly correct to which no exception can be taken. 5. For the foregoing reasons, we do not find any merit in this petition which is dismissed and leave to appeal is refused accordingly. 15. Hence, if an order under Section 16 1 of the SRPO 79 is not complied with, it is a well-settled principle of law that the defence of the other side is struck off, being a mandatory requirement of law. In the instant matter, it is an admitted position that non-compliance with the order passed under Section 16 1 of the SRPO 79 was made by the petitioner, which prompted the Trial Court to pass an order under Section 16 2 of the SRPO 79, which, in our view, was rightly upheld by the Appellate Court as well as the High Court. In the case of Bashir Ahmed versus Messrs. Roots School Network through Administrator/owner and others 2011 SCMR 290 by a Division Bench of this Court, in paragraph No.6 of the judgment, it was observed as under: 6. The issue in contention before us is confined to the question as to whether the admitted failure of the respondent to comply with the tentative rent order dated 7-2-2001, was merely technical as asserted by the respondent, or was willful, deliberate and contumacious as alleged by the, petitioner and so held by the learned Rent Controller and the learned appellate Court. Whether the default was technical or willful, is a question of fact. This question has to be answered on the basis of the record. In order to appreciate the respective positions of the two sides on this issue, it is necessary firstly to advert to the stance of the respondent/tenant taken in paragraph 2 of its objections to the application under section 16 2 of the SRPO. For ease of reference, the relevant extract from paragraph 2 of the objections, is reproduced as under:-- The rent for these five months was in fact deposited by the opponent in Miscellaneous Rent Application No. 386 of 2000 instead of main case. By perusal of the deposit rent receipt and Nazir Report there is no wilful default in payment of rent except technical one, whereas the opponent s representative deposited the rent in Miscellaneous Application but not in the rent case. On inquiry the representative of the opponent namely Sheraz who used to deposit the rent in Court in every month informed that in this regard applicant/landlord contacted with him and requested him not to deposit the rent in main rent case and requested CP 1032-K OF 2025 12 him to deposit the same in Miscellaneous Rent Application No. 386 of 2000. The reasons so given by the representative of the opponent that applicant requested him not to deposit the rent in main case and same may be deposited in Miscellaneous Rent Application on the ground that it is difficult for the applicant to withdraw the rent in main case but it is easy for him to withdraw the rent form the Misc. Rent Application, so he did it on his instigation. However, he deposited the rent in time and committed no default as alleged by the applicant. 16. In the instant case, the default in respect of payment of tentative rent was found to be willful, deliberate and contumacious and, therefore, the three Courts below, in our view, were quite right in directing the petitioners to vacate the premises in question on the basis of noncompliance with the order passed by the Rent Controller, under Section 16 2 SRPO 79 and no exception to the said decisions could be taken in this regard. In the matters when default has been established, the only course available to the tenants either claiming ownership of the rented premises or denying the relationship of the landlord and tenant is to vacate the said premises and to pursue their civil suits, and upon favourable judgment by a competent court, they may claim the possession of the property afterwards. In the case of Mst. Mussarrat Shaheen versus Mst. Verbeena Khan Afroz and others 2024 SCMR 1796 , vide paragraphs 8 and 9 of the judgment, passed by a three-member Bench of this Court, it was observed as under: 8. With respect to the contention raised by the petitioner s counsel regarding the pending Civil Suit No. 303 of 2020, filed by the petitioner after filing of the rent case by the respondent No.1 in 2020, which seeks specific performance of the agreement dated 27.11.2009, it is essential to reaffirm a settled principle of law that a tenant cannot maintain occupancy of rented premises merely because he/she has initiated a suit for declaration. In instances where the tenant asserts ownership of the property, the legally mandated procedure requires the tenant to vacate the premises, pursue the civil suit, and, upon a favorable judgment by the competent court, regain possession of the property. 9. Reference may be made to the case of Rehmatullah v. Ali Muhammad and another 1983 SCMR 1064 wherein it has been held that: 13 . It is settled principle of law that if a tenant denies the propriety rights of the landlord then he is bound to first of all deliver the possession of the premises in question and then to contest his propriety rights in the property and if ultimately he succeeds in getting relief from the court and decree is passed in his favour then he can enforce the same according to law with all its consequences... Similarly, in the case of Muhammad Nisar v. Izhar Ahmed Shaikh and others PLD 2014 SC 347 , it has been ruled that: Per settled law in such circumstances when the tenant puts up a plea in an eiectment application that he had purchased the property then he has to file a suit for his remedies which has been done and vacate the premises and thereafter if he succeeds he would be entitled to take possession of the premises again ... Emphasis added Recently, this court in the case of Nasir Khan v. Nadia Ali Butt and others 2024 SCMR 452 , while delving on the similar proposition has observed that: ...the inescapable conclusion is that a tenant remains a tenant, he cannot prolong his occupation by exercising his right of being subsequent purchaser unless so held by the court of competent jurisdiction. The reasons behind is that he has no status to justify his possession and if he denies the relationship of landlord and tenant he will be Known to be an illegal occupant. 12. It is trite law that a person cannot remain in occupation of rented -premises simply because he asserts to be the owner of the rented premises and has instituted a suit for declaration in this regard. 17. In the instant matter, it is established that since ownership of the property has been claimed and disputed, and civil suits are pending, the only course available to the present petitioners is to pursue the said previous civil suits; they, however, have to vacate the premises in question. In case of any favourable judgment, they may claim the possession of the said property afterwards, but in the present circumstances, they cannot be allowed to continue in possession of the property. Reference in this regard may be made to the decision given CP 1032-K OF 2025 14 in the case of Abdul Rasheed versus Maqbool Ahmed and others 2011 SCMR 320 wherein a three-member Bench of this Court has observed as under: 5. We have heard both the learned Advocates Supreme Court. It is settled law that where in a case filed for eviction of the tenant by the landlord, the former takes up a position that he has purchased the property and hence is no more a tenant then he has to vacate the property and file a suit for specific performance of the sale agreement whereafter he would be given easy access to the premises in case he prevails. In this regard reference can be made to Shameem Akhtar v. Muhammad Rashid PLD 1989 SC 575 , Mst. Azeemun Nisar Begum v. Mst. Rabia Bibi PLD 1991 SC 242 , Muhammad Rafique v. Messrs Habib Bank Ltd. 1994 SCMR 1012 and Mst. Bor Bibi v. Abdul Qadir 1996 SCMR 877 . In so far as determination of the relationship of landlord and tenant is concerned, such enquiry by the Rent Controller is of a summary nature. Undoubtedly the premises were taken by the petitioner on rent from the respondent and according to the former he later on purchased the same which was denied by the latter. Consequently, the relationship in so far as the jurisdiction of the Rent Controller is concerned stood established because per settled law the question of title to the property could never be decided by the Rent Controller. In the tentative rent order the learned Rent Controller has carried out such summary exercise and decided the relationship between the parties to exist. Similar view was taken by this Court in the case of Muhammad Nisar versus Izhar Ahmed Shaikh and others PLD 2014 Supreme Court 347 wherein it was held as under: Per settled law in such circumstances when the tenant puts up a plea in an ejectment application that he had purchased the property then he has to file a suit for his remedies which has been done and vacate the premises and thereafter if he succeeds he would be entitled to take possession of the premises again. 18. We, therefore, in view of the above facts and circumstances and the law laid down by this Court in the above-quoted judgments, have come to the conclusion that the present respondent has been successful: in establishing the relationship of landlord and tenant CP 1032-K OF 2025 15 between the parties and that there is a default in complying with the tentative rent order and thus the three Courts below were justified in striking off the defence of the present petitioners and directing them to vacate the premises and to hand over the peaceful possession to the present respondent. We thus see no reason to interfere with the concurrent findings recorded by the three Courts below and, therefore, dismiss this petition being devoid of any merit and refuse to grant leave.

                "It is also claimed that MFB issued no-objection certificates NOCs required for various government departments, and that the petitioners had paid all the utility bills prior to the purported sale.",
                "It is further claimed that, after purchasing the property, the petitioners constructed two additional floors thereon; however, despite payment of the entire sale consideration, MFB did not transfer the property in their name.",

                "However, as no transfer ensued, the deceased instituted Suit No. 702/1989 for specific performance against MFB and MA before the High Court of Sindh.",
                "Vide interim order dated 09.06.1989, later confirmed on 17.12.1989, the High Court restrained MFB and MA from alienating, selling, or otherwise disposing of the subject property.",
                "Subsequently, on an application moved by MA dated 14.10.1991, the High Court modified its earlier restraining order, dated 17.12.1989, to the extent that MA was permitted to mortgage the property for the purpose of repaying a loan to Muslim Commercial Bank MCB .",
                "Thereafter, MA instituted a counter-suit, i.e., Suit No. 373/1999, against the petitioners as well as MFB, for recovery and injunction.",

                "GM asserted that he had lawfully purchased the property from MFB through her attorney MA, and that by operation of law, the petitioners became his tenants, liable to pay rent with effect from 2001.",
                "After examining the record and evidence produced, the learned V Rent Controller, Karachi South, found that the applicant/GM respondent before this Court , having acquired ownership through a registered sale deed dated 21.07.2001, was entitled to receive rent from the deceased whose legal heirs are the present petitioners , who stood in a tenant-landlord relationship with him.",
                "Consequently, vide order dated 08.03.2008, the Rent Controller directed the petitioners to deposit arrears of rent from 21.07.2001 to March 2008 at the rate of Rs.25,000/- per month within one month, and to continue paying future monthly rent at the same rate subject to a 10 annual increase by the 10th of each month.",
                "GM also filed an application under Section 16 2 of the SRPO for non-compliance with the tentative rent order dated 08.03.2008.",
                "allowed by the Rent Controller vide order dated 29.01.2018, whereby the defence of the petitioners was struck off and they were directed to vacate and hand over peaceful possession of the premises within 30 days of the passing of the order.",
                "Aggrieved by the said order, the deceased filed First Rent Appeal FRA No, 85/2018 before the learned District Judge, Karachi South, who, vide judgment dated 14.11.2018, affirmed the Rent Controller s order and directed the petitioners to vacate the premises within 30 days from the announcement 4 of the judgment.",
                "The petitioners then approached the High Court through Constitution Petition No. S-2602/2018, which too was decided against the petitioners by categorially observing that since the petitioners have failed to comply with the order dated 08.03.2008 passed under Section 16 1 of the SRPO, which was tentative in nature, the default in the case has been established and therefore the two Courts below were justified in striking off the defence of the present petitioners under Section 16 2 of the SRPO and rightly directed the petitioners to vacate the premises in question.",
                "The High Court further observed that since some civil dispute is pending between the parties, with regard to the ownership of the property that may be considered by the appropriate Court of law in accordance with the law.",
                "It is against this judgment that the instant civil petition for leave to appeal has been filed.",
                "Raja Qasit Nawaz Khan, ASC has appeared on behalf of the petitioners and stated that all the three Courts below have erred in deciding the matter against the petitioners, without properly appreciating the fact that the petitioners, though initially from 1979 to 1987, were the tenants of MFB but had become owners of the said property by virtue of a sale agreement dated 10.11.1987 when they purchased the said property from MFB, who fraudulently had not transferred the same in their names.",
                "According to him, there was no possibility of the petitioners being treated as tenants in respect of the said property or being required to pay any rent either to MFB or to GM.",
                "The learned counsel stated that the averments of the respondent GM that he was the landlord of the property are totally incorrect as the petitioners had already purchased the property from MFB way back in 1987, whereas the claim of GM that he has purchased the property in 2001 from MA, attorney of MFB, is uncalled for.",
                "According to him, the petitioners only came to know about GM allegedly purchasing the property from MFB through her attorney CP 1032-K OF 2025 5 MA when the rent case was filed by GM before the Rent Controller, against them.",
                "He stated that the present matter is a result of connivance among MFB, her attorney MA and GM with the sole intention to dispossess the present petitioners from the property.",
                "te The learned counsel stated that the Rent Controller as well as the Appellate Court have illegally fixed the rent at the rate of Rs.25000/- per month and directed the petitioners to pay the same from 2001, which action is wholly illegal, unjustified, and without lawful authority, and have illegally struck off the defence of the petitioners and passed the impugned ejectment orders for the alleged non-compliance of the tentative rent order passed under section 16 1 of the SRPO 79.",
                "He stressed that MFB, MA and GM have miserably failed to establish their ownership over the property.",
                "He stated that the NOC issued by MFB to the petitioners was an ample proof that the petitioners acquired the ownership rights.",
                "He submitted that production of sale agreement coupled with evidences of payment of sale consideration would prove the bona fides of the petitioners in acquiring the said property, which was not considered by the three fora below.",
                "According to him, since the petitioners were owners of the property; therefore, there was no question of paying any rent or being treated as a defaulter in respect of any alleged rent or arrears thereof.",
                "He, therefore, stated that the present petitioners vehemently deny the existence of relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties and prayed that the orders passed by the three Courts below, being illegal and uncalled for, may be set aside.",
                "We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioners, gone through the impugned judgment and the law on the subject and have also examined the available record minutely.",
                "At the very outset, we would like to state that the issue with regard to ownership, still pending adjudication, cannot be taken up or dilated - CP 1032-K OF 2025 6 upon.",
                "Reference in this regard may be made to the decision given in the case of Umar Gul versus Dr. Hafiza Akhtar and others 2025 SCMR 544 wherein it was observed as under: It is also a settled proposition of law that when a tenant disputes the very ownership of the landlord, the only recourse available with him is to file a civil suit.",
                "It is a settled proposition of law that matters concerning rent and ownership of the property have to be dealt with in accordance with the facts pertaining to those cases separately and independently.",
                "It is an admitted position on behalf of the petitioners that the issue with regard to the ownership of the property is pending adjudication; hence, any observation on the said issue would prejudice the case of both the parties.",
                "Reverting back to the facts of the case at hand, it is an admitted position that the deceased was the tenant of MFB, who took the said premises on rent sometime in 1979.",
                "It is also an admitted position that the petitioners claim ownership of the property in dispute on the basis of the sale agreement dated 10.11.1987.",
                "The petitioners claim that a stay was operating in the suit, and during the pendency of the suit, the attorney of MFB, namely, MA, illegally sold out the property to GM.",
                "From the perusal of the record it reveals that suit No. 702/89 renumbered as 1579/96 was dismissed on account of non-prosecution vide order dated 19.01.2001, which was then restored in the year 2006; however, in the meantime, the sale deed dated 21.07.2021 was executed in favour of the respondent by MFB through her attorney MA, meaning thereby that when the property was sold-out, there was no stay operating in the field, as claimed by the petitioners.",
                "Hence, on this aspect, we repel the argument of Raja Qasit Nawaz Khan, ASC for the petitioners that in spite of the stay granted by the Court MFB, through her attorney MA, has illegally sold out the property in question to GM, which aspect is found to be contrary of the record.",
                "It is also an admitted position that GM, after purchasing the property in 2001, duly informed the deceased by complying with the provisions of Section 18 of the SRPO 79 by virtue of notice dated 30.12.2002, that since he has purchased the property and now is the owner of the same, hence the petitioners should now start paying rent to him.",
                "In response to this, no reply was furnished by the deceased.",
                "It is in this backdrop that an application under section 15 of the SRPO 79 was filed by GM along with an application under Section 16 1 of the SRPO 79 for payment of the rent/arrears etc.",
                "Perusal of the order of the Trial Court dated 08.03.2008 in R.C.",
                "No. 153/2003 reveals that when the said case was filed by the respondent, the present petitioners not only filed their written statements but also raised preliminary objections with regard to the maintainability of the said application, which were duly considered by the Trial Court.",
                "It is further noted that the Trial Court directed both the parties to lead their evidences and other material to prove their averments.",
                "It is evident from of the paper book that various documents were filed before the learned Trial Court which were duly examined, exhibited and considered by the said Court.",
                "The order of the Trial Court further reveals that witnesses were examined and after considering all these aspects the said Court came to the conclusion that the petitioners have admitted that prior to 1987 they were paying rent of the premises to MFB and hence, according to the Trial Court, since the respondent has stepped into the shoes of the previous landlord, hence, for all practical purposes, GM has to be considered as a new landlord and thus, there existed a relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties.",
                "The Trial Court, in our view, was therefore justified in passing a tentative rent order requiring the present petitioners to pay the rent as well as the arrears thereof.",
                "The Trial Court was justified in fixing the rent from 2001, i.e.",
                "the date of the purchase of the property, and to fix future 8 monthly rent in accordance with law after considering all aspects of the matter and other factors required in fixing a tentative rent.",
                "It would not be out of place to mention that against the order of the Trial Court dated 08.03.2008 a Constitution Petition was also filed by the present petitioners before the High Court bearing C.P.",
                "No. 144/2008 challenging the order of the Trial Court passed under Section 16 1 of SPRO 79 vide order dated 09.11.2017.",
                "It was then that an order on the application under section 16 2 of the SRPO 79 was passed by the Trial Court on 29.01.2018 by striking off the defence of the present petitioners.",
                "In this regard, the decision given in the case of Syed Asghar Hussain versus Muhammad Owais and others 2018 SCMR 1720 is relevant wherein a Division Bench of this Court observed that by non-compliance with a tentative rent order the tenant loses his right of defence.",
                "Perusal of the order of the Appellate Court dated 14.11.2018 also reveals that the aspect of whether the present petitioners are in occupation of the premises and whether there existed a relationship of landlord and tenant was categorically examined in detail and thereafter the said Court answered both the questions in the affirmative, clearly mentioning that the present petitioners are in occupation of the premises and that there exists a relationship of landlord and tenant between them.",
                "The Appellate Court has carefully examined the contentions of both parties and has also scrutinized the record and other documents before affirming the order of the Trial Court, thereby reaching to the conclusion that the respondent was able to prove his bona fides in respect of the matter and that default on the part of the petitioners has duly been established.",
                "Perusal of the record also reveals that the Appellate Court also quite rightly did not touch upon the aspect of the dispute of ownership of the property between the parties which, as stated above, was pending adjudication.",
                "Perusal of the record further reveals that CP 1032-K OF 2025 9 during the cross-examination, the petitioners admitted that they would pay the rent of the premises to the attorney of MFB, namely, MA, by fully admitting that they were tenants of the property; however, their stance changed when they submitted that, since they became owners of the property by virtue of a sale agreement, hence they are not required to pay any rent.",
                "Perusal of the order of the High Court also demonstrates that the learned Single Judge quite rightly did not touch upon the issue of ownership of the property but, while affirming the decisions of the two Courts below, came to the conclusion that in respect of such like matters between the tenant and the landlord, the legal requirement is that a tenant must first vacate the said premises before raising any dispute regarding ownership, if any.",
                "The High Court, in our view, quite rightly relied upon the various decisions of this Cout whiling affirming the concurrent findings recorded by the two Courts below.",
                "In the case of Ashiq Ali and another versus Mehar Elahi and 13 others 2001 SCMR 130 , it was observed by a three-member Bench of this Court that where an order under Section 16 1 of the SRPO 79 is passed by the Rent Controller and there is non-compliance with the same, the Rent Controller is duly authorized under Section 16 2 of the SRPO 79 to strike off the defence of the tenant for non-compliance with respect to the deposit of the rent as determined by the Court.",
                "In the instant matter, it is an admitted position that at no point in time the order passed by the Trial Court was complied with by the present petitioners.",

                "Paragraph-7 of the said judgment is reproduced hereinbelow for ease of reference: 7, We have heard the learned ASC for the petitioner and considered his arguments.",
                "The main thrust of the arguments advanced by him is that the relationship of landlord and tenant had been denied on the basis of the agreements to sell executed between Respondent No.4 and the mother of the petitioner.",
                "That being so, and the ownership of the property being in dispute, an order for payment of tentative rent under section 16 1 of the SRPO could not have been passed.",
                "Consequently, his defence could not have been struck off for non-compliance of the said order.",
                "However, we have noted that this aspect of the matter was fully addressed by this Court in the earlier round of litigation, The controversy relating to denial of relationship of landlord and tenant and pendency of litigation between the parties and the legality of the order for deposit of rent was examined and definitive findings were recorded by this Court in its judgment dated 09.06.2009 in Civil Petition No.1193 of 2008 in the following terms:- 4.",

Petitioner(s)\nVersus\n\nMst. Zaib un Nisa and others .... Respondent(s)\n\nFor the Petitioner(s) : Ms. Farhana Qamar, ASC\n\nMr. Syed Rifaqat Hussain Shah, AOR\nFor the Respondent(s) : Mr. M. Asif Mukhtar Butt, ASC\nDate of Hearing : 20.08.2025\nJUDGMENT\n\nSyed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, J.- Through this Civil Petition for Leave to\n\nAppeal, the Petitioner has called in question the Judgment dated\n20.11.2024 [Impugned Judgment’ passed by the Lahore High Court\nat Rawalpindi [High Court’ in Writ Petition No. 3346 of 2018 whereby,\nthe High Court reversed the Judgment dated 05.11.2018 of the\nAdditional District Judge, Taxila [Revisional Court’, thereby restoring\nthe Order dated 10.07.2018 passed in the execution proceedings by\nthe learned Family Judge, Taxila.\n\n2. The background of the matter, in brief, is that respondent No.1\ninstituted a Family Suit for recovery of dower, dowry articles and\nmaintenance of minor, which was adjudicated by the learned Family\nJudge, Taxila vide Judgment and Decree dated 17.12.2016 [Judgment\nand Decree]. In clear terms, the relevant part of Decree provided as\n\nfollows:\n\n“\n\n....1. Suit of the Plaintiff for recovery of dower is decreed in her favour\nand she is entitled to recover of gold ornaments weighing seven tolas\n\nor in alternative amount of Rs. 100,000/-....” (Emphasis added)\n\nThe Judgment and Decree, inter alia, recorded the prompt dower\n\namount of Rs. 100,000/- and also took note of Column No. 15 of the\n\nCivil Petition No. 74 of 2025 -2-\n\nNikahnama mentioning seven (07) tolas of gold, which had initially\nbeen given to Respondent No.1 but was later taken back by the\npetitioner. This formulation, however, gave rise to the later controversy\nwhether the entitlement was limited to Rs. 100,000/- or extended to\n\nthe prevailing market value of seven (07) tolas of gold.\n\n3. Separate appeals filed by both parties were dismissed vide\nOrder dated 28.03.2017 where the District Court held that no appeal\nlies against the Decree of dower up to Rs. 100,000/- and maintenance\n\nof Rs. 5,000/-.\n\n4. In execution proceedings, upon an application of Respondent\nNo. 1, the learned Executing Court, vide Order dated 10.07.2018\ndirected for the recovery of seven (07) tolas of gold or its current market\n\nvalue.\n\n5. The said Order was assailed by the petitioner in a Revision\nPetition, which was accepted by the Revisional Court vide Judgment\ndated 05.11.2018. It was held therein that the seven (07) tolas of gold\nmentioned in Column No. 15 of the Nikahnama was in fact given in lieu\nof Rs. 100,000/-, and that the respondent no. 1 was not entitled to the\nprevailing market value but only to the fixed sum _ of\n\nRs. 100,000/-.\n\n6. Being aggrieved by the order of the Revisional Court,\nrespondent No. 1 invoked the constitutional jurisdiction of the High\nCourt. The High Court vide the Impugned Judgment, set aside the\njudgment of the Revisional Court, thereby upholding the entitlement of\nRespondent No.1 to either the recovery of seven (07) tolas of gold or its\ncurrent market value. It is in the above backdrop that the present Civil\nPetition for Leave to Appeal has been filed by the Petitioner before this\n\nCourt.\n\n7. Learned counsel for the petitioner, while tracing the course of\nlitigation between the parties, submitted that Respondent No.1 herself\namended her Execution Petition by adding Rs. 100,000/-. This,\naccording to learned counsel, amounted to an admission that the\n\nalternate value of the dower was Rs. 100,000/-. She further argued\n\nCivil Petition No. 74 of 2025 -3-\n\nthat appeals of both the parties against the Judgment and Decree of\nthe trial court were dismissed as not maintainable on the ground that\nthe quantum of dower was Rs. 100,000/-, which also shows that the\nJudgment and Decree did not envisage seven (07) tolas of gold at its\nprevailing market value. It was, therefore, urged that the respondent\nno.1’s plea of entitlement to seven (07) tolas of gold or its current price\ntravels beyond the Judgment and Decree, and that the Revisional\nCourt rightly corrected the Executing Court by restricting the\nentitlement to PKR 100,000/-.\n\n8. Conversely, learned counsel for respondent no.1 contended\nthat the Revisional Court, by its Order dated 05.11.2018, committed\nan error of law by travelling beyond the scope of the Judgment and\nDecree. He argued that the Judgment and Decree of the trial court itself\nunambiguously entitle Respondent No.1 to recover seven (07) tolas of\ngold or, in the alternative, PKR 100,000/-. Hence, the Executing Court\nwas right in directing for the recovery of either the ornaments or its\nprevailing market value thereof. It was further submitted that where a\nJudgment and Decree provide alternate modes of satisfaction, the\nDecree-holder retains the liberty to elect the more beneficial option,\nand this principle has been recognised by this Court in the cases titled\nas Haji Muhammad Nawaz v. Samina Kanwal & others! and Mst.\nAyesha Shaheen v. Khalid Mehmood & others?. Learned counsel also\nrelied on the case titled as Haseen Ullah v. Mst. Naheed Begum and\nothers? to urge that the Court is to discern the intention of the parties\nrather than the mere form of the instrument, and that entries made in\nColumns 15 or 16 of the Nikahnama are to be treated as independent\nobligations, and not merely alternatives to the prompt dower\n\nmentioned in Column 13 of the Nikahnama.\n\n9. The learned counsel for the respondent no. 1 further argued\nthat the amendment in the Execution Petition, by insertion of Rs.\n100,000/-, was not a voluntary admission but was made upon the\nobjection of the petitioner and, importantly, respondent no.1\n\ncontended that it did not relinquish or forgo her claim for seven (07)\n\n12017 SCMR 321\n22013 SCMR 1049\n3 PLD 2022 SC 686\n\nCivil Petition No. 74 of 2025 -4-\n\ntolas gold. He submitted that the petitioner has attempted to mislead\nthe Court by portraying the amendment as a waiver by the respondent\nno.1, whereas in fact the High Court correctly appreciated the record\n\nand restored the Executing Court’s order.\n\n10. Heard the arguments of the learned counsel for the parties and\nperused the record. Having considered the submissions advanced, we\nfind no infirmity in the reasoning adopted by the High Court in the\nImpugned Judgment. The High Court correctly appreciated the scope\nof the Judgment and Decree, the conduct of the parties, and the settled\nprinciple that, where a Decree expressly affords alternate modes of\nsatisfaction, the decree-holder retains the liberty to exercise her choice.\nThe contention that the respondent no.1 voluntarily sought\namendment during execution proceeding is misconceived. The\nExecuting Court’s Order dated 18.12.2017 makes it evident that the\namendment was merely an addition of Rs. 100,000/- in consequence\nof the Petitioner’s objection, without in any way deleting, relinquishing\n\nor substituting the original stipulation of seven (07) tolas of gold.\n\n11. Most importantly, the legal principle relied upon by the learned\ncounsel for respondent no. 1 is directly applicable. A three-member\nbench of this Court in Haji Muhammad Nawaz (supra) has settled that\nan executing court can direct payment of the current market value of\ngold ornaments if their return is not possible. For clarity, the relevant\n\npart of Haji Muhammad Nawaz (supra) is reproduced below:\n\n“3. .... We are not convinced with such submission, as grant of\nrequisite relief regarding payment of price of gold ornaments at the\nprevalent market rate, in case the golden ornaments are not\n\nreturned, is fully justified and it cannot be said that it amounts to\n\n»\n\ngoing beyond the terms of decree by the executing Court. ....\n\n12. It is also a settled principle, as reaffirmed by this Court in the\ncase titled as M. Hamad Hassan v. Mst. Isma Bukhari and others*, that\nonce the trial and appellate forums have adjudicated upon a matter,\nthe constitutional courts exercise only limited supervisory jurisdiction\n\nand cannot re-appraise evidence or substitute their own opinion for\n\n42023 SCMR 1434\n\nCivil Petition No. 74 of 2025 -5-\n\nthat of the appellate court. The relevant portion of the said judgment is\n\nreproduced below:\n\n“7. .... Once a matter has been adjudicated upon on fact by the trial\nand the appellate courts, constitutional courts should not exceed their\npowers by re-evaluating the facts or substituting the appellate’s court\nopinion with their own —- the acceptance of finality of the appellate’s\ncourt finding is essential for achieving closure in legal proceedings\nconclusively resolving disputes, preventing unnecessary litigation,\nand upholding the legislature’s intent to provide a definitive resolution\n\nthrough existing appeal mechanism ....”\n\nIn our view, this authoritative pronouncement fortifies the High Court’s\nconclusion. The Impugned Judgment neither suffers from legal error\nnor reflects any perversity or misapplication of settled law. On the\ncontrary, it reinforces the principle that the Court must give effect to\nthe true intent underlying the decree and the contract from which it\n\nflows.\n\n13. In view of the above, the High Court rightly set aside the Order\ndated 05.11.2018. The Impugned Judgment is well-reasoned, based on\nproper appreciation of facts and law. No illegality, perversity, or\nmisreading and non-reading of evidence has been found in the\nImpugned Judgment. Accordingly, the instant Petition is dismissed\n\nand Leave to Appeal is refused.\n\nJudge\n\nJudge\nIslamabad\n20.08.2025\nAPPROVED FOR REPORTING\nYounus Shaikh, LC",

Brief facts of the case are that the Respondent No.1 is\nan officer of Pakistan Customs Services (hereinafter referred to as\n“PCS”) who appeared for the CSS exam held in 1996 and was\nappointed in July 1998 as Assistant Collector (BS-17). The\nRespondent No. 1 belongs to the 25 Common Training Program\n(hereinafter referred to as “CTP”) and successfully completed the\nsaid training in July 1998 and Specialized Training Program (STP)\nin February 1999 and Final Passing Out Examination (FPOE) in her\nsecond attempt. The petitioner department-FBR established the 25th\nCTP seniority in accordance with the Rule 7(4) of the Occupational\nGroup and Services (Probation, Training and Seniority Rules, 1990)\n(hereinafter referred to as \"Rules 1990\") and issued a provisional\n\nseniority list in the year 2008 and final seniority list in 2012\n\nCivil Petition No. 1002 of 2025 2\n\nwhereby, Respondent No. 1 was relegated to a lower position. She\nchallenged the said seniority list before the Federal Service Tribunal\n(hereinafter referred to as “FST”). The FST accepted the appeal of\nRespondent No. 1 together with connected appeals of the officers of\n24th CTP and vide its judgment dated 30.07.2015 held that the Rules\nof 1990 could not have been made applicable to the officers after\nthey had been promoted. The FST restored the seniority of\nRespondent No. 1 and set aside both the provisional seniority list\nissued in 2008 and the final seniority list issued in 2012. Ina\nparallel development four officers of PCS from the 24th CTP\napproached the FST to challenge the seniority list finalized by the\npetitioner department in 2012. The FST while relying upon its earlier\njudgment in the case of Respondent No. 1 dated 30.07.2015 allowed\ntheir appeals vide a judgment dated 05.01.2017. Respondent No.1\nfiled a writ petition before the Islamabad High Court seeking the\nimplementation of the judgment dated 30.07.2015 passed by the\nFST in the appeal of Respondent No.1. However, the petitioner\ndepartment being aggrieved of the judgment dated 30.07.2015\npreferred Civil Appeals No. 1219 to 1222/2015 before this August\nCourt and also preferred Civil Appeals No. 248 to 251/2018 against\nthe judgment dated 05.01.2017 whereby, the benefit of the\njudgment dated 30.07.2015 was extended. This August Court\npassed a judgment dated 20.02.2019 in favour of the respondents\nand observed that it will hear the appeals filed by the petitioner\ndepartment in case of Syed Shakeel Shah and others separately\nsince distinct questions of law and facts were involved in those\nappeals. In the other set of appeals preferred by petitioner\ndepartment against the judgment of FST dated 05.01.2017 wherein\nsimilar benefit to that of judgment dated 30.07.2015 was extended\nand adjudicated upon by this August Court on 11.12.2019 in favour\nof Respondent No.1. The petitioner department preferred reviews\nagainst judgments dated 20.02.2019 and 11.12.2019 which were\nboth dismissed vide orders dated 20.09.2019 and 07.07.2020.\nConsequently, the FBR issued revised inter-se-seniority list on\n14.06.2022, per Rules, 1990 (unamended), in contrast to the\nSeniority List issued for 24th CTP Batch, seniority whereof, was\nrestored to original, per CSS merit list. Respondent No. 1 being\naggrieved of this preferred a representation dated 15.06.2022 before\nthe FBR praying for restoration of her original seniority list per\n\nconjoined reading of judgment of this August Court in the case filed\n\nCivil Petition No. 1002 of 2025 3\n\nby the FBR against her as well as in Civil Appeals No. 248 to\n251/2018. The Respondent No.1 invoked the jurisdiction of\nIslamabad High Court under Article 187 by way of W.P. No.\n2695/2023 which was allowed vide judgment dated 10.02.2025 by\nthe learned Division Bench of the Islamabad High Court which\nremitted the matter to FST being the Executing Court. Upon\nremission the FST passed the order for implementation dated\n06.03.2025 which has been assailed by way of instant CPLA by the\n\npetitioner department.\n\n3. Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the\nlegal regime governing the redressal of grievances of civil servants\nunder the Service Tribunal Act, 1973 envisages a personal right of\nappeal and relief for each civil servant. Once a service matter is\nlitigated up to the Supreme Court and attains finality, it binds the\nparty to the outcome of that litigation to their extent. He contends\nthat while passing the impugned order dated 06.03.2025 in\nexecution proceedings that were initiated by the Respondent No. 1,\nFST has failed to properly appreciate and follow the order dated\n20.02.2019 passed by this August Court in Civil Appeals No. 1219\nto 1222/2015 related to the Respondent No. 1 and other officers of\nthe 25th CTP which has already been implemented by FBR. He\nsubmits that the Respondent No. 1 has been rightly placed at Sr\nNo.18 of the seniority list dated 21.12.2012 of BPS-18 which was\nreissued on 14.06.2022 in compliance of the above stated order of\nthis court. Learned counsel contends that feeling aggrieved of her\nplacement in the seniority list of BPS-18, the Respondent No.1\napproached the FST again in execution proceedings and while\ngranting relief to her vide impugned order dated 06.03.2025, FST\nhas wrongly applied the order dated 11.12.2019 passed by this\nAugust Court in Civil Appeals No. 248 to 251/2018 to determine the\nseniority of Respondent No.1 whereas, the said order is related to\nthe 24th CTP and not the 25™ CTP to which the Respondent No.1\nbelongs. He submits that a decision passed in the case of one civil\nservant cannot be applied and executed by the FST in favour of\nanother civil servant even if there is complete similarity in their\ncases unless a separate decision of FST on the same lines exists in\nthe latter's case which is also upheld by the Supreme Court. He\nsubmits that in the presence of a final and binding judgment by the\n\nSupreme Court fixing seniority of the 25‘ CTP officers of PCS in a\n\nCivil Petition No. 1002 of 2025 4\n\nparticular manner on appeal from and by modifying a decision of\nFST passed in the service appeals, the said officers of 25t CTP\ncannot seek to fix their seniority afresh in a different manner under\na subsequent judgment of the Supreme Court passed in the case of\n\n24th CTP Officers.\n\n4. Conversely, learned counsel for the Respondent No.1\ncontends that the issue of inter-se seniority between officers of 24th\nand 25th CTP of PCS has been in litigation since the revised seniority\nlist was issued by FBR on 21.012.2012 so as to bring the inter-se\nseniority list in consonance with the amended 1990 Rules, as\namended in 2001. He submits that the Respondent No. 1 was\nrelegated to a lower position through the revised seniority list issued\nby the FBR, based on the amendments made to the Rules 1990, in\n2001 which were applied retrospectively and to the prejudice of the\nRespondent No. 1 as she had already completed her probation and\nearned promotion in accordance with the CSS merit as held by the\njudgment given by the FST dated 30.07.2015. He further submits\nthat the above referred judgment of the FST was implemented by the\nIslamabad High Court in W.P. No. 4545/2016 and subsequently,\naffirmed by this Hon'ble Court vide judgments dated 20.02.2019 and\n11.12.2019 in an identical matter (i.e. in Muhammad Junaid Jalil\nKhan/24th CTP Case). Learned counsel contends that this Hon'ble\nCourt had endorsed the principle that once seniority has been\ndetermined and promotion is granted based on an earlier gradation\nlist, any subsequent revision thereof, is not permissible. In a parallel\nset of litigation, the FST extended the same benefit to the 24 CTP\nofficers as earlier granted by FST vide judgment dated 30.07.2015\nto the Respondent No.1. The principle asserted in the case of the\n24th CTP was the principle laid down in the case of Hameed Akhtar\nNiazi vs. Secretary Establishment (1996 SCMR 1185) which states\n\nthat relief ought to have been uniformly applied to all similarly\nplaced officers. He submits that while the seniority of 24th CTP\nofficers was revised in accordance with the CSS merit list by\nissuance of revised list on 14.06.2022 but yet the Respondent No.1\nbelonging to the 25th CTP was discriminatorily excluded,\nnotwithstanding the admitted similar facts, circumstances and legal\ncontext. He further submits that the petitioner department-FBR's\nissuance of revised seniority list was in contradiction to the advice\n\nof both Law and Justice Division and Establishment Division.\n\nCivil Petition No. 1002 of 2025 5\n\nLearned counsel contends that FBR filed review claiming both the\njudgments of 24th and 25th CTP are contradictory to one another as\nthey do not have the same set of facts and circumstances, but both\nreviews were dismissed. Learned counsel contends that the\nRespondent No.1 filed a writ petition before the Islamabad High\nCourt under Article 187 of the Constitution which was allowed vide\njudgment dated 10.02.2025 but the matter was remitted to FST\nbeing the executing court. While concluding his arguments the\nlearned counsel for the Respondent No. 1 has submitted that despite\nthe fact that the legal issue involved in the instant matter has been\ndecided in favour of the respondents up to the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt, however, since the petitioner in total disregard of such orders\nwere not complying with the said orders therefore, Respondent No.1\nwas constrained to file implementation application before the FST,\nwho has been pleased to pass the impugned order which is\nunexceptional, therefore, instant CPLA being devoid of any merits\n\nmay be dismissed.\n\n5. We have heard the learned counsel for both the parties\nand perused the impugned order as well as the record of the case.\nInstant petition for leave to appeal arises from an order dated\n06.03.2025 passed by the FST in Misc. Petition No. 258 & 259/2025\n(in Service Appeal No.460(R)/2013) in the case of Mst. Naureen\nAhmad Tarar vs. FBR. It is pertinent to note that subject Misc.\n\nPetition was remitted from Islamabad High Court vide order dated\n10.02.2025 while holding that in view of Section 5(3) of the Services\nTribunals Act, 1973 it can execute its own decisions, the\nrespondents were seeking implementation of the order of FST passed\nin Service Appeals No. 460 & 461(R)CS/2013 wherein, the\nrespondents had challenged the final seniority list for the year 2008\nwhich was issued in the year 2012, the appeals were allowed and\nseniority list issued on 21.12.2012 was set aside vide judgment\ndated 26.03.2013. The petitioner has assailed the aforesaid\njudgment by filing a Civil Appeals No. 1219 to 1222/2015 before this\nCourt which were decided on 20.02.2019 in the following terms.\n\n“12. Asa result, we hold that the 1990 Rules in their\n(unamended) form as at the commencement of the\nprobationary period in July, 1998 shall remain applicable\nfor reckoning the seniority of the private respondents on the\ncompletion of their probation in BS-17. The judgment of the\nlearned Service Tribunal is accordingly modified to the\nforegoing extent. The observations made by the learned\nService Tribunal about the workability of the 1990 Rules\n\nCivil Petition No. 1002 of 2025 6\n\npost the 2001 amendment are endorsed and for this\npurpose, the Federal Government needs to apply its mind\nto remove the salient anomalies highlighted by the learned\nService Tribunal that exist in the application and\nimplementation of the said rules. These appeals are\npartially allowed in above terms.”\n\n6. It is pertinent to mention that the appeals of Syed\nShakeel Shah and others seeking similar relief were allowed by the\nFST vide order dated 05.01.2017 with directions to the petitioner\ndepartment to consider their cases at par with the case of Mst.\nNaureen Akhtar Tarar and others. The above said judgment was\nassailed before this Court by filing Civil Appeals No. 1219 to\n1222/2015, however, the same could not be decided on the grounds\nthat separate questions of law and facts are involved therein. The\nrespondents, thereafter, sought implementation of the order of this\nCourt dated 11.12.2019 in Civil Appeals No. 248 to 251/2018, the\noperative part of which has been reproduced by the FST in the\nimpugned order to clarify its applicability on the facts and\n\ncircumstances of instant case.\n\n“2. We have asked the learned Br. ASC for the appellant\nto distinguish or show inapplicability of the order of this\nCourt dated 20.02.2019 to the present case, the learned Sr.\nASC has referred to the provision of Rule 7(4) of the\nOccupational Groups & Services (Probation, Training and\nSeniority) Rules 1990, as they stood originally before\namendment made in the year 2001, to contend that Final\nPassing out Examination was to be passed in the first\nattempt for determination of the inter-se seniority of the\nprobationers and the respondents having passed the said\nexaminations in second attempt, their seniority will be\ndetermined on that basis in that they will become juniors to\nthose who passed the said examination in the first attempt.\nThough such plea has been raised before us by the learned\nSr. ASC but we note that the probationary periods of all the\nrespondents were terminated on 03.03.2000 and on the\nbasis of Gradation List prepared by the appellant itself on\n31.12.1998, the respondents were granted promotion as\nDeputy Collector (BS-18) on 19.03.2002. On issuance of such\nGradation List and obtaining of promotion, on the basis of\nsuch Gradation List, whether the appellant could have\naltered seniority of the respondents the same is the question\nbegging answer for that the Rule 7(4) was in existence at the\ntime when this Gradation List was prepared and also when\nthe promotion to the respondents was granted. Neither\nchallenge either to the Gradation List was made by any\nperson nor any challenge was made to the promotion granted\nto the respondents. The Gradation List appears to be the\nbasic document on the basis of which further career\ndetermination of the respondents had to be made and on the\nbasis they have already been granted promotion as Deputy\nCollector (BS-18) and subsequently, and by after-thought,\nchange of seniority list separately is not tenable and the\nTribunal in this respondents has dealt with the matter\nelaborately and decided the same in which we find no\nillegality challenge for interference. The appeals are\ntherefore, allowed in above terms.”\n\nCivil Petition No. 1002 of 2025 7\n\n7. From perusal of hereinabove conclusions made by this\nCourt in the above case, it appears that all the factual and legal\npoints raised before the Federal Service Tribunal and before this\nCourt in the earlier judgment dated 20.02.2019 in Civil Appeals No.\n1219 to 1222/2015 for determining the issue of seniority shall be\ndetermined at the time of induction in service and cannot be\nchanged subsequently, especially when the officers have been\n\npromoted to the next higher grade.\n\n8. The record of the instant case reveals that the issue with\nregard to seniority was decided by the FST not only in the case of\nrespondents but also subsequently in Civil Appeals No. 248 to\n251/2018 and the judgment is reportedly in the field. The revised\nseniority list dated 14.06.2022 under the facts and circumstances\nof this case shows that the same was issued in violation of the\njudgment of the FST as well as the judgment of this Court for the\nreason that reliance on the Rules 1990, was misplaced as\nrespondents were already promoted as per CSS merit list and their\nprobation period already stood completed. In view of hereinabove\nfacts and circumstances of the case, we are of the considered\nopinion that petitioner was not justified to cause any delay in the\nimplementation of the judgment of FST dated 30.07.2015 in the case\nof respondents, particularly when the legal issue involved in instant\ncase has already been affirmed by this Court in Civil Appeals No.\n248 to 251/2018 titled FBR though its Chairman, Islamabad_v.\nMuhammad_ Junaid Jalil Khan_and_others vide their order dated\n\n11.12.2019 in terms of para-2 as reproduced hereinabove.\n\n9. Learned counsel for the petitioner during course of\narguments, argued that the order dated 11.12.2019 was passed in\nthe case of some other Custom officers of 24th CTP, therefore, it\ncannot be applied in the case of respondents. Such contention of\nlearned counsel for petitioner is misconceived for the reasons that\nthe facts of instant case are similar to the facts in the case\nMuhammad Junaid Jalil Khan whereas, they were also aggrieved by\nthe same seniority list, the ratio of the above referred judgment also\nattracted in the instant case, for the reason that the said judgment\nwas in rem and in view of the large number of judgments of this\nCourt, the benefit of the judgment in rem can be extended to\n\nsimilarly placed parties. Reliance in this regard can be placed on the\n\nCivil Petition No. 1002 of 2025 8\n\ncase of Tara Chand_and_ others vs. Karachi Water and Sewerage\n\nBoard _and_others (2005 SCMR 499) wherein, it has been held as\n\nunder:\n\n“5...Though he is a_non-appealing party in the\naforementioned appeals, yet is entitled to the same relief on\nthe basis of principle of rule of equality...”\n\n“7,...argued that the judgment of this Court passed in the\naforesaid civil appeals was in fact judgment in personam\nand not in rem, as such, the petitioner and applicants are not\nentitled to any relief. According to them, this being a service\nmatter, they should have approached the Service Tribunal for\nredressal of their grievance which jurisdiction was not\ninvoked by them.”\n\n“8...Since the services of all of them were dispensed with by\nsingle order, as such, there is no distinction in between their\ncase and that of appellants and is identical on all fours.”\n\n“9, As to whether impugned judgment is ‘judgment in\npersonam' or judgment in rem', it would be appropriate to\nreproduce their definitions as defined in various dictionaries:\n\n(I) The Oxford Companion to Law by David _M. Walker\nJudgment in personam.--- A judgment determining the rights\nof B persons inter se in or to any money or property in\ndispute, but not affecting the status of persons or things or\ndetermining any interest in property except between the\nparties. They include all judgments for money. Rem,\nJudgment in.--- A legal determination binding not only the\nparties but all persons.

Aiyar's Judicial Dictionary (10th Edition 1988)\n\nNormally a judgment binds only those who are parties to it.\nSuch judgments are known as Judgments in personam.\nRem, Judgment in.--- A judgment which gives to the\nsuccessful party possession or declaration of some definite\nright which right is available against the whole world.\n\n(III) Words and Phrases legally defined (Vol. 3 I-N)\n\nJudgment, In personam.--- A judgment in personam or inter\nparties are those which determine the rights of parties inter\nse to or in the subject-matter in dispute, whether it be\ncorporeal property of any kind whatever or a liquidated or\nunliquidated demand, but do not affect the status of either\npersons or things, or make any disposition of property or\ndeclare or determine any interest in it except as between the\nparties litigant. They include all judgments which are not\njudgments in rem. A judgment in personam determines the\nrights of the parties inter se to or in the subject matter in\ndispute, whether it be corporeal property of any kind\nwhatever or a liquidated or unliquidated demand, but does\nnot affect the status of either persons or things, or make any\ndisposition of property, or declare or determine any interest\nin it except as between the parties litigant. Judgments in\npersonam include all judgments which are not judgments in\nrem, but as many judgments in the latter class deal with the\nstatus of persons and not of things, the description\n\"Judgment inter parties\" is preferable to ‘Judgment in\npersonam'. Judgment, In Rem.--- A judgment in rem may be\ndefined as the judgment of a Court of competent jurisdiction\ndetermining the status of a person or thing, or the disposition\nof a thing (as distinct from the particular interest in it of a\nparty to the litigation). Apart from the application of the term\nto persons, it must affect the res in the way of condemnation,\n\nCivil Petition No. 1002 of 2025 9\n\nforfeiture, declaration of status or title, or order for sale or\ntransfer.\n\n(IV) Black's Law Dictionary with pronunciations (6th Edition).\n\nJudgment in personam or inter parties.

Irrespective of above case laws, our Constitutional\nprovisions are also explicit. According to Article 25 of the\nConstitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, all\ncitizens are equal before law and are entitled to equal\nprotection of law.”\n\n10. Similarly, in the case of Hameed Akhtar Niazi vs. The\n\nSecretary, Establishment Division, Government of Pakistan _and\nothers (1996 SCMR 1185) upon which reliance has been rightly\nplaced by the FST, benefit was extended to all persons falling in the\nsame category in order to do complete justice where it was held as\n\nunder:\n\n“16. In our view, it will be just and proper to remand the case to the\nTribunal with the direction to re-examine the above case after notice to\nthe affected persons and to decide the same afresh in the light of above\nobservations. We may observe that if the Tribunal or this Court decides\na point of law relating to the terms of service of a civil servant which\ncovers not only the case of the civil servant who litigated, but also of\nother civil servants, who may have not taken any legal proceedings; in\nsuch a case, the dictates of justice and rule of good governance demand\nthat the benefit of the above judgment be extended to other civil servants,\nwho may not be parties to the above litigation instead of compelling them\nto approach the Tribunal or any other legal forum.”\n\n11.

Accordingly,\ninstant petition was dismissed vide our short order dated\n19.06.2025.

            "CleanedText": "JUDGMENT AQEEL AHMED ABBASI, J.- Through instant petition for leave to appeal the petitioner department has assailed the order dated 06.03.2025 passed by Federal Service Tribunal, Islamabad in Misc. Petition No. 258/2025 in Appeal No.460 R /2013. 2. Brief facts of the case are that the Respondent No.1 is an officer of Pakistan Customs Services hereinafter referred to as PCS who appeared for the CSS exam held in 1996 and was appointed in July 1998 as Assistant Collector BS-17 . The Respondent No. 1 belongs to the 25 Common Training Program hereinafter referred to as CTP and successfully completed the said training in July 1998 and Specialized Training Program STP in February 1999 and Final Passing Out Examination FPOE in her second attempt. The petitioner department-FBR established the 25th CTP seniority in accordance with the Rule 7 4 of the Occupational Group and Services Probation, Training and Seniority Rules, 1990 hereinafter referred to as Rules 1990 and issued a provisional seniority list in the year 2008 and final seniority list in 2012 Civil Petition No. 1002 of 2025 2 whereby, Respondent No. 1 was relegated to a lower position. She challenged the said seniority list before the Federal Service Tribunal hereinafter referred to as FST . The FST accepted the appeal of Respondent No. 1 together with connected appeals of the officers of 24th CTP and vide its judgment dated 30.07.2015 held that the Rules of 1990 could not have been made applicable to the officers after they had been promoted. The FST restored the seniority of Respondent No. 1 and set aside both the provisional seniority list issued in 2008 and the final seniority list issued in 2012. Ina parallel development four officers of PCS from the 24th CTP approached the FST to challenge the seniority list finalized by the petitioner department in 2012. The FST while relying upon its earlier judgment in the case of Respondent No. 1 dated 30.07.2015 allowed their appeals vide a judgment dated 05.01.2017. Respondent No.1 filed a writ petition before the Islamabad High Court seeking the implementation of the judgment dated 30.07.2015 passed by the FST in the appeal of Respondent No.1. However, the petitioner department being aggrieved of the judgment dated 30.07.2015 preferred Civil Appeals No. 1219 to 1222/2015 before this August Court and also preferred Civil Appeals No. 248 to 251/2018 against the judgment dated 05.01.2017 whereby, the benefit of the judgment dated 30.07.2015 was extended. This August Court passed a judgment dated 20.02.2019 in favour of the respondents and observed that it will hear the appeals filed by the petitioner department in case of Syed Shakeel Shah and others separately since distinct questions of law and facts were involved in those appeals. In the other set of appeals preferred by petitioner department against the judgment of FST dated 05.01.2017 wherein similar benefit to that of judgment dated 30.07.2015 was extended and adjudicated upon by this August Court on 11.12.2019 in favour of Respondent No.1. The petitioner department preferred reviews against judgments dated 20.02.2019 and 11.12.2019 which were both dismissed vide orders dated 20.09.2019 and 07.07.2020. Consequently, the FBR issued revised inter-se-seniority list on 14.06.2022, per Rules, 1990 unamended , in contrast to the Seniority List issued for 24th CTP Batch, seniority whereof, was restored to original, per CSS merit list. Respondent No. 1 being aggrieved of this preferred a representation dated 15.06.2022 before the FBR praying for restoration of her original seniority list per conjoined reading of judgment of this August Court in the case filed Civil Petition No. 1002 of 2025 3 by the FBR against her as well as in Civil Appeals No. 248 to 251/2018. The Respondent No.1 invoked the jurisdiction of Islamabad High Court under Article 187 by way of W.P. No. 2695/2023 which was allowed vide judgment dated 10.02.2025 by the learned Division Bench of the Islamabad High Court which remitted the matter to FST being the Executing Court. Upon remission the FST passed the order for implementation dated 06.03.2025 which has been assailed by way of instant CPLA by the petitioner department. 3. Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the legal regime governing the redressal of grievances of civil servants under the Service Tribunal Act, 1973 envisages a personal right of appeal and relief for each civil servant. Once a service matter is litigated up to the Supreme Court and attains finality, it binds the party to the outcome of that litigation to their extent. He contends that while passing the impugned order dated 06.03.2025 in execution proceedings that were initiated by the Respondent No. 1, FST has failed to properly appreciate and follow the order dated 20.02.2019 passed by this August Court in Civil Appeals No. 1219 to 1222/2015 related to the Respondent No. 1 and other officers of the 25th CTP which has already been implemented by FBR. He submits that the Respondent No. 1 has been rightly placed at Sr No.18 of the seniority list dated 21.12.2012 of BPS-18 which was reissued on 14.06.2022 in compliance of the above stated order of this court. Learned counsel contends that feeling aggrieved of her placement in the seniority list of BPS-18, the Respondent No.1 approached the FST again in execution proceedings and while granting relief to her vide impugned order dated 06.03.2025, FST has wrongly applied the order dated 11.12.2019 passed by this August Court in Civil Appeals No. 248 to 251/2018 to determine the seniority of Respondent No.1 whereas, the said order is related to the 24th CTP and not the 25 CTP to which the Respondent No.1 belongs. He submits that a decision passed in the case of one civil servant cannot be applied and executed by the FST in favour of another civil servant even if there is complete similarity in their cases unless a separate decision of FST on the same lines exists in the latter s case which is also upheld by the Supreme Court. He submits that in the presence of a final and binding judgment by the Supreme Court fixing seniority of the 25 CTP officers of PCS in a Civil Petition No. 1002 of 2025 4 particular manner on appeal from and by modifying a decision of FST passed in the service appeals, the said officers of 25t CTP cannot seek to fix their seniority afresh in a different manner under a subsequent judgment of the Supreme Court passed in the case of 24th CTP Officers. 4. Conversely, learned counsel for the Respondent No.1 contends that the issue of inter-se seniority between officers of 24th and 25th CTP of PCS has been in litigation since the revised seniority list was issued by FBR on 21.012.2012 so as to bring the inter-se seniority list in consonance with the amended 1990 Rules, as amended in 2001. He submits that the Respondent No. 1 was relegated to a lower position through the revised seniority list issued by the FBR, based on the amendments made to the Rules 1990, in 2001 which were applied retrospectively and to the prejudice of the Respondent No. 1 as she had already completed her probation and earned promotion in accordance with the CSS merit as held by the judgment given by the FST dated 30.07.2015. He further submits that the above referred judgment of the FST was implemented by the Islamabad High Court in W.P. No. 4545/2016 and subsequently, affirmed by this Hon ble Court vide judgments dated 20.02.2019 and 11.12.2019 in an identical matter i.e. in Muhammad Junaid Jalil Khan/24th CTP Case . Learned counsel contends that this Hon ble Court had endorsed the principle that once seniority has been determined and promotion is granted based on an earlier gradation list, any subsequent revision thereof, is not permissible. In a parallel set of litigation, the FST extended the same benefit to the 24 CTP officers as earlier granted by FST vide judgment dated 30.07.2015 to the Respondent No.1. The principle asserted in the case of the 24th CTP was the principle laid down in the case of Hameed Akhtar Niazi vs. Secretary Establishment 1996 SCMR 1185 which states that relief ought to have been uniformly applied to all similarly placed officers. He submits that while the seniority of 24th CTP officers was revised in accordance with the CSS merit list by issuance of revised list on 14.06.2022 but yet the Respondent No.1 belonging to the 25th CTP was discriminatorily excluded, notwithstanding the admitted similar facts, circumstances and legal context. He further submits that the petitioner department-FBR s issuance of revised seniority list was in contradiction to the advice of both Law and Justice Division and Establishment Division. Civil Petition No. 1002 of 2025 5 Learned counsel contends that FBR filed review claiming both the judgments of 24th and 25th CTP are contradictory to one another as they do not have the same set of facts and circumstances, but both reviews were dismissed. Learned counsel contends that the Respondent No.1 filed a writ petition before the Islamabad High Court under Article 187 of the Constitution which was allowed vide judgment dated 10.02.2025 but the matter was remitted to FST being the executing court. While concluding his arguments the learned counsel for the Respondent No. 1 has submitted that despite the fact that the legal issue involved in the instant matter has been decided in favour of the respondents up to the Hon ble Supreme Court, however, since the petitioner in total disregard of such orders were not complying with the said orders therefore, Respondent No.1 was constrained to file implementation application before the FST, who has been pleased to pass the impugned order which is unexceptional, therefore, instant CPLA being devoid of any merits may be dismissed. 5. We have heard the learned counsel for both the parties and perused the impugned order as well as the record of the case. Instant petition for leave to appeal arises from an order dated 06.03.2025 passed by the FST in Misc. Petition No. 258 259/2025 in Service Appeal No.460 R /2013 in the case of Mst. Naureen Ahmad Tarar vs. FBR. It is pertinent to note that subject Misc. Petition was remitted from Islamabad High Court vide order dated 10.02.2025 while holding that in view of Section 5 3 of the Services Tribunals Act, 1973 it can execute its own decisions, the respondents were seeking implementation of the order of FST passed in Service Appeals No. 460 461 R CS/2013 wherein, the respondents had challenged the final seniority list for the year 2008 which was issued in the year 2012, the appeals were allowed and seniority list issued on 21.12.2012 was set aside vide judgment dated 26.03.2013. The petitioner has assailed the aforesaid judgment by filing a Civil Appeals No. 1219 to 1222/2015 before this Court which were decided on 20.02.2019 in the following terms. 12. Asa result, we hold that the 1990 Rules in their unamended form as at the commencement of the probationary period in July, 1998 shall remain applicable for reckoning the seniority of the private respondents on the completion of their probation in BS-17. The judgment of the learned Service Tribunal is accordingly modified to the foregoing extent. The observations made by the learned Service Tribunal about the workability of the 1990 Rules Civil Petition No. 1002 of 2025 6 post the 2001 amendment are endorsed and for this purpose, the Federal Government needs to apply its mind to remove the salient anomalies highlighted by the learned Service Tribunal that exist in the application and implementation of the said rules. These appeals are partially allowed in above terms. 6. It is pertinent to mention that the appeals of Syed Shakeel Shah and others seeking similar relief were allowed by the FST vide order dated 05.01.2017 with directions to the petitioner department to consider their cases at par with the case of Mst. Naureen Akhtar Tarar and others. The above said judgment was assailed before this Court by filing Civil Appeals No. 1219 to 1222/2015, however, the same could not be decided on the grounds that separate questions of law and facts are involved therein. The respondents, thereafter, sought implementation of the order of this Court dated 11.12.2019 in Civil Appeals No. 248 to 251/2018, the operative part of which has been reproduced by the FST in the impugned order to clarify its applicability on the facts and circumstances of instant case. 2. We have asked the learned Br. ASC for the appellant to distinguish or show inapplicability of the order of this Court dated 20.02.2019 to the present case, the learned Sr. ASC has referred to the provision of Rule 7 4 of the Occupational Groups Services Probation, Training and Seniority Rules 1990, as they stood originally before amendment made in the year 2001, to contend that Final Passing out Examination was to be passed in the first attempt for determination of the inter-se seniority of the probationers and the respondents having passed the said examinations in second attempt, their seniority will be determined on that basis in that they will become juniors to those who passed the said examination in the first attempt. Though such plea has been raised before us by the learned Sr. ASC but we note that the probationary periods of all the respondents were terminated on 03.03.2000 and on the basis of Gradation List prepared by the appellant itself on 31.12.1998, the respondents were granted promotion as Deputy Collector BS-18 on 19.03.2002. On issuance of such Gradation List and obtaining of promotion, on the basis of such Gradation List, whether the appellant could have altered seniority of the respondents the same is the question begging answer for that the Rule 7 4 was in existence at the time when this Gradation List was prepared and also when the promotion to the respondents was granted. Neither challenge either to the Gradation List was made by any person nor any challenge was made to the promotion granted to the respondents. The Gradation List appears to be the basic document on the basis of which further career determination of the respondents had to be made and on the basis they have already been granted promotion as Deputy Collector BS-18 and subsequently, and by after-thought, change of seniority list separately is not tenable and the Tribunal in this respondents has dealt with the matter elaborately and decided the same in which we find no illegality challenge for interference. The appeals are therefore, allowed in above terms. Civil Petition No. 1002 of 2025 7 7. From perusal of hereinabove conclusions made by this Court in the above case, it appears that all the factual and legal points raised before the Federal Service Tribunal and before this Court in the earlier judgment dated 20.02.2019 in Civil Appeals No. 1219 to 1222/2015 for determining the issue of seniority shall be determined at the time of induction in service and cannot be changed subsequently, especially when the officers have been promoted to the next higher grade. 8. The record of the instant case reveals that the issue with regard to seniority was decided by the FST not only in the case of respondents but also subsequently in Civil Appeals No. 248 to 251/2018 and the judgment is reportedly in the field. The revised seniority list dated 14.06.2022 under the facts and circumstances of this case shows that the same was issued in violation of the judgment of the FST as well as the judgment of this Court for the reason that reliance on the Rules 1990, was misplaced as respondents were already promoted as per CSS merit list and their probation period already stood completed. In view of hereinabove facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the considered opinion that petitioner was not justified to cause any delay in the implementation of the judgment of FST dated 30.07.2015 in the case of respondents, particularly when the legal issue involved in instant case has already been affirmed by this Court in Civil Appeals No. 248 to 251/2018 titled FBR though its Chairman, Islamabad v. Muhammad Junaid Jalil Khan and others vide their order dated 11.12.2019 in terms of para-2 as reproduced hereinabove. 9. Learned counsel for the petitioner during course of arguments, argued that the order dated 11.12.2019 was passed in the case of some other Custom officers of 24th CTP, therefore, it cannot be applied in the case of respondents. Such contention of learned counsel for petitioner is misconceived for the reasons that the facts of instant case are similar to the facts in the case Muhammad Junaid Jalil Khan whereas, they were also aggrieved by the same seniority list, the ratio of the above referred judgment also attracted in the instant case, for the reason that the said judgment was in rem and in view of the large number of judgments of this Court, the benefit of the judgment in rem can be extended to similarly placed parties. Reliance in this regard can be placed on the Civil Petition No. 1002 of 2025 8 case of Tara Chand and others vs. Karachi Water and Sewerage Board and others 2005 SCMR 499 wherein, it has been held as under: 5...Though he is a non-appealing party in the aforementioned appeals, yet is entitled to the same relief on the basis of principle of rule of equality... 7,...argued that the judgment of this Court passed in the aforesaid civil appeals was in fact judgment in personam and not in rem, as such, the petitioner and applicants are not entitled to any relief. According to them, this being a service matter, they should have approached the Service Tribunal for redressal of their grievance which jurisdiction was not invoked by them. 8...Since the services of all of them were dispensed with by single order, as such, there is no distinction in between their case and that of appellants and is identical on all fours. 9, As to whether impugned judgment is judgment in personam or judgment in rem , it would be appropriate to reproduce their definitions as defined in various dictionaries: I The Oxford Companion to Law by David M. Walker Judgment in personam.--- A judgment determining the rights of B persons inter se in or to any money or property in dispute, but not affecting the status of persons or things or determining any interest in property except between the parties. They include all judgments for money. Rem, Judgment in.--- A legal determination binding not only the parties but all persons. It applies particularly to judgments in Admiralty, declaring the status of a ship, matrimonial causes, grants of probate and administration and condemnation of goods by a competent Court. i K .J. Aiyar s Judicial Dictionary 10th Edition 1988 Normally a judgment binds only those who are parties to it. Such judgments are known as Judgments in personam. Rem, Judgment in.--- A judgment which gives to the successful party possession or declaration of some definite right which right is available against the whole world. III Words and Phrases legally defined Vol. 3 I-N Judgment, In personam.--- A judgment in personam or inter parties are those which determine the rights of parties inter se to or in the subject-matter in dispute, whether it be corporeal property of any kind whatever or a liquidated or unliquidated demand, but do not affect the status of either persons or things, or make any disposition of property or declare or determine any interest in it except as between the parties litigant. They include all judgments which are not judgments in rem. A judgment in personam determines the rights of the parties inter se to or in the subject matter in dispute, whether it be corporeal property of any kind whatever or a liquidated or unliquidated demand, but does not affect the status of either persons or things, or make any disposition of property, or declare or determine any interest in it except as between the parties litigant. Judgments in personam include all judgments which are not judgments in rem, but as many judgments in the latter class deal with the status of persons and not of things, the description Judgment inter parties is preferable to Judgment in personam . Judgment, In Rem.--- A judgment in rem may be defined as the judgment of a Court of competent jurisdiction determining the status of a person or thing, or the disposition of a thing as distinct from the particular interest in it of a party to the litigation . Apart from the application of the term to persons, it must affect the res in the way of condemnation, Civil Petition No. 1002 of 2025 9 forfeiture, declaration of status or title, or order for sale or transfer. IV Black s Law Dictionary with pronunciations 6th Edition . Judgment in personam or inter parties. A judgment against a particular person, as distinguished from a judgment against a thing or a right or status. Judgment in rem. An adjudication pronounced upon the status of some particular thing or subject-matter, by a Tribunal, having competent authority. Booth v. Copley, 238 Ky.23, 140 S.W 2d, 62, 666. It is founded on a proceeding instituted against or on something or subject-matter whose status or condition is to be determined. Eureka Building and Iran Assn v. Shultz, 139E Kan, 435, 32 P.2d 477, 480; or one brought to enforce a right in the thing itself. Federal Land Bank of Omaha v. Jafferson, 229 Iowa 1054, 295 N.W. 855, 857. It operates upon the property, Guild v. Walis, 150 Or. 69, 40 P. 2nd 747, 742. It is a solemn declaration for the status of some person or thing. Jones v. Teat, Tex Civ. Appellant. 57 S.W. 2d. 617, 620. It is binding upon all persons in so far as their interests in the property are concerned. 11. Irrespective of above case laws, our Constitutional provisions are also explicit. According to Article 25 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, all citizens are equal before law and are entitled to equal protection of law. 10. Similarly, in the case of Hameed Akhtar Niazi vs. The Secretary, Establishment Division, Government of Pakistan and others 1996 SCMR 1185 upon which reliance has been rightly placed by the FST, benefit was extended to all persons falling in the same category in order to do complete justice where it was held as under: 16. In our view, it will be just and proper to remand the case to the Tribunal with the direction to re-examine the above case after notice to the affected persons and to decide the same afresh in the light of above observations. We may observe that if the Tribunal or this Court decides a point of law relating to the terms of service of a civil servant which covers not only the case of the civil servant who litigated, but also of other civil servants, who may have not taken any legal proceedings; in such a case, the dictates of justice and rule of good governance demand that the benefit of the above judgment be extended to other civil servants, who may not be parties to the above litigation instead of compelling them to approach the Tribunal or any other legal forum. 11. The above view was reiterated by this Court in the case of Khawaja Abdul Hameed Nasir and others vs. National Bank of Pakistan and others 2003 SCMR 1030 , in the case of Government of Punjab, though Secretary Education, Civil Secretariat, Lahore and others vs. Sameena Parveen and others 2009 SCMR 1 and in the case of WAPDA through Chairman and others vs. Abdul Ghaffar and others 2018 SCMR 380 . 12. In view of the hereinabove facts and circumstances of this case, we do not find any error or illegality in the impugned order Civil Petition No. 1002 of 2025 10 passed by the FST and this petition does not raise a substantial question of law of public importance and warrant no interference by this court within the contemplation of Article 212 3 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. Accordingly, instant petition was dismissed vide our short order dated 19.06.2025. Above are the reasons of such short order, which reads as under: For the reasons to be recorded, this petition is dismissed.

                "Such contention of learned counsel for petitioner is misconceived for the reasons that the facts of instant case are similar to the facts in the case Muhammad Junaid Jalil Khan whereas, they were also aggrieved by the same seniority list, the ratio of the above referred judgment also attracted in the instant case, for the reason that the said judgment was in rem and in view of the large number of judgments of this Court, the benefit of the judgment in rem can be extended to similarly placed parties.",

Misc. BA No. 1746-P/ 2025)\n\nSahad .... Petitioner\nVersus\n\nMst. Afsheen and another .... Respondents\n\nFor the Petitioner : Mr. M. Amjad Iqbal Qureshi, ASC\n\nMr. Shanzeb Khan, ASC\n\nFor the State : Mr. Altaf Khan, Addl. AG KPK\na/w Paseel Khan, DSP\n& Nomair Khan, Inspector\n\nFor the Complainant : Mr. Abid Ali, ASC\nDate of Hearing : 18.08.2025\nJUDGMENT\n\nSyed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, J.- Through this Criminal Petition for\n\nLeave to Appeal, the Petitioner has called in question the Order\ndated 20.06.2025 [Impugned Order’] passed by the Peshawar\nHigh Court at Peshawar in Criminal Miscellaneous Bail\nApplication No. 1746-P of 2025 whereby the High Court, while\nupholding the Order dated 15.05.2025 passed by the learned\nAdditional Sessions Judge-IV, Swabi, declined bail to the\nPetitioner as well as his co-accused, Shahid. The proceedings\narose out of an FIR No. 501 of 2025 [instant FIR’), registered at\nPolice Station, Swabi on 04.04.2025 at 10:00 AM, against the\nPetitioner, accused Shahid and Basit, alleging offence under\n\nSections 302 and 34 of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860.\n\n2. The brief facts of the case as alleged in the instant FIR are\nthat on 03.04.2025 at 23:20 hours, Abu Bakar [‘the Deceased’,\naged 15/16 years, was allegedly taken by the accused Basit to\nthe Petitioner and accused Shahid. It is alleged that all three\n\naccused, armed with firearms, proceeded towards’ the\n\nCriminal Petition No. 1033 of 2025 -2-\n\nthoroughfare near Masjid Qasim Khel where, owing to a family\nproperty dispute, they opened fire upon the Deceased with the\ncommon intention to commit qgatl-i-camd. The Complainant, who\nwas present at the site and claims to have witnessed the\nincident under the bulb light, shifted the Deceased to DHQ\nHospital, Swabi and subsequently lodged the instant FIR,\nnominating the three accused, including the present Petitioner,\nfor the murder of the Deceased. During the said occurrence\naccused Basit sustained a firearm injury for which a cross-\nversion report was lodged vide DD No. 16 of even date pertaining\n\nto the instant FIR.\n\n3. Accused Basit was granted bail by the learned Additional\nSessions Judge-V, Swabi vide Order dated 22.04.2025. The\nPetitioner along with accused Shahid moved a bail application\nbefore the learned Additional Sessions Judge-IV, Swabi, which\nwas dismissed on 15.05.2025. Subsequently, on 19.05.2025,\nthe Petitioner and accused Shahid again filed a bail application\nbefore the learned Additional Sessions Judge-V, Swabi, which\ntoo was dismissed vide Order dated 24.05.2025. Being\naggrieved, the Petitioner and accused Shahid filed bail\napplication before the Peshawar High Court at Peshawar which\nalso met with the fate of dismissal vide Order dated 20.06.2025,\nculminating in the Impugned Order now under challenge before\n\nthis Court.\n\n4. Learned counsel for the Petitioner contends that the\nComplainant has attributed a generalized allegation of firing to\nall three accused persons without specification of weapons or\ntheir individual roles. It is urged by the learned counsel that the\nComplainant is the only eyewitness of the occurrence and the\nPetitioner has been falsely implicated with mala fide intention;\nthat one of the co-accused Basit having same role in the FIR has\nalready been enlarged on bail; that the prosecution story suffers\nfrom material contradictions and that the allegation of\nindiscriminate firing leaves the actual assailant yet to be\n\nidentified by the prosecution.\n\nCriminal Petition No. 1033 of 2025 -3-\n\n5. The learned Law Officer, assisted by the learned counsel\nfor the Complainant, submits that all three accused persons\nwere specifically nominated in the instant FIR with a direct\nallegation of firing upon the Deceased. It is argued that while the\ninstant FIR was lodged on 04.04.2025, the Petitioner was\narrested on 15.05.2025, and shortly thereafter, on 17.05.2025,\nthe weapon allegedly used in the offence was _ recovered.\nRecovery of weapon directly connects the Petitioner with the\ncommission of the offence. It is further submitted by the\nComplainant’s counsel that the case of accused Basit, who was\nadmitted to bail earlier, stands on a different footing as no\nrecovery was affected from him. The learned counsel also\nemphasizes that the Complainant being the mother of the\nDeceased personally witnessed the occurrence. Lastly, it is\nurged that the incident arose out of a protracted family property\ndispute and culminated in the brutal murder of a minor son of\nthe Complainant, which by its gravity disentitles the Petitioner\n\nfrom the concession of bail.\n\n6. Upon a query by the Court from the learned Law Officer\nregarding report of the Forensic Science Laboratory [‘FSL’] qua\nweapon allegedly recovered from the Petitioner, the learned Law\nOfficer initially submitted that the report was found negative.\nThe learned Law Officer placed on record a photocopy of the FSL\nreport which confirmed that the crime empties recovered from\nthe place of occurrence do not match with the weapon allegedly\n\nrecovered from the Petitioner.\n\n7. Arguments heard. Record perused. Admittedly, three\npersons have been charged by the Complainant for committing\nthe murder of her deceased son by attributing generalized role of\nfiring to all of them without specification of the firearm or the\nperson who fired such gunshots. A cross-version has also been\n\nlodged by accused Basit who allegedly sustained gunshots.\n\n8. On a tentative assessment of the material available on the\nrecord, particularly the FSL report referred to and photocopy\nwhereof was produced by the learned Law Officer, it appears\n\nthat the crime empties recovered from the place of occurrence do\n\nCriminal Petition No. 1033 of 2025 -4.\n\nnot match with the weapon allegedly recovered from the present\nPetitioner. The inconsistency between the recovered crime\nempties and the weapon attributed to the Petitioner renders the\nrecovery doubtful, all the more so as the said report, when\nproduced by the learned Law Officer, was neither objected to nor\ndenied by the learned counsel for the Complainant. Any opinion\nregarding the evidentiary value of such recovery, therefore,\ncannot be formed without recording evidence at the trial. It is\nalso pertinent to observe that the Complainant, who is the sole\neyewitness, did not specify in her statement the distinct role\nplayed by each of the accused. Her narration was general in\nnature, attributing no specific or individual role to the Petitioner\nwhich makes the case fit for further inquiry. In view whereof, we\nare of the considered opinion that the case of the Petitioner\nsquarely falls within the ambit of section 497(2), Cr.P.C. thereby\nentitling him to the concession of bail on the ground of further\n\ninquiry into his guilt.\n\n9. For the above reasons, this Petition is converted into an\nappeal and allowed. The Impugned Order of the High Court\ndated 20.06.2025 is set aside and the Petitioner is admitted to\npost-arrest bail subject to furnishing bail bonds in the sum of\nRs. 200,000/- (two lacs only) with one surety in the like amount\n\nto the satisfaction of the trial court.\n\n10. Before parting, it is reiterated that the observations made\nhereinabove are tentative in nature. The trial court is at liberty\nto independently adjudicate the case on its own merits, without\n\nbeing influenced by the observations made hereinabove.\n\nJudge\n\nJudge\nIslamabad\n18.08.2025\nAPPROVED FOR REPORTING\nYounus Shaikh, LC",

                "The learned Law Officer, assisted by the learned counsel for the Complainant, submits that all three accused persons were specifically nominated in the instant FIR with a direct allegation of firing upon the Deceased.",
                "It is argued that while the instant FIR was lodged on 04.04.2025, the Petitioner was arrested on 15.05.2025, and shortly thereafter, on 17.05.2025, the weapon allegedly used in the offence was recovered.",
                "Recovery of weapon directly connects the Petitioner with the commission of the offence.",
                "It is further submitted by the Complainant s counsel that the case of accused Basit, who was admitted to bail earlier, stands on a different footing as no recovery was affected from him.",
                "The learned counsel also emphasizes that the Complainant being the mother of the Deceased personally witnessed the occurrence.",
                "Lastly, it is urged that the incident arose out of a protracted family property dispute and culminated in the brutal murder of a minor son of the Complainant, which by its gravity disentitles the Petitioner from the concession of bail.",
                "Upon a query by the Court from the learned Law Officer regarding report of the Forensic Science Laboratory FSL qua weapon allegedly recovered from the Petitioner, the learned Law Officer initially submitted that the report was found negative.",
                "The learned Law Officer placed on record a photocopy of the FSL report which confirmed that the crime empties recovered from the place of occurrence do not match with the weapon allegedly recovered from the Petitioner.",
                "Admittedly, three persons have been charged by the Complainant for committing the murder of her deceased son by attributing generalized role of firing to all of them without specification of the firearm or the person who fired such gunshots.",
                "A cross-version has also been lodged by accused Basit who allegedly sustained gunshots.",
                "On a tentative assessment of the material available on the record, particularly the FSL report referred to and photocopy whereof was produced by the learned Law Officer, it appears that the crime empties recovered from the place of occurrence do Criminal Petition No. 1033 of 2025 -4. not match with the weapon allegedly recovered from the present Petitioner.",
                "The inconsistency between the recovered crime empties and the weapon attributed to the Petitioner renders the recovery doubtful, all the more so as the said report, when produced by the learned Law Officer, was neither objected to nor denied by the learned counsel for the Complainant.",
                "Any opinion regarding the evidentiary value of such recovery, therefore, cannot be formed without recording evidence at the trial.",
                "It is also pertinent to observe that the Complainant, who is the sole eyewitness, did not specify in her statement the distinct role played by each of the accused.",
                "Her narration was general in nature, attributing no specific or individual role to the Petitioner which makes the case fit for further inquiry.",
                "In view whereof, we are of the considered opinion that the case of the Petitioner squarely falls within the ambit of section 497 2 , Cr.P.C.",
                "thereby entitling him to the concession of bail on the ground of further inquiry into his guilt.",
                "For the above reasons, this Petition is converted into an appeal and allowed.",
                "The Impugned Order of the High Court dated 20.06.2025 is set aside and the Petitioner is admitted to post-arrest bail subject to furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs. 200,000/- two lacs only with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court. 10.",
                "Before parting, it is reiterated that the observations made hereinabove are tentative in nature.",
                "The trial court is at liberty to independently adjudicate the case on its own merits, without being influenced by the observations made hereinabove.",

CPLA Nos.373-K to 386-K, 424-K to 432-K, 55-K of 2025: These\n\npetitions are barred by time and condonation applications are already\non record. Since other connected petitions are within time, therefore,\ntaking into consideration the grounds raised for condonation, the\n\napplications are allowed and delay is condoned.\n\n3. The short-lived facts of the case are that the respondents had filed\nindividual/separate Constitution Petitions under Article 199 of the\nConstitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973\n(“Constitution”) in the High Court of Sindh, Bench at Sukkur,\nwherein they sought directions against the respondents/ petitioners to\nallow them to join service on non-technical vacancies ranging from\nBPS-01 to BPS-04 in view of the recommendations and offer letters\nissued to them by the District Recruitment Committee (“DRC”). They\nalso prayed for directions against the petitioners to start the payment\nof salary in terms of the order dated 18.09.2024 passed by the High\nCourt in CP No.D-1435/2023. It is further alleged that the\nrespondents, pursuant to an advertisement published in the\nnewspaper for various posts of BPS-01 to BPS-04, applied in the\nEducation & Literacy Department for recruitment through walk-in-\ninterviews. The interviews were conducted by the DRC and the\nrespondents were issued offer letters. According to the petitioners,\nthrough two separate orders, both dated 03.05.2023, in other\nconstitution petitions, bearing CP No.D-424 of 2019 and CP No.124 of\n\nCPLA 4-K/2025, etc. -6-\n\n2023, filed before the High Court, having similar grievance, were\ndisposed of by the High Court with the directions to the\npetitioners/respondents to appear in the next recruitment process as\nnotified in the Notification dated 03.03.2020 and the policy guidelines\ndated 26.04.2023 laid down for the DRCs constituted under Rule 5 (1)\nof the Sindh Civil Servants (Appointments, Promotion & Transfer)\nRules, 1974, with further direction to fill all posts in future as per the\nsaid guidelines. However, in the present situation, the grievance of the\npetitioners is that the High Court, while relying on the order dated\n18.09.2024 passed in CP No.D-1435/2023 and order dated\n19.09.2024 passed in CP No.D-983/2024, decided all the\nConstitution Petitions in favour of the respondents without providing\nample opportunity of hearing and submitting the\ncomments/documents in all cases, and without even considering the\nfact that the recruitment process was initiated through different\nadvertisements and terms and conditions that could not be treated at\n\npar.\n\n4. Mr. Jawad Dero, learned Advocate General, Sindh (“AG”) with the\nassistance of Mr. Sibtain Mehmood, learned Additional Advocate\nGeneral, Sindh (“AAG”), argued that there were certain disputed\nquestions of facts which could not be decided in the writ jurisdiction,\nand without appreciating this crucial aspect, directions were issued\nfor accommodating the respondents/petitioners. It was further\ncontended that recruitment under the Sindh Civil Servants\n(Appointment, Promotion & Transfer) Rules, 1974, cannot be claimed\nas a vested right and without approval of the competent authority.\nThe recommendation of the DRC could not create a right to claim\nlegitimate expectancy. It was further avowed that in the impugned\norder, there is a reference of the order passed by the High Court in\nC.P. No.D-1435 of 2023, and according to him, the present cases have\nno nexus with such order for the reason that the appointments\ninvolved in that petition were based on advertisements published in\n2021 for different posts in the Department of Empowerment of\nPersons with Disabilities from Grades 1 to 4, whereas the present\nimpugned order is germane to the advertisement published between\n2021-2022 on different dates, for various posts in multiple\ndepartments of the Government of Sindh, from Grades 1 to 4. In order\nto place proper facts before the High Court, the departments prayed\n\nfor time to file comments, which request was turned down by the\n\nCPLA 4-K/2025, ete. 7.\n\nlearned Division Bench, and the order passed earlier in C.P. No.D-\n1435 of 2023 was applied mutatis mutandis to all subsequent\n\npetitions.\n\n5. The learned counsel appearing for the respondents did not deny\nthat different advertisements were involved in the recruitment\nprocess, but they further argued that their appointments were made\non recommendations of the DRC and the appointment letters were\nissued after proper deliberation and some of the\nrespondents/petitioners were even allowed to join and they also\nserved the department, but subsequently, they were removed from\ntheir service without following due process which is a grave violation\n\nof Article 10-A of the Constitution.\n\n6. Heard the arguments. For ease of convenience, the impugned order\nis reproduced as under (the pith and substance of the impugned\norders is one and the same in all civil petitions, with variation in\n\ndates):\n\n“12.11.2024.\n\nM/s. Noor Muhammad Soomro, Mehboob Ali Wassan,\nWagar Ali Phulpoto, and Aamir Ali Bhutto, Advocates for\npetitioners.\n\n1. Urgency granted.\n\n2&3. Mr. Zulfiqar Ali Naich, Assistant A.G present in\nCourt waives notice of these petitions. While learned\ncounsel for the petitioners are of the view that all these\npetitions could be decided in terms of detailed order dated\n18.09.2024 passed by this Court in CP No.D-1435 of\n2023, and whereas in another bunch benefit of the said\norder was directed to apply those bunch of petitions in\nmutatis mutandis. Counsel for the petitioner’s state that\nsame treatment could have been met out to the\npetitioners.\n\nHowever, learned AAG states that let in the first instance\ncomments of the respondents be filed. As this Court has\nalready allowed such petition, we do not see any merit in\nsuch a request in these circumstances. Accordingly, these\npetitions along with pending application(s) are thus\ndisposed of in the same manner mode and mechanism as\nadopted in CP No.D-1435 of 2023, which order to apply\nmutatis mutandis to the instant petitions.\n\nOffice is directed to place a signed copy of this order in\nthe captioned connected matters.” [Emphasis supplied]\n\nCPLA 4-K/2025, etc. -8-\n\n7. No doubt, when a controversy regarding appointment or\nrecruitment process is triggered, the High Court, in the writ\njurisdiction, cannot record evidence and cannot be involved deeply in\nthe factual controversy, which cannot be thrashed out without leading\nevidence by the parties. However, at the same time, the available\nrecord and the comments filed by the concerned department can be\nvetted and scanned in order to arrive at a just conclusion on whether\nthe matter can be adjudicated upon based on the available and\nadmitted documents without dilating upon the factual controversy. In\n\nthe case of Special Secretary-II (Law & Order), Home & Tribal Affairs\n\nDepartment, Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar Vs.\n\nFayyaz Dawar (2023 SCMR 1442 = 2023 SCP 199), one of us,\n\nspeaking for the bench, held that in the constitutional jurisdiction,\nthe High Court cannot go into miniature and diminutive facts because\nthe extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution\npredominantly envisions affording an express remedy where the\nunlawfulness and impropriety of the action of an executive or other\ngovernmental authority can be substantiated without any convoluted\ninquiry. The expression “adequate remedy” signifies an effectual,\naccessible, advantageous, and expeditious remedy. The object of\nproceedings under Article 199 of the Constitution, and the\nextraordinary jurisdiction it grants, is intended primarily for\nproviding an expeditious remedy in a case where the illegality of the\nimpugned action of an executive or other authority can be\nestablished without any elaborate enquiry into complicated or\ndisputed facts. In the case of Dr. Sher Afgan Khan Niazi Vs. Ali S.\nHabib & others (2011 SCMR 1813), this Court intensely conversed\n\nthe prerequisites and touchstone of the jurisdiction conferred upon\nthe High Courts under Article 199 of the Constitution and held that\nthe question of adequate or alternate remedy has been discussed\ntime and again by this Court and it is well settled by now that the\nwords \"adequate remedy\" connote an efficacious, convenient,\nbeneficial, effective, and speedy remedy. It should be equally\ninexpensive and expeditious. To effectively bar the jurisdiction of\nthe High Court under this Article the remedy available under the\nlaw must be able to accomplish the purpose which is sought to be\nachieved through a petition under Article 199. The other remedy in\norder to be adequate, must be equally convenient, beneficial, and\n\neffective, and the relief afforded by ordinary law must not be less\n\nCPLA 4-K/2025, etc. -9-\n\nefficacious, more expensive, and cumbersome to achieve as\n\ncompared to that provided under the Article.\n\n8. The expression “mutatis mutandis’ is a medieval Latin phrase\n\nwhich denotes \"with things changed that should be changed\" or \"once\n\nthe necessary changes have been made\", which cannot be muddled or\n\nintertwined with the phrase “ceteris paribus”, which prohibits and\nbars the changes other than those that are perceptibly articulated. In\nlegal parlance, the expression mutatis mutandis generally applies for\nmaking certain adjustments of features in a new situation or\nframework, as a shortcut (an alternative route that is shorter than the\none usually taken) in order to avoid reiterating or retelling the same\nprovisions with minor variations. It applies from one case to another\nwith required alterations or modifications within the different set of\ncircumstances of the cases to avoid repetition, by signifying that the\nprimary criterions shall apply with certain vicissitudes. The\nexpression “mutatis mutandis” is defined in various lexicons as\nunder:-\ne Black’s Law Dictionary (Revised 4th Edition, 1968; West Publishing\nCo.) Defines mutatis mutandis as “with the necessary changes in point\n\nof detail, meaning that matters or things are generally the same, but to\nbe altered when necessary as to names, offices, and the like”\n\ne Jowitt’s Dictionary of English Law (1st Edition, 1959; Sweet &\nMaxwell). Lists mutatis mutandis as a Latin phrase meaning “with the\nnecessary changes in points of detail”\n\ne Oxford Dictionary of Law (Sth Edition, 2003; Oxford University\nPress). Explains mutatis mutandis to mean “by changing what needs to\nbe changed,” indicating that one thing shall apply to another after\nmaking the necessary alterations.\n\ne Bouvier’s Law Dictionary (3rd Revision, 1914; Boston) — Similarly\ndefines mutatis mutandis in substance as “the necessary changes [being\nmade].”\n\ne Oxford English Dictionary (3rd Edition, 2003; Oxford University\nPress) — The OED records mutatis mutandis is an adverb meaning “with\nthe necessary changes having been made.” (Literally in Medieval Latin:\n“those things having been changed which need to be changed.”)\n\ne Cambridge English Dictionary (Cambridge University Press)\nDefines mutatis mutandis as “used when comparing two or more things\nto say that although changes will be necessary in order to take account\nof different situations, the basic point remains the same”\n\ne Collins English Dictionary (via Dictionary.com, 2012 Edition) -\nProvides a concise definition: “the necessary changes having been made”\n\n9. In the case of Muhammad Sharif Vs. The State (PLD 1999 SC\n\n1063), this Court adopted the view that mutatis mutandis “connotes\n\n29\n\n‘those changes being made which must be made” when applying one\n\nCPLA 4-K/2025, etc. -10-\n\nprovision to another situation. In short, in Pakistani jurisprudence\nthe term is understood as directing that a referenced law or principle\nshall apply after making whatever alterations are needed so that it fits\nthe new circumstance, but without changing its essential nature.\nWhereas the Supreme Court of India, in Vasudev Anant Kulkarni v.\n\nExecutive Engineer (1995 ACJ 97) observed that “the word ‘mutatis\n\nmutandis’ means with the appropriate alterations being made,”\nemphasizing that some modification is required —- “not ‘with such\nchanges as may be necessary’ but rather ‘with the necessary\n\n29\n\nadjustments being made’”. Earlier, in Ashok Service Centre v. State of\n\nOrissa (1983 2 SCR 363), the Court explained that extending an\n\nearlier Act to a later Act mutatis mutandis “brings in the idea of\nadaptation, but only so far as is necessary for the purpose, making a\nchange without altering the essential nature of the thing changed”.\nWhile the Supreme Court of Canada has succinctly defined In R. v.\nGauthier ([1977] 1 SCR 441), that “mutatis mutandis means making\n\nall necessary changes, but necessary changes only.”\n\n10. The main grievance of the petitioners is that without being\nprovided an opportunity of filing comments and an ample\nopportunity of hearing, the impugned order was passed when the\nmatter was fixed in the High Court at urgent motion. While they do\nnot disagree that the appointment/offer letters were issued to the\nrespondents, but according to them the appointment/offer letters\nwere issued without fulfilling the codal formalities, and if ample\nopportunity was provided by the High Court, they could have placed\non record all relevant material and could have also distinguished the\nterms and conditions of advertisements published for recruitment\nunder different time periods, which were not one and the same for all\nrecruitment processes. However, without providing any opportunity to\nfile comments or rebut the contention of the respondents before the\nHigh Court, the petitions were disposed of in a slipshod manner in\nterms of its earlier order in C.P. No.D-1435 of 2023 which was applied\nmutatis mutandis. Seemingly, the learned High Court, without\nappreciating or adverting to the facts of the case, simply disposed of\nthe constitution petitions on urgent motion on the statement of the\ncounsel for the petitioners/respondents that all these petitions may\nbe decided in terms of the order passed in CP No.D-1435 of 2023, and\non this statement, the learned High Court applied the order of\n\nCPLA 4-K/2025, etc. -l1-\n\nCP No.D-1435 of 2023 mutatis mutandis, disregarding the request of\nthe learned AAG who requested for time to file comments. Be that as\nit may, in our view, before disposing of the petitions on the basis of\nthe earlier order passed in CP No.D-1435 of 2023, the learned High\nCourt ought to have considered whether the facts of the case were the\nsame; whether the recruitment process was one and the same; and\nwhether the petitioners/respondents were issued offer letters in the\nsame recruitment process as the one in CP No.D-1435 of 2023, or it\nwas based on different advertisements with different terms and\nconditions by different departments of the Government of Sindh.\nThere is no doubt that each case has its own peculiar facts and\ncircumstances and before applying an order mutatis mutandis to\nanother case or lis, strict precaution is required to be made to assess\nwhether the earlier order of the Court is commensurate with both\nfacts and law. What we have observed is that the Order passed by the\nHigh Court in CP No.D-1435 of 2023 is essentially grounded on a\nfactual plane; neither had it decided any question of law nor it is\nbased upon or enunciated any principle of law which could be\nconsidered binding to maintain judicial propriety or judicial comity in\nterms of Article 201 of the Constitution. When we confronted the\nlearned counsel for the respondents with these points, they conveyed,\non instructions, their no objection if the matter is remanded to the\n\nHigh Court for a fresh adjudication.\n\n11. As a result of the above discussion, all Civil Petitions are\n\nconverted into appeals and disposed of in the following terms:-\n\ni. All the orders impugned in the aforesaid Civil\nPetitions are set aside. The Constitution Petitions\npreferred by the respondents before the High Court\nof Sindh shall be deemed to be pending and the\nmatter is remanded to the learned High Court of\nSindh for a fresh decision on merits after providing\nample opportunity of hearing to the parties,\npreferably within a period of two (02) months,\nexcluding the summer vacations.\n\nii. To save time, the petitioners may file their\ncomments with advance copies to the respondents\nbefore hearing of the Constitution Petitions. At the\n\nsame time, the respondents may _ also\nfile all relevant documents through a\nproper statement including copies of\n\nadvertisement, appointment/offer letters, joining\nreports, minutes/recommendations of the DRC,\netc., if not already on record, with advance copies\nto the counsel for the petitioners.\n\nCPLA 4-K/2025, etc. -12-\n\niii. The learned High Court shall decide all aforesaid\npending Constitution Petitions independently\nwithout being influenced by the order passed in\nC.P. No.D-1435 of 2023.\n\niv. The claim/assertion of the respondents/petitioners\nthat they have been appointed in Grades 1 to 4 on\nthe recommendations of the DRC after fulfilment of\ncodal formalities shall be considered by the learned\nHigh Court on its own merits.\n\n12. So far as CPLA No.182-K/2025 is concerned, though it is barred\nby 68 days, but the learned AG submitted that through this CPLA, the\nProvince of Sindh has challenged the Order passed by the Sindh High\nCourt in CP No.D-1435 of 2023 but they have no grievance against\nthe said order which was with regard to the recruitment process in\nthe Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities, Special\nEducation, Sukkur, wherein the learned High Court issued directions\nto the Regional Director of the Department to treat the said petitioners\nas newly appointed persons. In view of this statement, this petition is\n\ndismissed as not pressed.\n\nJudge\nJudge\nJudge\n\nKarachi\n\n05.06.2025\n\nKhalid\n\nApproved for reporting",

We have heard the learned counsel for both the parties.\n\n3. The main thrust of the prosecution revolves around the\nallegation that the petitioner hatched a conspiracy for the\ncommission of the offences mentioned in the FIRs. To this end, the\nlearned Special Prosecutor drew the attention of the Court to the\nocular statements of three witnesses, as well as electronic media,\nand argued that these clearly implicate the petitioner and connect\n\nhim with the commission of the alleged offences.\n\n4. When confronted with the grant of bail rendered by this Court\nto Mr. Ejaz Ahmad Chaudhary, Mr. Imtiaz Mehmood, and Mr. Hafiz\nFarhat Abbas, who were linked to the same occurrence and charged\nsimilarly to the present petitioner, the learned Special Prosecutor\nresponded that the case of the present petitioner was clearly\ndistinguishable and, therefore, the principle of consistency would\n\nnot apply in the instant bail matters.\n\n5. Further, when the learned Special Prosecutor was confronted\n\nwith the definite findings regarding the merits of the case recorded\n\nCriminal Petitions No.1184 to 1191 of 2025 :3:\n\nin the impugned order refusing bail to the present petitioner, he\nexplained that it is by now settled that the findings so recorded ina\nbail granting order are tentative in nature, to be restricted only to\nthe proceedings of bail and are not considered during the trial of an\n\naccused.\n\n6. The learned counsel for the petitioner, in rebuttal, vehemently\nopposed the contentions raised by the learned Special Prosecutor.\nIn particular, he emphasized that the principle of consistency had\nto be applied in favour of the petitioner, as all three accused, namely,\nEjaz Ahmad Chaudhary, Imtiaz Mahmood, and Hafiz Farhat Abbas,\nwere charged with alleged criminal conspiracy, and thus the case of\nthe petitioner would surely fall within the domain of parity, which\nhad to be positively considered in favour of the present petitioner.\nHe further explained that the cases of the present petitioner were on\na better footing, in particular, than that of Ejaz Anmad Chaudhary,\nwho had been granted bail by this Court. He pointed out that in the\ncase of Ejaz Ahmad Chaudhry, the investigation had been completed\nand the trial had commenced, whereas in the case of the present\npetitioner those stages had not yet been reached, and thus, his\n\nentitlement to bail is comparatively stronger.\n\n7. This Court has noted that the definite findings recorded by the\nlearned High Court in the impugned order, which go to the very root\nof the contested claims of the parties. However, without passing any\nfindings on the legality and veracity of the said findings, our concern\nat this stage is confined only to the fact that such findings have been\n\nrecorded at the stage of bail.\n\nCriminal Petitions No.1184 to 1191 of 2025 :4:\n\n8. Lest this Court pass any findings on the merits of the case\nwhich may prejudice either party at trial, it is sufficient to state that\nthe material brought on record regarding the alleged criminal\nconspiracy attributed to the petitioner requires scrutiny, and the\nsame would be best adjudged after recording pro and contra\nevidence during the trial. In addition thereto, the case of the\npetitioner has to be positively considered in view of the principle of\nconsistency, as others similarly placed have been granted bail by\n\nthis Court.\n\n9.

After his death the\nsubject house devolved upon them vide inheritance mutation\nNo.428 dated 16.03.2001. Respondents No.7 to 9 along with their\nmother, namely, Salma Sultana had executed a general power of\nattorney in favour of respondents No.1 to 6. However, it stood\nterminated on the death of their mother on 13.01.1999, but while\nacting as an attorney, the predecessor of respondents No.1 to\n6/Talib Hussain rented out the house in question to the Election\nCommission of Pakistan vide rent agreement dated 23.05.2015 on\nmonthly rent of Rs.55,000/-. Since respondent No.4 was carrying\non business of real estate with the name and style of “Dosti Estate\nBashira Town, Rawalpindi” and respondent No.5 was studying in a\nMedical College Islamabad and both had enjoyed good relations\nwith the petitioners being their neighbourer in Quetta. The\npetitioners No.1 & 2 had purchased an immovable property in\nBahria Town, Rawalpindi for a consideration of RS.20,000,000/-\nbut due to some management problem the payment was made\nthrough respondent No.4 having close interaction, had facilitated\nthe payment. But later Bahria Town Scheme failed and after about\nhalf a year, the petitioner approached respondents No.1 to 6 and\ndemanded their money with a profit of Rs.70 lacs for every six\n\nmonths. The predecessor of respondents No.1 to 6 namely, Talib\n\nCivil Appeal No. 209 of 2025 -3-\n\nHussain had agreed to negotiate and it was agreed that the\nproperty purchased by the petitioner would be purchased by\nrespondent No.4 for a consideration of Rs.1,60,00,000/- which\nwould be paid in two instalments. In order to arrange the payment,\nthe predecessor of respondents No.1 to 6 proceeded to Islamabad.\nHowever, on his back the respondents got registered FIR\nNo.161/2015, dated 14.11.2015, under section 406, 417, 419,\n420, 424, 109, 465, 468, 471, 34, 504, 506 PPC at police station\nIndustrial Area, Quetta against Talib Hussain and respondents\nNo.4 & 5. The predecessor of respondents No.1 to 6; Altaf Hussain\nwas arrested on 02.12.2015 in Islamabad and brought to Quetta\nand he was admitted to bail on 07.12.2015 and during the custody\nKhalid Mehmood Investigating Officer allegedly tortured him and\nforced him to execute a contract with the petitioners in respect of\nthe said house on 04.12.2015 which was authenticated by a\nNotary Public. During police custody, the female family members\nwere also compelled to produce the power of attorney and then\nAltaf Hussain the predecessor was brought before the Assistant\nCollector Grade-I Quetta where he had to execute mutation No.926\nof the subject house in the name of the petitioners and then on\n16.05.2015 the predecessor of respondents No.4 & 5 was acquitted\nby the Magistrate Quetta under section 249-A Cr.P.C. The\npetitioner, meanwhile, issued a notice to the Election Commission\nof Pakistan, Balochistan to deposit the rent in the account of\nMuhammad Jamshed. Because of this episode, unfortunately Altaf\n\nHussain, had died.\n\nCivil Appeal No. 209 of 2025 mia as\n\n3. After hearing the learned counsel for the petitioner and\nperusing the record, we have straightaway observed that,\nadmittedly, Altaf Hussain, the predecessor of respondents No.1 to\n6 remained in police custody in FIR No.161/2015 (supra) from\n02.12.0215 to 07.12.2015 and during this period an agreement\nwas got signed on 04.12.2015. It has been so admitted in written\nreply submitted by the petitioner in the suit filed by the\nrespondents. Besides, Arshad Khan (DW-5) identified the thumb\nimpression on the agreement (Exh.D-4) who had also admitted that\nthe Iqrarnama was executed after Juma prayer which means that\non 04.12.2015 Altaf Hussain was in police custody and was\nbrought before the said Magistrate. Even otherwise, the petitioners\nthrough their attorney admitted in cross-examination the\ntransitory remand by the Judicial Magistrate Islamabad to Quetta\nfor 02 days and then the production of Altaf Hussain to the\nMagistrate on 04.12.2015, before the grant of post arrest bail on\n07.12.2015.\n\n4. Under the law a transaction or an agreement executed under\ncustody or detention could potentially be considered as having\nbeen made under coercion, duress or undue influence, if the free\nconsent is not given or the expressed will was the outcome of such\ncircumstances.1 A person in custody or detention may be\nparticularly vulnerable to coercion or duress as his freedom or\nliability to resist is severely limited. A person under the custody of\nthe law enforcement agencies having control over the situation if\n\nenters into an agreement against best interest has an option to\n\n' Mst. Hamida Begum Vs. Mst. Murad Begum and others (PLD 1975 Supreme Court 624)\n\nCivil Appeal No. 209 of 2025 -5-\n\navoid it hence can be challenged in the court as voidable.2 A legally\nbinding contract requires several elements i.e. an offer, acceptance\nof that offer, consideration, the parties having legal capacity to\ncontract but not for an unlawful purpose, surely with a free\nconsent (meeting of the minds or consensus ad idem). If the\nconsent is precured by coercion, undue influence, fraud,\nmisrepresentation or mistake, the consent is not free.3 An undue\ninfluence is a demonstration of controlling the will of the other\nparty because of the prevailing situation of the main party. While\ncoercion is an act of enforcing a will but the undue influence or\nduress are the consequence of coercion. A contract procured under\nduress by one party over the other is void and any benefit received\ntherefrom must be restored and the loss be made good to such\nparty.*\n\n5. Duress in its more extended sense means that the degree of\nconstraint or danger either actually inflicted or threatened which\ncreates sufficient insecurity or an apprehension to overcome the\nmind and will of a person of ordinary fairness. It does not\nnecessarily imply that the means used should be in themselves\nunlawful, but includes the use of lawful means in an unlawful\nmanner or for an improper purpose. A duress by imprisonment,\nboth lawful or unlawful, to force the party into executing a contract\nis illegal.\n\n6. In such circumstances, the contract would be deemed to be\n\nvoid under section 2(g) of the Contract Act, 1872 since it lacked\nee\n\n? Lahore Stock Exchange Limited Vs. Pedrick J. Whyte Group (Pakistan) Ltd. and others (PLD 1990 Supreme Court\n48).\n\n> Dilber Hussain Hashmi and another Vs. Mustim Commercial Bank, Shahra-e-Igbal Branch, Quetta (2001 SCMR 265)\n* Pakcom Limited and others Vs. Federation of Pakistan and others (PLD 2011 SC 44)\n\nCivil Appeal No. 209 of 2025 -6-\n\nconsent as defined under section 13 of the said Act and free\nconsent under section 14 of the Act ibid. The complainant of the\nFIR was obviously in a position to dominate the will of accused\nAltaf Hussain and therefore, the burden lied upon the petitioner to\nprove that he had not exerted any influence to strike a\nbargain/deal. It has not come on record that respondents’\npredecessor or respondents No.4 & 5 have received any single\npenny from any transaction of Bahria Town project. The\npredecessor of respondents No.1 to 6; Altaf Hussain was the co-\nowner of the house and that executant Salma Sultana had died on\n13.01.1999 which terminated the agency (Exh.P-3). Obviously, the\ntransaction so made were based on the agreement which was void\ntherefore the learned High Court had declared the agreement dated\n04.12.2015 as void and consequently mutation No.926 was\ncancelled and mutation No.428 was restored.\n\nhe We have not been able to find ourselves in agreement to the\nlearned counsel for the petitioner that after the release of Altaf\nHussain the mutation was sanctioned and that it took one year to\nchallenge the said mutation which ought to have been challenged\nimmediately after the transaction. However, we are not impressed\nwith the said argument since the suit was filed within time and the\npetitioner was under heavy burden to prove that the transaction so\nmade was without any duress and was made with free consent. We\nhave not been able to find such evidence to support the case of the\npetitioner and that is the reason that the High Court has dealt the\nquestion extensively and had rightly held that the transaction\n\nmade consequent to the agreement in police custody was void.\n\nCivil Appeal No. 209 of 2025 -7-\n\n8. For the foregoing reasons, we do not find any ground to\ninterfere into the findings given by the High Court and dismiss this\n\ncivil appeal.\n\nISLAMABAD\n08.05.2025\nAPPROVED FOR REPORTING",

Civil Appeal No. 209 of 2025 Dke 2: Brief facts giving rise to the filing of this appeal are that the predecessor of respondents No.1 to 6, namely, Altaf Hussain and respondents No.7 to 9 filed a civil suit on 19.12.2016 against the petitioners claiming to be the legal heirs of Khizar Hussain who had an immovable property measuring 6800 sqft in Ward No.12 Mouza Urban Tehsil and District Quetta. After his death the subject house devolved upon them vide inheritance mutation No.428 dated 16.03.2001. Respondents No.7 to 9 along with their mother, namely, Salma Sultana had executed a general power of attorney in favour of respondents No.1 to 6. However, it stood terminated on the death of their mother on 13.01.1999, but while acting as an attorney, the predecessor of respondents No.1 to 6/Talib Hussain rented out the house in question to the Election Commission of Pakistan vide rent agreement dated 23.05.2015 on monthly rent of Rs.55,000/-. Since respondent No.4 was carrying on business of real estate with the name and style of Dosti Estate Bashira Town, Rawalpindi and respondent No.5 was studying in a Medical College Islamabad and both had enjoyed good relations with the petitioners being their neighbourer in Quetta. The petitioners No.1 2 had purchased an immovable property in Bahria Town, Rawalpindi for a consideration of RS.20,000,000/- but due to some management problem the payment was made through respondent No.4 having close interaction, had facilitated the payment. But later Bahria Town Scheme failed and after about half a year, the petitioner approached respondents No.1 to 6 and demanded their money with a profit of Rs.70 lacs for every six months. The predecessor of respondents No.1 to 6 namely, Talib Civil Appeal No. 209 of 2025 -3Hussain had agreed to negotiate and it was agreed that the property purchased by the petitioner would be purchased by respondent No.4 for a consideration of Rs.1,60,00,000/- which would be paid in two instalments. In order to arrange the payment, the predecessor of respondents No.1 to 6 proceeded to Islamabad. However, on his back the respondents got registered FIR No.161/2015, dated 14.11.2015, under section 406, 417, 419, 420, 424, 109, 465, 468, 471, 34, 504, 506 PPC at police station Industrial Area, Quetta against Talib Hussain and respondents No.4 5. The predecessor of respondents No.1 to 6; Altaf Hussain was arrested on 02.12.2015 in Islamabad and brought to Quetta and he was admitted to bail on 07.12.2015 and during the custody Khalid Mehmood Investigating Officer allegedly tortured him and forced him to execute a contract with the petitioners in respect of the said house on 04.12.2015 which was authenticated by a Notary Public. During police custody, the female family members were also compelled to produce the power of attorney and then Altaf Hussain the predecessor was brought before the Assistant Collector Grade-I Quetta where he had to execute mutation No.926 of the subject house in the name of the petitioners and then on 16.05.2015 the predecessor of respondents No.4 5 was acquitted by the Magistrate Quetta under section 249-A Cr.P.C. The petitioner, meanwhile, issued a notice to the Election Commission of Pakistan, Balochistan to deposit the rent in the account of Muhammad Jamshed. Because of this episode, unfortunately Altaf Hussain, had died. Civil Appeal No. 209 of 2025 mia as 3. After hearing the learned counsel for the petitioner and perusing the record, we have straightaway observed that, admittedly, Altaf Hussain, the predecessor of respondents No.1 to 6 remained in police custody in FIR No.161/2015 supra from 02.12.0215 to 07.12.2015 and during this period an agreement was got signed on 04.12.2015. It has been so admitted in written reply submitted by the petitioner in the suit filed by the respondents. Besides, Arshad Khan DW-5 identified the thumb impression on the agreement Exh.D-4 who had also admitted that the Iqrarnama was executed after Juma prayer which means that on 04.12.2015 Altaf Hussain was in police custody and was brought before the said Magistrate. Even otherwise, the petitioners through their attorney admitted in cross-examination the transitory remand by the Judicial Magistrate Islamabad to Quetta for 02 days and then the production of Altaf Hussain to the Magistrate on 04.12.2015, before the grant of post arrest bail on 07.12.2015. 4. Under the law a transaction or an agreement executed under custody or detention could potentially be considered as having been made under coercion, duress or undue influence, if the free consent is not given or the expressed will was the outcome of such circumstances.1 A person in custody or detention may be particularly vulnerable to coercion or duress as his freedom or liability to resist is severely limited. A person under the custody of the law enforcement agencies having control over the situation if enters into an agreement against best interest has an option to Mst. Hamida Begum Vs. Mst. Murad Begum and others PLD 1975 Supreme Court 624 Civil Appeal No. 209 of 2025 -5avoid it hence can be challenged in the court as voidable.2 A legally binding contract requires several elements i.e. an offer, acceptance of that offer, consideration, the parties having legal capacity to contract but not for an unlawful purpose, surely with a free consent meeting of the minds or consensus ad idem . If the consent is precured by coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation or mistake, the consent is not free.3 An undue influence is a demonstration of controlling the will of the other party because of the prevailing situation of the main party. While coercion is an act of enforcing a will but the undue influence or duress are the consequence of coercion. A contract procured under duress by one party over the other is void and any benefit received therefrom must be restored and the loss be made good to such party. 5. Duress in its more extended sense means that the degree of constraint or danger either actually inflicted or threatened which creates sufficient insecurity or an apprehension to overcome the mind and will of a person of ordinary fairness. It does not necessarily imply that the means used should be in themselves unlawful, but includes the use of lawful means in an unlawful manner or for an improper purpose. A duress by imprisonment, both lawful or unlawful, to force the party into executing a contract is illegal. 6. In such circumstances, the contract would be deemed to be void under section 2 g of the Contract Act, 1872 since it lacked ee ? Lahore Stock Exchange Limited Vs. Pedrick J.

Federation of Pakistan and others PLD 2011 SC 44 Civil Appeal No. 209 of 2025 -6consent as defined under section 13 of the said Act and free consent under section 14 of the Act ibid. The complainant of the FIR was obviously in a position to dominate the will of accused Altaf Hussain and therefore, the burden lied upon the petitioner to prove that he had not exerted any influence to strike a bargain/deal. It has not come on record that respondents predecessor or respondents No.4 5 have received any single penny from any transaction of Bahria Town project. The predecessor of respondents No.1 to 6; Altaf Hussain was the coowner of the house and that executant Salma Sultana had died on 13.01.1999 which terminated the agency Exh.P-3 . Obviously, the transaction so made were based on the agreement which was void therefore the learned High Court had declared the agreement dated 04.12.2015 as void and consequently mutation No.926 was cancelled and mutation No.428 was restored. he We have not been able to find ourselves in agreement to the learned counsel for the petitioner that after the release of Altaf Hussain the mutation was sanctioned and that it took one year to challenge the said mutation which ought to have been challenged immediately after the transaction. However, we are not impressed with the said argument since the suit was filed within time and the petitioner was under heavy burden to prove that the transaction so made was without any duress and was made with free consent. We have not been able to find such evidence to support the case of the petitioner and that is the reason that the High Court has dealt the question extensively and had rightly held that the transaction made consequent to the agreement in police custody was void. Civil Appeal No. 209 of 2025 -78. For the foregoing reasons, we do not find any ground to interfere into the findings given by the High Court and dismiss this civil appeal.

A. No. 43130-J/2023)\n\nZahid Nawaz Appellant(s)\nVersus\nThe State, etc. Respondent(s)\nFor the Petitioner(s): Mr. Sheikh Sakhawal Ali, ASC\nSyed Rifaqat Hussain Shah, AOR\nFor the State: Chauhdry Irfan Zia, Addl PG\nAssisted by: Mahnoor Omer, Law Clerk\nDate of Hearing: 16.06.2025\nJUDGMENT\n\nMuhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, J. Through this petition for leave to\nappeal under Article 185 (3) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of\nPakistan, 1973, Zahid Nawaz has challenged the judgment dated\n10.12.2024, which was rendered by the Lahore High Court in Lahore.\nThe judgment upheld his conviction and sentence under Section 9 (c) of\nthe CNS Act, 1997.\n\n2. The FIR concisely states that on 14.12.2022 at about 8:30 p.m.,\nMuhammad Naeem Zia, Inspector (PW-2), and other police officials\napprehended the appellant, Zahid Nawaz, at a chowk. They seized a\nblack polythene bag from Nawaz's right hand, which was alleged to\ncontain charas. 1280 grams of contraband were discovered during the\nweighing process. On the spot, the sample and the remaining bulk were\nsealed, and a 64-gram sample was separated for chemical analysis. FIR\nNo. 500/2022 was promptly registered at the Sahianwala Police Station.\n\nCri. P. No. 433/2025.\n\n3. The petitioner's counsel contended that the prosecution's case is\nplagued by numerous legal and factual deficiencies that necessitate\nacquittal. Despite the fact that the alleged search occurred in a\npopulated area, he argued that the entire case is predicated on the\ntestimony of police officials, with no attempt to associate any private or\nindependent witness at the time of recovery. He underscored that the\nimpartiality of the investigation was compromised by Muhammad Naeem\nZia, Inspector (PW-2), who served as both the Investigating Officer and\nthe complainant. The unexplained 15-day delay in transporting the\nsample to the FSL laboratory was emphasized by the learned counsel,\nwhich casts doubt on the chain of custody and renders the report\nunreliable. Moreover, he maintained that the remaining quantity was\nonly deposited in Saddar Malkhana on 14.01.2023, which further\n\nexacerbated concerns about safe custody.\n\n4. Conversely, the learned counsel for the State endorsed the Trial Court\nand the High Court's conclusions, contending that the prosecution had\neffectively established its case through the consistent and reassuring\ntestimony of police witnesses. He argued that the case is not\nautomatically vitiated by the sheer delay in sending the sample to the\nForensic Science laboratory, in the absence of proof of tampering. The\nlearned Law Officer also contended that police officials are competent\nwitnesses and that there was no evidence of mala fide intent or animosity\n\nto unjustly implicate the petitioner.\n\n5. On December 14, 2022, at 8:30 p.m., the prosecution apprehended\nthe petitioner from Kanan Sian Chowk. A black polythene bag containing\n1280 grams of charas was retrieved from his possession. The prosecution\nmaintained that a 64-gram sample was separated for chemical analysis,\nand it was subsequently tested positive by the PFSA. However, we\nobserved that the sample was transmitted for analysis on 29.12.2022,\nwith a 15-day delay. In the same vein, the road certificate 876/21\nindicates that the alleged remaining 1216 grams of charas were\ndeposited with Malkhana on 26.12.2022. Consequently, the prosecution\nhad failed to present any evidence to the trial court that would establish\nthe safe custody of the recovered substance at the local police station or\nthe safe transmission of the sample of the recovered substance from the\npolice station to the office of the Chemical Examiner. This Court has\n\nconsistently maintained that a conviction cannot be recorded in the\n\nCri. P. No. 433/2025.\n\nabsence of any evidence regarding the safe custody or safe transmission\nof the recovered substance or the samples thereof. In this regard,\nreference can be made to the cases of \"Amjad Ali v. The State\" (2012\nSCMR 577) and \"Ikramullah and others v. The State\" (2015 SCMR 1002).\n\n6. Additionally, we have given careful consideration to the fact that the\ncomplainant, Muhammad Naeem Zia (PW-2), conducted an investigation\ninto the case. The importance of a fair investigation is a guaranteed\nconstitutional right under Article 10 A of the Constitution of the Islamic\nRepublic of Pakistan 1973. This right is the foundation of a fair trial and\nnecessitates that the complainant and the investigating officer are not\nthe same person, particularly in criminal cases registered under the\nprovisions of the CNS Act, 1997, which carries stringent punishments.\nNot only must justice be served, but it must also be appearing to be\nserved. It was necessary to eliminate any potential bias or predetermined\nconclusion. This requirement is particularly critical in laws that impose\nsevere penalties and reverse the burden of proof. We acknowledge that\nthe complainant-police officer is not legally prohibited from conducting\nan investigation of a case registered under CNSA, 1997. Nevertheless, the\ninvestigation may be challenged on the basis of bias or a genuine\nlikelihood of bias on the part of the investigating officer. In the instant\ncase from the very inception, the issue of bias was challenged by the\npetitioner, he responded to Question 7 as follows in order to portray the\n\ninvestigation as biased and unfair:\n\n“Case is false against me. I had Tandoor/hotel in front of police\nstation and police officials took free as well credit delivery of food\nfrom said hotel. The complainant Naeem Zia Inspector borrow\nfacility of food from said hotel and huge money is outstanding\nagainst him. When I claimed bill/money of food from Naeem Zia\nInspector, he became furious and due to this grudge he was falsely\ninvolved me in this case and planted norcotics against me. All the\nPWs are police officers and officials who deposed falsely to\nstrengthen the false prosecution case. I am innocent deserves for\n\nacquittal.”\n\n7. The investigation was conducted entirely by the complainant, as\nevidenced by the record. There is no evidence to suggest that the\n\nCri. P. No. 433/2025.\n\ninvestigation was transferred to an independent investigating officer. It is\nnot the case ef prosecution in which no other independent investigating\nofficer was available to conduct an impartial investigation. Given the\nallegations made by the petitioner against the complainant/ investigating\nofficer during the recording of this statement under section 342 Cr.P.C.,\nwe are of the opinion that the entire investigation, which included the\ndrafting of a written complaint (Exh, PB), the preparation of a seizure\nmemo (Exh.PA), the creation of a site plan (Exh.PC), the recording of\nwitness statements under section 161 CR.P.C., the preparation of a\nreport under section 173, the deposit of the recovered substance with\nMalkhana, and the subsequent delivery of the substance to the Chemical\nExaminer has resulted in a miscarriage of justice for the petitioner in\n\nterms of a fair investigation.\n\n%. The investigation in a criminal offense, particularly under the\nprovisions of the CNS Act, 1997, which carries a reverse burden of proof\nunder section 29, must be free from objectionable features or infirmities\nthat may legitimately lead to a grievance on the part of the accused that\nthe investigation was unfair and carried out with an ulterior motive. In\nthis regard, guidance can also be sought from Chapter 25 of the\nInvestigation from Police Rules, 1934. The text of Rule 25.2 (3) is as\n\nfollows:\n\n“It is the duty of an Investigating Officer to find out the truth of the\nmatter under investigation. His object shall be to discovered the\nactual facts of the case and to arrest the real offender or offenders.\nHe shall not commit himself prematurely to any view of the facts\n\nfor or against any person.”\n\n%. Similarly, this Court in the case of Ikramuddin Rajput v. The\nInspector General of Police Sindh (2024 SCMR 510), while underscoring\n\nthe role and importance of an Investigating Officer observed as under:\n\n“7. No doubt, an Investigating Officer plays a crucial role\nin the administration of the criminal justice system and the\nconstituent of investigation report and its worth keeps hold\nof plenteous value and repercussions on the outcome of any\ncriminal case.

            "CleanedText": "JUDGMENT Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, J. Through this petition for leave to appeal under Article 185 3 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, Zahid Nawaz has challenged the judgment dated 10.12.2024, which was rendered by the Lahore High Court in Lahore. The judgment upheld his conviction and sentence under Section 9 c of the CNS Act, 1997. 2. The FIR concisely states that on 14.12.2022 at about 8:30 p.m., Muhammad Naeem Zia, Inspector PW-2 , and other police officials apprehended the appellant, Zahid Nawaz, at a chowk. They seized a black polythene bag from Nawaz s right hand, which was alleged to contain charas. 1280 grams of contraband were discovered during the weighing process. On the spot, the sample and the remaining bulk were sealed, and a 64-gram sample was separated for chemical analysis. FIR No. 500/2022 was promptly registered at the Sahianwala Police Station. Cri. P. No. 433/2025. 3. The petitioner s counsel contended that the prosecution s case is plagued by numerous legal and factual deficiencies that necessitate acquittal. Despite the fact that the alleged search occurred in a populated area, he argued that the entire case is predicated on the testimony of police officials, with no attempt to associate any private or independent witness at the time of recovery. He underscored that the impartiality of the investigation was compromised by Muhammad Naeem Zia, Inspector PW-2 , who served as both the Investigating Officer and the complainant. The unexplained 15-day delay in transporting the sample to the FSL laboratory was emphasized by the learned counsel, which casts doubt on the chain of custody and renders the report unreliable. Moreover, he maintained that the remaining quantity was only deposited in Saddar Malkhana on 14.01.2023, which further exacerbated concerns about safe custody. 4. Conversely, the learned counsel for the State endorsed the Trial Court and the High Court s conclusions, contending that the prosecution had effectively established its case through the consistent and reassuring testimony of police witnesses. He argued that the case is not automatically vitiated by the sheer delay in sending the sample to the Forensic Science laboratory, in the absence of proof of tampering. The learned Law Officer also contended that police officials are competent witnesses and that there was no evidence of mala fide intent or animosity to unjustly implicate the petitioner. 5. On December 14, 2022, at 8:30 p.m., the prosecution apprehended the petitioner from Kanan Sian Chowk. A black polythene bag containing 1280 grams of charas was retrieved from his possession. The prosecution maintained that a 64-gram sample was separated for chemical analysis, and it was subsequently tested positive by the PFSA. However, we observed that the sample was transmitted for analysis on 29.12.2022, with a 15-day delay. In the same vein, the road certificate 876/21 indicates that the alleged remaining 1216 grams of charas were deposited with Malkhana on 26.12.2022. Consequently, the prosecution had failed to present any evidence to the trial court that would establish the safe custody of the recovered substance at the local police station or the safe transmission of the sample of the recovered substance from the police station to the office of the Chemical Examiner. This Court has consistently maintained that a conviction cannot be recorded in the Cri. P. No. 433/2025. absence of any evidence regarding the safe custody or safe transmission of the recovered substance or the samples thereof. In this regard, reference can be made to the cases of Amjad Ali v. The State 2012 SCMR 577 and Ikramullah and others v. The State 2015 SCMR 1002 . 6. Additionally, we have given careful consideration to the fact that the complainant, Muhammad Naeem Zia PW-2 , conducted an investigation into the case. The importance of a fair investigation is a guaranteed constitutional right under Article 10 A of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973. This right is the foundation of a fair trial and necessitates that the complainant and the investigating officer are not the same person, particularly in criminal cases registered under the provisions of the CNS Act, 1997, which carries stringent punishments. Not only must justice be served, but it must also be appearing to be served. It was necessary to eliminate any potential bias or predetermined conclusion. This requirement is particularly critical in laws that impose severe penalties and reverse the burden of proof. We acknowledge that the complainant-police officer is not legally prohibited from conducting an investigation of a case registered under CNSA, 1997. Nevertheless, the investigation may be challenged on the basis of bias or a genuine likelihood of bias on the part of the investigating officer. In the instant case from the very inception, the issue of bias was challenged by the petitioner, he responded to Question 7 as follows in order to portray the investigation as biased and unfair: Case is false against me. I had Tandoor/hotel in front of police station and police officials took free as well credit delivery of food from said hotel. The complainant Naeem Zia Inspector borrow facility of food from said hotel and huge money is outstanding against him. When I claimed bill/money of food from Naeem Zia Inspector, he became furious and due to this grudge he was falsely involved me in this case and planted norcotics against me. All the PWs are police officers and officials who deposed falsely to strengthen the false prosecution case. I am innocent deserves for acquittal. 7. The investigation was conducted entirely by the complainant, as evidenced by the record. There is no evidence to suggest that the Cri. P. No. 433/2025. investigation was transferred to an independent investigating officer. It is not the case ef prosecution in which no other independent investigating officer was available to conduct an impartial investigation. Given the allegations made by the petitioner against the complainant/ investigating officer during the recording of this statement under section 342 Cr.P.C., we are of the opinion that the entire investigation, which included the drafting of a written complaint Exh, PB , the preparation of a seizure memo Exh.PA , the creation of a site plan Exh.PC , the recording of witness statements under section 161 CR.P.C., the preparation of a report under section 173, the deposit of the recovered substance with Malkhana, and the subsequent delivery of the substance to the Chemical Examiner has resulted in a miscarriage of justice for the petitioner in terms of a fair investigation. . The investigation in a criminal offense, particularly under the provisions of the CNS Act, 1997, which carries a reverse burden of proof under section 29, must be free from objectionable features or infirmities that may legitimately lead to a grievance on the part of the accused that the investigation was unfair and carried out with an ulterior motive. In this regard, guidance can also be sought from Chapter 25 of the Investigation from Police Rules, 1934. The text of Rule 25.2 3 is as follows: It is the duty of an Investigating Officer to find out the truth of the matter under investigation. His object shall be to discovered the actual facts of the case and to arrest the real offender or offenders. He shall not commit himself prematurely to any view of the facts for or against any person. . Similarly, this Court in the case of Ikramuddin Rajput v. The Inspector General of Police Sindh 2024 SCMR 510 , while underscoring the role and importance of an Investigating Officer observed as under: 7. No doubt, an Investigating Officer plays a crucial role in the administration of the criminal justice system and the constituent of investigation report and its worth keeps hold of plenteous value and repercussions on the outcome of any criminal case. The criminal justice system signifies the procedure for adjudicating criminal cases in order to award a sentence to the culprits for the offence committed by them; and the foremost objective is to penalize the offenders we Sale, ooo Cri. P. No, 433/2025. subject to the proof whether the offense has been committed or not, and this very important aspect is attached with the burden of proof on the prosecution which has direct nexus with the investigation report and the material and evidence collected by the Investigation Officer in discharge of his sacred duty to bring out the truth without engaging in any manipulation, favoritism, or exceeding the bounds of the law. A defective investigation gradually contaminates the judicial process and poses a hazard to human rights. In unison, it is the duty of superior officers and officers in charge of police stations to ensure that the Investigating Officer follows the provisions of law conscientiously, without any breach, conducting an impartial and honest investigation with the sole aim of bringing the truth to light. 10.

In light of the aforementioned discussion and in order to protect the accused s fundamental right to a fair trial under Article 10-A of the Constitution, we are of the considered view that a complainant should avoid acting as the Investigating Officer in a criminal case as far as it is practical, in such circumstances where he has acted as the complainant, the reasons shall be made part of the record if prejudice is pleaded by the defense. 12.

No.753-B of 2025)\n\nAqeel Ahmed Khan ...Petitioner\nVersus\nThe State through Federal Prosecutor General,\nIslamabad and another ...Respondents\nFor the petitioner: Raja Mohammad Nadeem, ASC\nFor the State: Mr. Abdul Khaliq Thind, ASC\na/w Tauqir Abbas, SI\nComplainant: Nazir Hussain, in person\nDate of hearing: 12.08.2025\nORDER\n\nAthar Minallah, J.- The petitioner, Aqeel Ahmed Khan, was\nnominated in crime report No.201 dated 28.03.2023 registered at\nPolice Station Margalla, Islamabad for commission of the alleged\noffence under section 489-F of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860\n(PPC). The petitioner was arrested on 23.01.2025 and he had\nsought post arrest bail which was declined by the trial court vide\norder dated 26.03.2025. The petitioner’s post arrest bail was also\ndismissed by the High Court vide the impugned order dated\n\n09.05.2025.\n\n2. We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well\nas the learned State Counsel. The complainant is also in attendance\nand he had stated that he did not intend to engage a counsel. The\n\nrecord has been perused with the able assistance of the learned\n\ncounsels.\n\nCrl.P.No.960 of 2025\n\n3. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offence under\nsection 489-F of PPC. The said offence is, admittedly, of the category\nwhich falls within the non-prohibitory clause of section 497 of the\nCode of the Criminal Procedure, 1898 (‘Cr.P.C.). This Court has\nconsistently held that while considering the grant of bail, where\noffences fall within the non-prohibitory clause, the granting of bail\nhas to be considered favourably as a rule, but may be declined in\nexceptional cases. The extra ordinary and exceptional cases, inter\nalia, includes likelihood of abscondence of the accused;\napprehension of the accused tempering with the prosecution\nevidence; and the danger of the offence being repeated}. It is further\nnoted that the quantum of amount involved in a case registered\nunder section 489-F cannot be treated as an exception to the general\nrule that in cases falling under the category of non-prohibitory\nclause, bail shall be considered favourably. The offence under\nsection 489-F of PPC is not a provision which is intended by the\nlegislature to be used for recovery of the alleged amount. The\ncriminal proceedings are meant to determine the guilt and then to\nsentence an accused. The legislature has set out the framework for\nrecovery of an alleged amount in case of a dishonoured cheque\nunder Order XXXVII of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908. The\npetitioner in this case is, therefore, entitled to be granted bail since\nthe State counsel has not been able to persuade us that exceptional\ncircumstances exist in order to justify denying to the petitioner the\nconcession of post arrest bail. Moreover, whether or not the alleged\n\noffence is attracted in the facts and circumstances of this case also\n\nrequire further probe.\n\n1 Zafar Iqbal v.

The extra ordinary and exceptional cases, inter alia, includes likelihood of abscondence of the accused; apprehension of the accused tempering with the prosecution evidence; and the danger of the offence being repeated . It is further noted that the quantum of amount involved in a case registered under section 489-F cannot be treated as an exception to the general rule that in cases falling under the category of non-prohibitory clause, bail shall be considered favourably. The offence under section 489-F of PPC is not a provision which is intended by the legislature to be used for recovery of the alleged amount. The criminal proceedings are meant to determine the guilt and then to sentence an accused. The legislature has set out the framework for recovery of an alleged amount in case of a dishonoured cheque under Order XXXVII of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908. The petitioner in this case is, therefore, entitled to be granted bail since the State counsel has not been able to persuade us that exceptional circumstances exist in order to justify denying to the petitioner the concession of post arrest bail.

Misc. No.1856-B-2025 & Crl. Misc. No.1864-B-2025,\nwhereby their applications for bail after arrest in case FIR No.03 dated\n18.03.2025 under sections 9(2)8, 15 of the Control of Narcotics Act, 1997\nregistered with Police Station ANF, Mianwali, were dismissed.\n\n2. The petitioners are implicated in the aforementioned case and the\nallegations against them are that on spy information, they were apprehended\nalong with co-accused and from their possession, Methamphetamine (Ice)\nweighing 1000-grams each was recovered totaling to 3.2 kilo grams.\n\n3. Learned counsel for the petitioners inter alia contended that since the\n\nnarcotic substance recovered from each petitioner is approximately 1000-\n\nCrl. PLA Nos.537 & 559-2025\ngrams, hence the case would not fall within prohibitory clause and they are\nentitled to concession of bail on the principles laid down in case reported as\nTariq Bashir and 5 others Vs. The State (PLD 1995 SC 34). It was contended\n\nthat prosecution has made out a case of 3.2 kgs of the narcotic substance\ncollectively against each accused/petitioner, which is uncalled for at this\nstage inasmuch, whether they had conscious knowledge of the possession\nof the narcotic substance by the fellow passenger/co-accused, is a question\nof fact, which can only be determined after recording of evidence. It was\ncontended that the case, against the petitioners, is of further inquiry to the\nextent of collective recovery of the narcotic substance amounting to 3.2 kgs.\nIn support of his contentions, learned counsel for the petitioners placed\nreliance on case reported as Atif Ur Rehman Vs. The State (2021 SCMR324).\n\n4. Learned Prosecutor General, ANF inter alia contended that recovery of\n3.2 kgs of narcotic substance would be attributed to each accused\nseparately. It was contended that this Court in case reported as The State\nthrough Director ANF Peshawar Vs. Rashmali Khan _and others (PLD 2016\n\nSupreme Court 471) has held that on the basis of conscious knowledge of\nthe possession, each accused is responsible for the collective recovery and\nis to be punished accordingly.\n\n5. Heard.\n\n6. The petitioners are implicated in the afore-mentioned case for alleged\npossession and transportation of the narcotic substance which is\nMethamphetamine (Ice) totaling to 3.2 kgs.\n\n7. — Thecase of the petitioners is that psychotropic substance is Ice and as\nper the table provided in subsection (2) of Section 9 of the Control of\nNarcotic Substances Act, 1997 (the Act), if the quantity recovered is up to\none kilogram, the imprisonment is up to seven years but is not less than five\nyears along with fine, however, as per Sr. No.7 of the table, if the quantity is\nmore than 2-kgs and up to 3-kgs, the punishment would be up to fourteen\nyears but not less than ten years along with fine and, in case, the quantity\nrecovered is more than 3-kgs and up to 4-kgs, the imprisonment is up to\ntwenty years, but is not less than fourteen years along with fine of\nRs.18,00,000/-. As per the fourth proviso to subsection (2) of Section 9 of the\n\nAct, if the quantity exceeds 4-kgs and the narcotic substance is Ice, the\n\nCrl. PLA Nos.537 & 559-2025\n\naccused has to be punished with life imprisonment and fine, which is not to\nbe less than two and half million rupees.\n\n8. The moot point, in the instant petitions, is whether at present, each\npetitioner is to be attributed one kilogram of the narcotic substance as\nrecovered from each accused or he would also be responsible for the\ncollective recovery of 3.2 kgs, as is the case of the prosecution on the basis\nthat accused had conscious possession and knowledge of the narcotic\nsubstance possessed by the others. There is ample case law which reflect\nthe approach of the courts with respect to the doctrine of ‘conscious\nknowledge’ in narcotic cases. Undoubtedly, the prosecution has to prove its\ncase on the basis of the Latin maxim ‘actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea’\n(an act does not make a person guilty unless the mind is also guilty). In this\nregard, the prosecution has to prove not only that the prohibited act was\ncommitted by the accused, but also, he had a requisite mental state mens\nrea for the commission of the offence. For the purposes of present case, the\nlegal landscape surrounding narcotics laws often grapples with the intricate\nconcept of ‘possession’ and the ‘knowledge’ thereof. The possession can be\nphysical and conscious, but there can also be constructive possession, if the\nperson/accused had the knowledge that the other person also is carrying\nnarcotic substance and they all have common design, sale and\ntransportation of the narcotic substance. The word ‘possession’ has been\ndefined in Black’s Law Dictionary, tenth Edition Page 1351, as 1. ‘the fact\nhaving or holding property in one’s power; the exercise of dominion over\nproperty’ 2. ‘the right under which one may exercise control over something\nto the exclusion of all others’. The word ‘possession’ was explained in\njudgment reported as Muhammad Siddique J Jalal ADA Vs. The State (PLJ\n\n1985 FSC 50) as ‘actual possession’ and not ‘constructive possession’.\nUnder the Act, the ‘knowledge’ and ‘conscious possession of narcotic’ is\ncritical in evidence appreciation, particularly when large quantities of\nnarcotic are found in vehicles. Section 29 of the Act creates a presumption\nand addresses it in a manner that there is a presumption from possession of\nillicit articles that the accused has committed an offence, if found in\npossession of any narcotic drug or psychotropics i.e. the substance,\nhowever needless to observe that this section does not absolve the\n\nprosecution from proving its case beyond doubt and the burden shifts to the\n\nCrl. PLA Nos.537 & 559-2025\n\naccused only after the prosecution has established recovery beyond\nreasonable doubt. The determination of conscious possession is largely a\nfactual matter, heavily relying on the specific circumstances of each case.\nThe court has to analyze the evidence to ascertain accused’s mental state\nregarding seized narcotics. The courts often infer conscious possession from\ncircumstantial evidence rather than direct admission and all the surrounding\nfactors are to be looked into which include or not restricted to; the manner of\nconcealment, the quantity of drugs, the relationship of the accused to the\nplace of recovery (owner, driver, passenger, etc.), the conduct of the\naccused, any financial transactions or communications linked to the drugs\nand/or prior history of the accused. It is emphasized that the burden of proof\nalways remains with the prosecution to establish that narcotic drugs were\nrecovered from the possession and control of the accused and when there is\nmore than one accused that each had conscious knowledge of the\npossession. Only if and when the prosecution has discharged its initial\nburden of possession and conscious knowledge, when there is more than\none accused. The accused can rebut this presumption by demonstrating that\nthey lacked conscious knowledge and this often arises in cases where drugs\nare found in a vehicle driven by the accused but owned by someone else, or\nconcealed in secret cavities, or where the accused claims that they were\nunaware of the contents of a package. To establish possession and\nconscious knowledge thereof is not always easy for the prosecution.\n\n9. In a case like the present one, where there is more than one accused\nand each has been attributed a certain quantity of the narcotic substance,\ntotal quantity recovered is to be attributed to each petitioner/accused\nseparately at the stage of bail. In other words, conscious knowledge plays a\nsignificant role at the bail stage. It is an established principle that deeper\nappreciation of the record is generally not undertaken at the preliminary\nstage and the court only has to see, if the accused is prima facie connected\nwith the offence. In cases where narcotic substance is recovered from the\nvehicle, conscious possession often arises for drivers and passengers,\nhowever, it is a question of fact. The doctrine of knowledge of the possession\nis based on the evidence available on record and judicial interpretation made\nby this Court and the High Courts over a period of times underscore the\n\nnecessity of establishing this mental element after examination of the\n\nCrl. PLA Nos.537 & 559-2025\nevidence available on record and only prosecution discharged the initial\nburden. The presumption arises and the defence has to discharge the same.\nThe approach of this Court with respect to conscious knowledge of the\npossession somewhat sways but the dominance of the approach is that at\nbail stage, accused cannot be burdened with the total quantity recovered\nand is to be given the benefit of doubt for attributing him with only the\nquantity recovered from him or at his pointation. In case reported as Gul\nManan _ Vs. The State (2021 SCMR 1804), this Court observed that the\n\nquestion of whether an accused, not driving the vehicle, had conscious\n\nknowledge of concealed narcotics needs serious consideration and should\nbe determined by the trial court after recording evidence and in such like\ncircumstances, the case against the accused, calls for further inquiry under\nsection 497 Cr.P.C. In case reported as Nazeem Ullah and others Vs. The\nState (2020 SCMR 356), this Court granted bail while observing that the\nquestion of conscious knowledge or possession of the recovered narcotic\nsubstance should be determined at the time of trial. Likewise, in case\nreported as Anwar Khan and another Vs. The State (2006 SCMR 1343), this\nCourt observed that mere presence in the car, which belonged to son-in-law,\nwas insufficient to prove conscious knowledge.\n\n10. Thereis ample case law which deals with the fact that if circumstantial\nevidence is placed on record, then conscious knowledge is established, but\nall those cases are at bail stage, where only after the examination of the\nevidence, same has been held accordingly’.\n\n11. The crux of the above discussion and the case law on the subject is\nthat at the stage of bail, unless there is confidence inspiring material\navailable on record that each accused knew about the possession of the\nnarcotic substance by the others, the total quantity cannot be attributed to\nevery petitioner/accused separately and they are to be attributed with the\nquantity recovered from each petitioner/accused or on their pointation. Only\nafter recording of the evidence and where the prosecution has proved that\neach individual/accused had conscious knowledge of the possession of\nnarcotic substance or others, they can be implicated with the total quantity\n\nrecovered. In the case in hand, there is nothing on record which shows that\n\n' The State through Director ANF, Peshawar Vs. Rashmali Khan and others (PLD 2016 Supreme Court 471),\nQaiserullah Vs. State (2009 SCMR 579), Nadir Khan Vs. State (1988 SCMR 1899), Muhammad Riaz and 2 others\nVs. The State (2006 SCMR 1378) and Amanat Ali and 2 others Vs. The State (2008 SCMR 991).\n\nCrl. PLA Nos.537 & 559-2025\npetitioners are aware of the others’ possession of the narcotic substance,\nhence in the circumstances, they can only be implicated to the extent of\nnarcotic substance recovered from their possession individually which\nweighs 1-kg each and punishment provided for the same in the Table\ncontained in section 9(2) ibid is up to seven years, which does not fall within\nprohibitory clause of section 497 Cr.P.C. hence the law laid down by this\n\nCourt in case reported as Tariq Bashir and 5-others Vs. The State (PLD 1995\n\nSC 34) supra is attracted in the present case. There is nothing on record\nwhich shows that the exceptions laid down in the referred case are attracted\nin the present case. In the referred case, it was observed by this Court that\nwhere the offence does not fall within prohibitory clause, grant of bail is a\nrule and refusal is an exception unless there are exceptional circumstances,\nwhich inter alia includes repetition of offence or abscontion.\n\n12. An apprehension was expressed by learned Prosecutor General, ANF\nthat one of the accused is an Afghan National and he may abscond, however,\nthat per se is not a convincing ground for refusal of the bail.\n\n13. For the above reasons, instant petitions are converted into appeals and\nare allowed; consequently, the petitioners are released on bail after arrest, in\nthe above-mentioned case, subject to furnishing bail bonds in the sum of\nRs.5,00,000/- by petitioner Muhammad Daud and Rs.2,00,000/- by petitioner\nAmanullah with one surety each in the like amount to the satisfaction of\nlearned trial court.\n\n14.

It is an established principle that deeper appreciation of the record is generally not undertaken at the preliminary stage and the court only has to see, if the accused is prima facie connected with the offence. In cases where narcotic substance is recovered from the vehicle, conscious possession often arises for drivers and passengers, however, it is a question of fact. The doctrine of knowledge of the possession is based on the evidence available on record and judicial interpretation made by this Court and the High Courts over a period of times underscore the necessity of establishing this mental element after examination of the Crl. PLA Nos.537 559-2025 evidence available on record and only prosecution discharged the initial burden. The presumption arises and the defence has to discharge the same. The approach of this Court with respect to conscious knowledge of the possession somewhat sways but the dominance of the approach is that at bail stage, accused cannot be burdened with the total quantity recovered and is to be given the benefit of doubt for attributing him with only the quantity recovered from him or at his pointation. In case reported as Gul Manan Vs. The State 2021 SCMR 1804 , this Court observed that the question of whether an accused, not driving the vehicle, had conscious knowledge of concealed narcotics needs serious consideration and should be determined by the trial court after recording evidence and in such like circumstances, the case against the accused, calls for further inquiry under section 497 Cr.P.C. In case reported as Nazeem Ullah and others Vs. The State 2020 SCMR 356 , this Court granted bail while observing that the question of conscious knowledge or possession of the recovered narcotic substance should be determined at the time of trial. Likewise, in case reported as Anwar Khan and another Vs. The State 2006 SCMR 1343 , this Court observed that mere presence in the car, which belonged to son-in-law, was insufficient to prove conscious knowledge. 10. Thereis ample case law which deals with the fact that if circumstantial evidence is placed on record, then conscious knowledge is established, but all those cases are at bail stage, where only after the examination of the evidence, same has been held accordingly . 11. The crux of the above discussion and the case law on the subject is that at the stage of bail, unless there is confidence inspiring material available on record that each accused knew about the possession of the narcotic substance by the others, the total quantity cannot be attributed to every petitioner/accused separately and they are to be attributed with the quantity recovered from each petitioner/accused or on their pointation. Only after recording of the evidence and where the prosecution has proved that each individual/accused had conscious knowledge of the possession of narcotic substance or others, they can be implicated with the total quantity recovered. In the case in hand, there is nothing on record which shows that The State through Director ANF, Peshawar Vs. Rashmali Khan and others PLD 2016 Supreme Court 471 , Qaiserullah Vs. State 2009 SCMR 579 , Nadir Khan Vs. State 1988 SCMR 1899 , Muhammad Riaz and 2 others Vs. The State 2006 SCMR 1378 and Amanat Ali and 2 others Vs. The State 2008 SCMR 991 . Crl. PLA Nos.537 559-2025 petitioners are aware of the others possession of the narcotic substance, hence in the circumstances, they can only be implicated to the extent of narcotic substance recovered from their possession individually which weighs 1-kg each and punishment provided for the same in the Table contained in section 9 2 ibid is up to seven years, which does not fall within prohibitory clause of section 497 Cr.P.C. hence the law laid down by this Court in case reported as Tariq Bashir and 5-others Vs. The State PLD 1995 SC 34 supra is attracted in the present case. There is nothing on record which shows that the exceptions laid down in the referred case are attracted in the present case. In the referred case, it was observed by this Court that where the offence does not fall within prohibitory clause, grant of bail is a rule and refusal is an exception unless there are exceptional circumstances, which inter alia includes repetition of offence or abscontion. 12. An apprehension was expressed by learned Prosecutor General, ANF that one of the accused is an Afghan National and he may abscond, however, that per se is not a convincing ground for refusal of the bail. 13. For the above reasons, instant petitions are converted into appeals and are allowed; consequently, the petitioners are released on bail after arrest, in the above-mentioned case, subject to furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs.5,00,000/- by petitioner Muhammad Daud and Rs.2,00,000/- by petitioner Amanullah with one surety each in the like amount to the satisfaction of learned trial court. 14.

MALIK, J.- This Civil Petition is directed\nagainst order dated 27.02.2025 (Impugned Order) passed by the High\n\nCourt of Sindh, Circuit Court, Larkana (High Court) whereby the\nconstitution petition filed by Respondent No.1 (Respondent) was\ndisposed of.\n\n2. The basic facts are that the father of the Respondent was\nan employee of the Road and Transport Department, Government of\nSindh who died on 12.02.2002. His pension was originally sanctioned\nin the name of his widow, who died on 06.12.2012. Thereafter, the\nRespondent, being the unmarried daughter, sought the family pension\nof her father, which she received until she got married. The pension\nwas stopped on account of her marriage, however, upon dissolution of\nthe marriage in August 2022, the Respondent sought resumption of\nher father’s pension on the ground that she was the divorced daughter\nof a government employee, hence, entitled to his family pension. The\nPetitioners denied the Respondent grant of family pension by citing the\nWest Pakistan Civil Services Pension Rules, 1963 (Rules) and Circular\n\ndated 05.12.2022 issued by the Government of Sindh, Finance\n\nCPLA.616-K/2025 2\n\nDepartment (Circular)!, which provides that if the daughter of a\ndeceased pensioner is divorced at the time of death of the pensioner,\nshe is entitled to pension, however, if she gets divorced after the death\nof the pensioner, then she is not entitled to family pension. The\nRespondent challenged the refusal of grant of family pension by the\nPetitioners by way of a constitutional petition before the High Court\nwherein through the Impugned Order, she was granted the family\n\npension.\n\n3. Mr. Sibtain Mehmood, Additional Advocate General, Sindh\n(AAG) argued that on account of the Rules and the Circular, the\nRespondent is not entitled to pension as her divorce took place after\nthe death of her father and as per the Circular, since she was divorced\nafter the pensioner’s death, she is not entitled to family pension. He\nargued that as per the Circular, the daughter of a deceased pensioner\nis entitled to family pension based on her marital status at the time of\ndeath of the pensioner. Consequently, if she gets a divorce or becomes\nwidowed after the death of the pensioner, she is not entitled to family\npension. While relying on the Rules, he further argued that since the\nRespondent was originally married and then sought khula, she is not\nentitled to the pension in terms of Rule 4.10(3)(a) as family pension is\nnot payable to an unmarried daughter in the event of her marriage.\nThe basic requirement, he argued, is that she remains unmarried after\nthe death of the pensioner to qualify for family pension as per the\nRules. On hearing the arguments, the issue before us is the right of\nthe unmarried daughter or divorced daughter to claim family pension\n\nafter the death of her parent being a deceased government servant.\n\n4. We have heard the learned AAG and have examined the\nrecord. At the very outset, it is important to emphasize that pension is\nthe right of a government servant who has served the government for\na substantive period of time. It is not a charity, bounty, or ex gratia\npayment, but a legal entitlement that is granted in recognition of past\nservice.? It provides financial support in old age and reflects the State’s\nobligation to care for those who have served it. It cannot be reduced or\ndenied arbitrarily, and must be administered strictly in accordance\nwith law. This earned right passes onto the legal heirs of a deceased\n\ngovernment servant/pensioner which the legal heirs are entitled to\n\n' Circular No. FD(PCDC)3(225)/2022, Finance Department, Government of Sindh dated 5\" December, 2022.\n? Secretary, Government of Punjab v. M. Ismail Tayer (2014 SCMR 1336).\n\nCPLA.616-K/2025 3\n\nreceive in accordance with law. It is important to note that the flow of\nentitlement does not extinguish with the death of a pensioner rather it\ncrystalizes in favour of the legal heirs. The objective again being to\nprovide financial support to the family of the deceased civil servant.\nDelays in the disbursement of pensionary benefits to retired\nemployees, widows, or children are not only unlawful but amount to\ncriminal negligence and dereliction of duty.2 As part of the civil\nservant’s retirement benefits, pension gives rise to a legitimate\nexpectation and cannot be withheld except through lawful means.*\nThis Court has also held that the right of accrued pension is protected\nunder Article 9 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,\n1973 (Constitution) as part of the right to life. It is important to\nreiterate that the right to life does not merely include existence of the\nright to pension but includes the access to pension as the means\nnecessary for living with dignity. Therefore, it is the duty of the State\nand its departments to act with diligence and integrity and to ensure\nthe prompt and fair disbursement of pensionary benefits. Unwarranted\ndelays cause hardship and violate the trust placed in public\ninstitutions as retired government servants and their families are left\nwaiting for that which is lawfully due to them on account of\nbureaucratic negligence. Timely payment of pension is not simply an\n\nadministrative measure but a constitutional obligation.®\n\n5. The statutory framework is such that Section 20 of the\nSindh Civil Servants Act, 1973 (Act of 1973) provides that on\nretirement from service, a civil servant shall be entitled to receive such\npension or gratuity as may be prescribed. Subsection (2) thereof\nprovides that in the event of the death of a civil servant, whether before\nor after retirement, the family shall be entitled to receive such pension,\nor gratuity, or both, as may be prescribed. Consequently, the statutory\nright of pension is the right of the civil servant and in the event of\ndeath, this right devolves on the family of the deceased civil servant.\nThe Rules prescribe for the mode and manner in which pension is to\nbe granted. Rule 4.10 of the Rules provides for family pension but does\nnot define family, which is defined in Rule 4.7(1) which states that\nfamily, for the purposes of payment of gratuity, includes the wife (or\n\nwives) for a male government servant, husband of a female government\n\n3 Muhammad Ismail Memon: In the matter of Criminal Miscellaneous Application No. 226 of 2006 (PLD 2007 SC 35).\n\n4 Government of N.-W.F.P. v. Mohammad Said Khan (PLD 1973 SC 514) and I.A. Sharwani v. Government of Pakistan (1991\nSCMR 1041).\n\n5 Muhammad Yousaf v. Province of Sindh (2024 SCMR 1689).\n\nCPLA.616-K/2025 4\n\nservant, children of the government servant, the widow (or widows) and\nchildren of a deceased son of a government servant and a divorced\ndaughter and sister. As per Rule 4.10(2)(A), family pension is given to\nthe widow or widower of the deceased government servant and where\nthere is no widow or widower, as the case may be, pension is divided\nequally amongst the surviving sons who should not be older than 21\nyears of age® and unmarried daughters. In case family pension is not\ngranted under Rule 4.10(2)(A), then it may be granted under Rule\n4.10(2)(B) to the father or mother of the deceased government servant,\nas the case may be, and in the event that neither the father or mother\nare available, to the divorced daughter. Rule 4.10(3) provides that\nfamily pension shall not be payable to an unmarried female member of\nthe deceased pensioner’s family in the event of her marriage. The Rules\nmake it clear that family pension is granted to an unmarried daughter\nor a divorced daughter. Although both these terms are not defined in\nthe Rules, there is no apparent distinction between them, however, the\nmeaning attributed to the terms unmarried and divorced by the\nPetitioners is that an unmarried daughter is one who has never been\nmarried and a divorced daughter is one who was married and\nsubsequently divorced. However, we find that this distinction is simply\nin furtherance of the argument that as per Rule 4.10(3), family pension\n\nis not payable to the female member if she gets married.\n\n6. On 05.12.2022, the Secretary to the Government of Sindh,\nFinance Department, issued the Circular clarifying that in the case of\nthe surviving daughter of a deceased pensioner, she will be entitled for\nfamily pension if she is a widow at the time of death of the pensioner,\nor if she is divorced at the time of death of the pensioner. Accordingly,\nshe is not entitled to pension if she becomes a widow after the death\nof the pensioner or if she gets divorced after the death of the pensioner.\nIn this context, the Circular clarifies that in the event that the death of\nthe pensioner and of the husband of the daughter occurs on the same\nday, or similarly the divorce is on the same day as the death of the civil\nservant, family pension can be transferred to the daughter. Therefore,\nthe emphasis of the Circular is on the marital status of the daughter\nas on the date of the death of the pensioner. In other words, if the\nsurviving daughter becomes a widow or is divorced after the death of\n\nthe pensioner, then she is not entitled to family pension. Her\n\n6 Circular No. FD(SR-III)3-1165/2022, Finance Department, Government of Sindh dated 7th July, 2022.\n\nCPLA.616-K/2025 5\n\nentitlement, as per the Circular, is based on whether she is divorced\nor widowed on the date on which the pensioner dies. The entitlement\nis the status on the date of death of the pensioner. The Circular\nconditions entitlement to family pension for a daughter whether\nwidowed or divorced based on her status at the time of the pensioner’s\n\ndeath.\n\n7. In terms of the facts of this case, the status of the\nRespondent at the time of her father’s death was that she was\nunmarried, hence, entitled to and granted family pension which was\ndiscontinued on account of her marriage in 2022. After obtaining khula\nin 2022, she reclaimed her father’s pension as her status changed from\nunmarried daughter to divorced daughter. This was denied to her as\nshe obtained her divorce after her father’s death and therefore, she did\nnot qualify as per the Circular. We note that under the Rules, whether\nthe daughter is unmarried or divorced, she is entitled to the pension\nof the deceased civil servant in this case being the father’s family\npension. However, the Circular gives a narrow interpretation of Rule\n4.10(2)(B)(v)’ and (vi)® as it restricts the grant of pension to surviving\ndaughters of pensioners based on their marital status at the time of\ndeath of the pensioner. This is contrary to the right prescribed under\nthe Act of 1973 and the Rules which imposes no such condition. In our\nopinion, the Circular adopts an overly rigid approach making a\nwoman’s entitlement to family pension strictly contingent on whether\nher status as a widow or divorcee was established prior to or at the\nexact time of the pensioner’s death. Even a change in status occurring\na single day after the death of the pensioner is treated as a complete\nbar to family pension. The Circular therefore does not clarify Rule\n4.10(2) (A) or (B) but rather it imposes a condition of status at the time\nof death of the pensioner which is totally beyond the intent of the Act\nof 1973 and the Rules.\n\n8. It is settled law that executive clarifications in the form of\ncirculars and administrative directives cannot override, amend or\ncurtail the scope of the statute itself or the rules framed thereunder.\nIn the present case, the Circular modifies Rule 4.10 by imposing a\n\ncondition which is not authorized by the Act of 1973 or the Rules.\n\n7 (v) failing (i) to (v), to the eldest surviving widowed sister*[;] (since omitted by No. FD(SR-III)3-1165/2022, Finance\nDepartment, Government of Sindh dated 7th July, 2022).\n8 [(vi) failing the mother and the father, to the divorced daughter;]\n\nCPLA.616-K/2025 6\n\nConsequently, two distinct issues arise. The first being that the point\nin time restriction further limits eligibility to family pension with no\nstatutory backing because the Rules grant family pension to\nunmarried daughters and to divorced daughters, the distinction\nbetween the two being technical, possibly to avoid confusion, however\nthe basic issue being that the Rules do not condition this right with\nthe status at a given point in time requirement. The Circular places an\nonerous burden on the unmarried or divorced daughters’ right which\nis beyond the scope of the Act of 1973 and the Rules. The same will\napply to the widowed daughter, who as per the Circular, is only entitled\nto family pension if she was widowed before the pensioners death and\nnot after. The second issue is that the Finance Department has\ntransgressed its authority by issuing a clarification where none was\nrequired. It has in fact no authority to issue such a clarification and\nimpose conditions on the grant of pension which are not in the Act of\n1973 and the Rules which it seeks to clarify. A similar transgression\nwas in issue in the Kanwal Rashid case where this Court affirmed that\nfamily pension rights are an extension of the right to life under Article\n9 of the Constitution and that any denial of such rights must have a\nlegal basis, not a departmental policy or a circular?. While\nadministrative orders or executive instructions may fill in procedural\ndetails, they cannot nullify, override or contradict the Rules framed\nunder the parent statute.!° Consequently, the Finance Department\ncould not impose conditions on who qualifies for family pension, and\nit cannot restrict or exclude persons from a right given under the law\nby imposing conditions which are not envisioned under the statute or\nrules. It has been held by this Court time and again that pension is a\nlegal right and not a favour or benefit that can be changed at will.\nFurthermore, the right to pension has a constitutional underpinning\nbeing the fundamental right to life and dignity.1! We are dismayed to\nnote that, despite this Court having repeatedly clarified the legal\n\nposition, the law continues to be disregarded.\n\n9. Having said that, we also are of the opinion that in the\ncontext of family pension, it is deeply concerning that admissibility of\npension to a surviving daughter continues to depend entirely on her\n\nmarital status. This dependency model reveals that there is a\n\n° Province of Punjab v. Kanwal Rashid (2021 SCMR 730).\n!0Muhammad Amin Muhammad Bashir Ltd. V.

This assumption\nnot only perpetuates the stereotypical mindset about women being\ndependent members within the family structure but also fails to\nrecognize women as individuals or autonomous individuals who may\nhave the capacity to be financially independent. It is also based in the\nflawed belief that unmarried or divorced women are financially\ndependent, while married women are financially secure. This mindset\nfails to account for the fact that married women may also face financial\ndifficulty. It reflects a systematic bias that fails to recognize women as\nautonomous right-holders and also does not account for the lived\nrealities of women. It assumes, first and foremost that all women are\nfinancially dependent within the traditional family unit, from parents\nto husband and secondly that marriage per se ensures financial\nstability. It totally ignores the hardship and insecurities faced by\nmarried women who may be in need of the financial security in the\nform of pension. Dependency is not a metric for financial stability\nrather it is an assumption that disregards actual economic need and\nthe lived experiences of many women. The claim of surviving daughters\nshould be based on need and individual assessment rather than a legal\nframework built on patriarchal assumptions as to what is\nstereotypically believed to constitute dependency. This form\nof presumptive exclusion based solely on marital status is\nunconstitutional, discriminatory and a violation of Articles 14, 25, and\n27 of the Constitution. The concept of tying a daughter’s eligibility to\nfamily pension solely to her marital status results in an unjustifiable\n\ndistinction.\n\n10. Women are independent right-holders, autonomous and\nshould be entitled to family pension where financial need is\nestablished. Pakistan’s obligations under international law reinforce\nthe principle that women cannot be denied access to economic\nentitlements based on marital status alone. As a party to\nthe Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination\nAgainst Women (CEDAW), Pakistan is required to abolish\ndiscriminatory laws and practices that impair women’s enjoyment of\nrights on an equal footing with men. Article 13 thereof guarantees\nwomen equal rights in family benefits, while Article 2(f) obliges States\n\nto repeal existing laws and regulations that constitute discrimination.\n\nCPLA.616-K/2025 8\n\nArticle 5(a) requires the elimination of prejudices based on stereotyped\ngender roles, and Article 16(1)(c) recognises equal rights and\nresponsibilities within marriage and at its dissolution. Rules that deny\nwomen pension benefits based solely on marital status contradict\nthese obligations and reinforce assumptions that women must remain\nfinancially dependent and lack financial autonomy. In addition,\nPakistan is bound by the International Covenant on Civil and Political\nRights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social\nand Cultural Rights (ICESCR), both of which prohibit sex-based\ndiscrimination and require equal access to legal and social protections,\nincluding pensions. Goal 5 of the Sustainable Development Goals\n(SDGs) on gender further reinforce the obligation to eliminate legal and\neconomic barriers to women’s empowerment. Pakistan has also\nratified Convention No.111 of the International Labour Organization\n(ILO), which prohibits discrimination in employment and related\nbenefits, reinforcing the requirement that pensions be granted on\nequal terms, irrespective of sex or marital status. Despite the fact that\nthe Government claims its commitment under its international treaties\nand conventions, Pakistan’s standing in the Global Gender Gap Index\n(GGI) illustrates a different picture. The 2025 GGI ranks Pakistan at\n148 out of 148 countries globally and 143 out of 148 countries in\neconomic participation and opportunity. Indicators such as wage\nequality, labour force participation, and estimated earned income show\npersistent and wide disparities. Legal provisions that condition\npension access on status rather than need entrench these inequalities\nand contribute to the structural barriers women face in achieving\nfinancial security. A surviving daughter’s claim should be assessed on\nactual need and individual financial circumstances, not marital status.\nThis is the only way to ensure substantive equality so that we can\nfinally look beyond formal categories like married or unmarried and\ninstead consider the real-life impact of such classifications on women’s\nfinancial security. In contrast, India takes a more flexible approach\nbased on financial need. Daughters are granted pension based on need\nand not marital status. In fact, India also allows children with\ndisabilities to receive family pension for life based on their financial\nneed. Similar initiatives can be seen in Bangladesh through the use of\nsocial security schemes. It now allows pensions for widowed or\n\ndivorced daughters, and sometimes even for grandchildren who\n\nCPLA.616-K/2025 9\n\ndepend on the pensioner.!2 However, despite such development\nsurrounding pensionary frameworks in the Global South, the\nframework in Pakistan still remains rigid based on a deeply rooted\n\npatriarchal mindset.\n\n11. Upon a review of comparative jurisprudence, courts across\nvarious jurisdictions have consistently held that pension is a legal\nentitlement and must be administered in accordance with principles\nof equality and rational classification. Indian Courts have clarified that\nthe expression unmarried daughter must be interpreted broadly to\ninclude widowed and divorced daughters, and that such beneficiaries\ncannot be denied family pension solely on account of a change in\nmarital status.!5 It has been repeatedly reinforced that pension is a\nlegal entitlement, not a discretionary benefit that can be withheld\narbitrarily by the executive.!4 The Indian Supreme Court has further\nheld that pension is not solely a statutory right but the fulfilment of a\nconstitutional promise to the widow and dependents of a government\nservant. The rules governing such pensionary benefits exist to give\neffect to this constitutional mandate.!5 Similarly, in Carson v. United\nKingdom, the European Court of Human Rights recognized that social\nsecurity benefits must be distributed in a manner that is proportionate\nand non-discriminatory.!© These decisions further clarify that pension\nentitlements must be grounded in need and legal entitlement rather\n\nthan formal status or stereotypical assumptions.\n\n12. In view of the foregoing, it is important to revisit the law\nsurrounding pension. The Rules should be reconsidered to remove\nmarital status as a condition for entitlement. What we require is a need\nbased and dignity affirming framework. This approach would better\nalign with constitutional guarantees of equality and Pakistan’s\ninternational obligations to eliminate discrimination in access to social\nprotection. The existing framework is grounded in patriarchal\nassumptions and fails to treat women as autonomous rights-holders.\nBy tying a daughter’s right to pension to her marital status at the time\nof the pensioner’s death, the legal framework contemplates a criterion\n\nthat bears no rational connection to actual dependency.

            "CleanedText": "JUDGMENT AYESHA A. MALIK, J.- This Civil Petition is directed against order dated 27.02.2025 Impugned Order passed by the High Court of Sindh, Circuit Court, Larkana High Court whereby the constitution petition filed by Respondent No.1 Respondent was disposed of. 2. The basic facts are that the father of the Respondent was an employee of the Road and Transport Department, Government of Sindh who died on 12.02.2002. His pension was originally sanctioned in the name of his widow, who died on 06.12.2012. Thereafter, the Respondent, being the unmarried daughter, sought the family pension of her father, which she received until she got married. The pension was stopped on account of her marriage, however, upon dissolution of the marriage in August 2022, the Respondent sought resumption of her father s pension on the ground that she was the divorced daughter of a government employee, hence, entitled to his family pension. The Petitioners denied the Respondent grant of family pension by citing the West Pakistan Civil Services Pension Rules, 1963 Rules and Circular dated 05.12.2022 issued by the Government of Sindh, Finance CPLA.616-K/2025 2 Department Circular !, which provides that if the daughter of a deceased pensioner is divorced at the time of death of the pensioner, she is entitled to pension, however, if she gets divorced after the death of the pensioner, then she is not entitled to family pension. The Respondent challenged the refusal of grant of family pension by the Petitioners by way of a constitutional petition before the High Court wherein through the Impugned Order, she was granted the family pension. 3. Mr. Sibtain Mehmood, Additional Advocate General, Sindh AAG argued that on account of the Rules and the Circular, the Respondent is not entitled to pension as her divorce took place after the death of her father and as per the Circular, since she was divorced after the pensioner s death, she is not entitled to family pension. He argued that as per the Circular, the daughter of a deceased pensioner is entitled to family pension based on her marital status at the time of death of the pensioner. Consequently, if she gets a divorce or becomes widowed after the death of the pensioner, she is not entitled to family pension. While relying on the Rules, he further argued that since the Respondent was originally married and then sought khula, she is not entitled to the pension in terms of Rule 4.10 3 a as family pension is not payable to an unmarried daughter in the event of her marriage. The basic requirement, he argued, is that she remains unmarried after the death of the pensioner to qualify for family pension as per the Rules. On hearing the arguments, the issue before us is the right of the unmarried daughter or divorced daughter to claim family pension after the death of her parent being a deceased government servant. 4. We have heard the learned AAG and have examined the record. At the very outset, it is important to emphasize that pension is the right of a government servant who has served the government for a substantive period of time. It is not a charity, bounty, or ex gratia payment, but a legal entitlement that is granted in recognition of past service.? It provides financial support in old age and reflects the State s obligation to care for those who have served it. It cannot be reduced or denied arbitrarily, and must be administered strictly in accordance with law. This earned right passes onto the legal heirs of a deceased government servant/pensioner which the legal heirs are entitled to Circular No. FD PCDC 3 225 /2022, Finance Department, Government of Sindh dated 5 December, 2022. ? Secretary, Government of Punjab v. M. Ismail Tayer 2014 SCMR 1336 . CPLA.616-K/2025 3 receive in accordance with law. It is important to note that the flow of entitlement does not extinguish with the death of a pensioner rather it crystalizes in favour of the legal heirs. The objective again being to provide financial support to the family of the deceased civil servant. Delays in the disbursement of pensionary benefits to retired employees, widows, or children are not only unlawful but amount to criminal negligence and dereliction of duty.2 As part of the civil servant s retirement benefits, pension gives rise to a legitimate expectation and cannot be withheld except through lawful means. This Court has also held that the right of accrued pension is protected under Article 9 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 Constitution as part of the right to life. It is important to reiterate that the right to life does not merely include existence of the right to pension but includes the access to pension as the means necessary for living with dignity. Therefore, it is the duty of the State and its departments to act with diligence and integrity and to ensure the prompt and fair disbursement of pensionary benefits. Unwarranted delays cause hardship and violate the trust placed in public institutions as retired government servants and their families are left waiting for that which is lawfully due to them on account of bureaucratic negligence. Timely payment of pension is not simply an administrative measure but a constitutional obligation. 5. The statutory framework is such that Section 20 of the Sindh Civil Servants Act, 1973 Act of 1973 provides that on retirement from service, a civil servant shall be entitled to receive such pension or gratuity as may be prescribed. Subsection 2 thereof provides that in the event of the death of a civil servant, whether before or after retirement, the family shall be entitled to receive such pension, or gratuity, or both, as may be prescribed. Consequently, the statutory right of pension is the right of the civil servant and in the event of death, this right devolves on the family of the deceased civil servant. The Rules prescribe for the mode and manner in which pension is to be granted. Rule 4.10 of the Rules provides for family pension but does not define family, which is defined in Rule 4.7 1 which states that family, for the purposes of payment of gratuity, includes the wife or wives for a male government servant, husband of a female government 3 Muhammad Ismail Memon: In the matter of Criminal Miscellaneous Application No. 226 of 2006 PLD 2007 SC 35 . 4 Government of N.-W.F.P. v. Mohammad Said Khan PLD 1973 SC 514 and I.A. Sharwani v. Government of Pakistan 1991 SCMR 1041 . 5 Muhammad Yousaf v. Province of Sindh 2024 SCMR 1689 . CPLA.616-K/2025 4 servant, children of the government servant, the widow or widows and children of a deceased son of a government servant and a divorced daughter and sister. As per Rule 4.10 2 A , family pension is given to the widow or widower of the deceased government servant and where there is no widow or widower, as the case may be, pension is divided equally amongst the surviving sons who should not be older than 21 years of age and unmarried daughters. In case family pension is not granted under Rule 4.10 2 A , then it may be granted under Rule 4.10 2 B to the father or mother of the deceased government servant, as the case may be, and in the event that neither the father or mother are available, to the divorced daughter. Rule 4.10 3 provides that family pension shall not be payable to an unmarried female member of the deceased pensioner s family in the event of her marriage. The Rules make it clear that family pension is granted to an unmarried daughter or a divorced daughter. Although both these terms are not defined in the Rules, there is no apparent distinction between them, however, the meaning attributed to the terms unmarried and divorced by the Petitioners is that an unmarried daughter is one who has never been married and a divorced daughter is one who was married and subsequently divorced. However, we find that this distinction is simply in furtherance of the argument that as per Rule 4.10 3 , family pension is not payable to the female member if she gets married. 6. On 05.12.2022, the Secretary to the Government of Sindh, Finance Department, issued the Circular clarifying that in the case of the surviving daughter of a deceased pensioner, she will be entitled for family pension if she is a widow at the time of death of the pensioner, or if she is divorced at the time of death of the pensioner. Accordingly, she is not entitled to pension if she becomes a widow after the death of the pensioner or if she gets divorced after the death of the pensioner. In this context, the Circular clarifies that in the event that the death of the pensioner and of the husband of the daughter occurs on the same day, or similarly the divorce is on the same day as the death of the civil servant, family pension can be transferred to the daughter. Therefore, the emphasis of the Circular is on the marital status of the daughter as on the date of the death of the pensioner. In other words, if the surviving daughter becomes a widow or is divorced after the death of the pensioner, then she is not entitled to family pension. Her 6 Circular No. FD SR-III 3-1165/2022, Finance Department, Government of Sindh dated 7th July, 2022. CPLA.616-K/2025 5 entitlement, as per the Circular, is based on whether she is divorced or widowed on the date on which the pensioner dies. The entitlement is the status on the date of death of the pensioner. The Circular conditions entitlement to family pension for a daughter whether widowed or divorced based on her status at the time of the pensioner s death. 7. In terms of the facts of this case, the status of the Respondent at the time of her father s death was that she was unmarried, hence, entitled to and granted family pension which was discontinued on account of her marriage in 2022. After obtaining khula in 2022, she reclaimed her father s pension as her status changed from unmarried daughter to divorced daughter. This was denied to her as she obtained her divorce after her father s death and therefore, she did not qualify as per the Circular. We note that under the Rules, whether the daughter is unmarried or divorced, she is entitled to the pension of the deceased civil servant in this case being the father s family pension. However, the Circular gives a narrow interpretation of Rule 4.10 2 B v and vi as it restricts the grant of pension to surviving daughters of pensioners based on their marital status at the time of death of the pensioner. This is contrary to the right prescribed under the Act of 1973 and the Rules which imposes no such condition. In our opinion, the Circular adopts an overly rigid approach making a woman s entitlement to family pension strictly contingent on whether her status as a widow or divorcee was established prior to or at the exact time of the pensioner s death. Even a change in status occurring a single day after the death of the pensioner is treated as a complete bar to family pension. The Circular therefore does not clarify Rule 4.10 2 A or B but rather it imposes a condition of status at the time of death of the pensioner which is totally beyond the intent of the Act of 1973 and the Rules. 8. It is settled law that executive clarifications in the form of circulars and administrative directives cannot override, amend or curtail the scope of the statute itself or the rules framed thereunder. In the present case, the Circular modifies Rule 4.10 by imposing a condition which is not authorized by the Act of 1973 or the Rules. 7 v failing i to v , to the eldest surviving widowed sister ; since omitted by No. FD SR-III 3-1165/2022, Finance Department, Government of Sindh dated 7th July, 2022 . 8 vi failing the mother and the father, to the divorced daughter; CPLA.616-K/2025 6 Consequently, two distinct issues arise. The first being that the point in time restriction further limits eligibility to family pension with no statutory backing because the Rules grant family pension to unmarried daughters and to divorced daughters, the distinction between the two being technical, possibly to avoid confusion, however the basic issue being that the Rules do not condition this right with the status at a given point in time requirement. The Circular places an onerous burden on the unmarried or divorced daughters right which is beyond the scope of the Act of 1973 and the Rules. The same will apply to the widowed daughter, who as per the Circular, is only entitled to family pension if she was widowed before the pensioners death and not after. The second issue is that the Finance Department has transgressed its authority by issuing a clarification where none was required. It has in fact no authority to issue such a clarification and impose conditions on the grant of pension which are not in the Act of 1973 and the Rules which it seeks to clarify. A similar transgression was in issue in the Kanwal Rashid case where this Court affirmed that family pension rights are an extension of the right to life under Article 9 of the Constitution and that any denial of such rights must have a legal basis, not a departmental policy or a circular?. While administrative orders or executive instructions may fill in procedural details, they cannot nullify, override or contradict the Rules framed under the parent statute.! Consequently, the Finance Department could not impose conditions on who qualifies for family pension, and it cannot restrict or exclude persons from a right given under the law by imposing conditions which are not envisioned under the statute or rules. It has been held by this Court time and again that pension is a legal right and not a favour or benefit that can be changed at will. Furthermore, the right to pension has a constitutional underpinning being the fundamental right to life and dignity.1! We are dismayed to note that, despite this Court having repeatedly clarified the legal position, the law continues to be disregarded. 9. Having said that, we also are of the opinion that in the context of family pension, it is deeply concerning that admissibility of pension to a surviving daughter continues to depend entirely on her marital status. This dependency model reveals that there is a Province of Punjab v. Kanwal Rashid 2021 SCMR 730 . !0Muhammad Amin Muhammad Bashir Ltd. V. Government of Pakistan 2015 SCMR 630 . Articles 9 and 14 of the Constitution. CPLA.616-K/2025 7 systematic bias that treats a daughter as a dependent, with her financial dependency shifting from parent to spouse. This assumption not only perpetuates the stereotypical mindset about women being dependent members within the family structure but also fails to recognize women as individuals or autonomous individuals who may have the capacity to be financially independent. It is also based in the flawed belief that unmarried or divorced women are financially dependent, while married women are financially secure. This mindset fails to account for the fact that married women may also face financial difficulty. It reflects a systematic bias that fails to recognize women as autonomous right-holders and also does not account for the lived realities of women. It assumes, first and foremost that all women are financially dependent within the traditional family unit, from parents to husband and secondly that marriage per se ensures financial stability. It totally ignores the hardship and insecurities faced by married women who may be in need of the financial security in the form of pension. Dependency is not a metric for financial stability rather it is an assumption that disregards actual economic need and the lived experiences of many women. The claim of surviving daughters should be based on need and individual assessment rather than a legal framework built on patriarchal assumptions as to what is stereotypically believed to constitute dependency. This form of presumptive exclusion based solely on marital status is unconstitutional, discriminatory and a violation of Articles 14, 25, and 27 of the Constitution. The concept of tying a daughter s eligibility to family pension solely to her marital status results in an unjustifiable distinction. 10. Women are independent right-holders, autonomous and should be entitled to family pension where financial need is established. Pakistan s obligations under international law reinforce the principle that women cannot be denied access to economic entitlements based on marital status alone. As a party to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women CEDAW , Pakistan is required to abolish discriminatory laws and practices that impair women s enjoyment of rights on an equal footing with men. Article 13 thereof guarantees women equal rights in family benefits, while Article 2 f obliges States to repeal existing laws and regulations that constitute discrimination. CPLA.616-K/2025 8 Article 5 a requires the elimination of prejudices based on stereotyped gender roles, and Article 16 1 c recognises equal rights and responsibilities within marriage and at its dissolution. Rules that deny women pension benefits based solely on marital status contradict these obligations and reinforce assumptions that women must remain financially dependent and lack financial autonomy. In addition, Pakistan is bound by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ICCPR and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights ICESCR , both of which prohibit sex-based discrimination and require equal access to legal and social protections, including pensions. Goal 5 of the Sustainable Development Goals SDGs on gender further reinforce the obligation to eliminate legal and economic barriers to women s empowerment. Pakistan has also ratified Convention No.111 of the International Labour Organization ILO , which prohibits discrimination in employment and related benefits, reinforcing the requirement that pensions be granted on equal terms, irrespective of sex or marital status. Despite the fact that the Government claims its commitment under its international treaties and conventions, Pakistan s standing in the Global Gender Gap Index GGI illustrates a different picture. The 2025 GGI ranks Pakistan at 148 out of 148 countries globally and 143 out of 148 countries in economic participation and opportunity. Indicators such as wage equality, labour force participation, and estimated earned income show persistent and wide disparities. Legal provisions that condition pension access on status rather than need entrench these inequalities and contribute to the structural barriers women face in achieving financial security. A surviving daughter s claim should be assessed on actual need and individual financial circumstances, not marital status. This is the only way to ensure substantive equality so that we can finally look beyond formal categories like married or unmarried and instead consider the real-life impact of such classifications on women s financial security. In contrast, India takes a more flexible approach based on financial need. Daughters are granted pension based on need and not marital status. In fact, India also allows children with disabilities to receive family pension for life based on their financial need. Similar initiatives can be seen in Bangladesh through the use of social security schemes. It now allows pensions for widowed or divorced daughters, and sometimes even for grandchildren who CPLA.616-K/2025 9 depend on the pensioner.!2 However, despite such development surrounding pensionary frameworks in the Global South, the framework in Pakistan still remains rigid based on a deeply rooted patriarchal mindset. 11. Upon a review of comparative jurisprudence, courts across various jurisdictions have consistently held that pension is a legal entitlement and must be administered in accordance with principles of equality and rational classification. Indian Courts have clarified that the expression unmarried daughter must be interpreted broadly to include widowed and divorced daughters, and that such beneficiaries cannot be denied family pension solely on account of a change in marital status.!5 It has been repeatedly reinforced that pension is a legal entitlement, not a discretionary benefit that can be withheld arbitrarily by the executive.!4 The Indian Supreme Court has further held that pension is not solely a statutory right but the fulfilment of a constitutional promise to the widow and dependents of a government servant. The rules governing such pensionary benefits exist to give effect to this constitutional mandate.!5 Similarly, in Carson v. United Kingdom, the European Court of Human Rights recognized that social security benefits must be distributed in a manner that is proportionate and non-discriminatory.! These decisions further clarify that pension entitlements must be grounded in need and legal entitlement rather than formal status or stereotypical assumptions. 12. In view of the foregoing, it is important to revisit the law surrounding pension. The Rules should be reconsidered to remove marital status as a condition for entitlement. What we require is a need based and dignity affirming framework. This approach would better align with constitutional guarantees of equality and Pakistan s international obligations to eliminate discrimination in access to social protection. The existing framework is grounded in patriarchal assumptions and fails to treat women as autonomous rights-holders. By tying a daughter s right to pension to her marital status at the time of the pensioner s death, the legal framework contemplates a criterion that bears no rational connection to actual dependency.

                "The basic facts are that the father of the Respondent was an employee of the Road and Transport Department, Government of Sindh who died on 12.02.2002.",
                "His pension was originally sanctioned in the name of his widow, who died on 06.12.2012.",
                "Thereafter, the Respondent, being the unmarried daughter, sought the family pension of her father, which she received until she got married.",
                "The pension was stopped on account of her marriage, however, upon dissolution of the marriage in August 2022, the Respondent sought resumption of her father s pension on the ground that she was the divorced daughter of a government employee, hence, entitled to his family pension.",
                "The Petitioners denied the Respondent grant of family pension by citing the West Pakistan Civil Services Pension Rules, 1963 Rules and Circular dated 05.12.2022 issued by the Government of Sindh, Finance CPLA.616-K/2025 2 Department Circular !, which provides that if the daughter of a deceased pensioner is divorced at the time of death of the pensioner, she is entitled to pension, however, if she gets divorced after the death of the pensioner, then she is not entitled to family pension.",
                "The Respondent challenged the refusal of grant of family pension by the Petitioners by way of a constitutional petition before the High Court wherein through the Impugned Order, she was granted the family pension.",
                "Mr. Sibtain Mehmood, Additional Advocate General, Sindh AAG argued that on account of the Rules and the Circular, the Respondent is not entitled to pension as her divorce took place after the death of her father and as per the Circular, since she was divorced after the pensioner s death, she is not entitled to family pension.",
                "He argued that as per the Circular, the daughter of a deceased pensioner is entitled to family pension based on her marital status at the time of death of the pensioner.",
                "Consequently, if she gets a divorce or becomes widowed after the death of the pensioner, she is not entitled to family pension.",
                "While relying on the Rules, he further argued that since the Respondent was originally married and then sought khula, she is not entitled to the pension in terms of Rule 4.10 3 a as family pension is not payable to an unmarried daughter in the event of her marriage.",
                "The basic requirement, he argued, is that she remains unmarried after the death of the pensioner to qualify for family pension as per the Rules.",
                "On hearing the arguments, the issue before us is the right of the unmarried daughter or divorced daughter to claim family pension after the death of her parent being a deceased government servant.",
                "We have heard the learned AAG and have examined the record.",
                "At the very outset, it is important to emphasize that pension is the right of a government servant who has served the government for a substantive period of time.",
                "It is not a charity, bounty, or ex gratia payment, but a legal entitlement that is granted in recognition of past service.?",

                "The objective again being to provide financial support to the family of the deceased civil servant.",
                "Delays in the disbursement of pensionary benefits to retired employees, widows, or children are not only unlawful but amount to criminal negligence and dereliction of duty.2 As part of the civil servant s retirement benefits, pension gives rise to a legitimate expectation and cannot be withheld except through lawful means.",
                "This Court has also held that the right of accrued pension is protected under Article 9 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 Constitution as part of the right to life.",
                "It is important to reiterate that the right to life does not merely include existence of the right to pension but includes the access to pension as the means necessary for living with dignity.",
                "Therefore, it is the duty of the State and its departments to act with diligence and integrity and to ensure the prompt and fair disbursement of pensionary benefits.",
                "Unwarranted delays cause hardship and violate the trust placed in public institutions as retired government servants and their families are left waiting for that which is lawfully due to them on account of bureaucratic negligence.",

                "The statutory framework is such that Section 20 of the Sindh Civil Servants Act, 1973 Act of 1973 provides that on retirement from service, a civil servant shall be entitled to receive such pension or gratuity as may be prescribed.",

                "Rule 4.10 of the Rules provides for family pension but does not define family, which is defined in Rule 4.7 1 which states that family, for the purposes of payment of gratuity, includes the wife or wives for a male government servant, husband of a female government 3 Muhammad Ismail Memon: In the matter of Criminal Miscellaneous Application No. 226 of 2006 PLD 2007 SC 35 .",

                "As per Rule 4.10 2 A , family pension is given to the widow or widower of the deceased government servant and where there is no widow or widower, as the case may be, pension is divided equally amongst the surviving sons who should not be older than 21 years of age and unmarried daughters.",
                "In case family pension is not granted under Rule 4.10 2 A , then it may be granted under Rule 4.10 2 B to the father or mother of the deceased government servant, as the case may be, and in the event that neither the father or mother are available, to the divorced daughter.",
                "Rule 4.10 3 provides that family pension shall not be payable to an unmarried female member of the deceased pensioner s family in the event of her marriage.",
                "The Rules make it clear that family pension is granted to an unmarried daughter or a divorced daughter.",
                "Although both these terms are not defined in the Rules, there is no apparent distinction between them, however, the meaning attributed to the terms unmarried and divorced by the Petitioners is that an unmarried daughter is one who has never been married and a divorced daughter is one who was married and subsequently divorced.",
                "However, we find that this distinction is simply in furtherance of the argument that as per Rule 4.10 3 , family pension is not payable to the female member if she gets married.",
                "On 05.12.2022, the Secretary to the Government of Sindh, Finance Department, issued the Circular clarifying that in the case of the surviving daughter of a deceased pensioner, she will be entitled for family pension if she is a widow at the time of death of the pensioner, or if she is divorced at the time of death of the pensioner.",
                "Accordingly, she is not entitled to pension if she becomes a widow after the death of the pensioner or if she gets divorced after the death of the pensioner.",
                "In this context, the Circular clarifies that in the event that the death of the pensioner and of the husband of the daughter occurs on the same day, or similarly the divorce is on the same day as the death of the civil servant, family pension can be transferred to the daughter.",
                "Therefore, the emphasis of the Circular is on the marital status of the daughter as on the date of the death of the pensioner.",
                "In other words, if the surviving daughter becomes a widow or is divorced after the death of the pensioner, then she is not entitled to family pension.",
                "FD SR-III 3-1165/2022, Finance Department, Government of Sindh dated 7th July, 2022.",
                "CPLA.616-K/2025 5 entitlement, as per the Circular, is based on whether she is divorced or widowed on the date on which the pensioner dies.",
                "The entitlement is the status on the date of death of the pensioner.",
                "The Circular conditions entitlement to family pension for a daughter whether widowed or divorced based on her status at the time of the pensioner s death.",
                "In terms of the facts of this case, the status of the Respondent at the time of her father s death was that she was unmarried, hence, entitled to and granted family pension which was discontinued on account of her marriage in 2022.",
                "After obtaining khula in 2022, she reclaimed her father s pension as her status changed from unmarried daughter to divorced daughter.",
                "This was denied to her as she obtained her divorce after her father s death and therefore, she did not qualify as per the Circular.",
                "We note that under the Rules, whether the daughter is unmarried or divorced, she is entitled to the pension of the deceased civil servant in this case being the father s family pension.",
                "However, the Circular gives a narrow interpretation of Rule 4.10 2 B v and vi as it restricts the grant of pension to surviving daughters of pensioners based on their marital status at the time of death of the pensioner.",
                "This is contrary to the right prescribed under the Act of 1973 and the Rules which imposes no such condition.",
                "In our opinion, the Circular adopts an overly rigid approach making a woman s entitlement to family pension strictly contingent on whether her status as a widow or divorcee was established prior to or at the exact time of the pensioner s death.",
                "Even a change in status occurring a single day after the death of the pensioner is treated as a complete bar to family pension.",
                "The Circular therefore does not clarify Rule 4.10 2 A or B but rather it imposes a condition of status at the time of death of the pensioner which is totally beyond the intent of the Act of 1973 and the Rules.",
                "It is settled law that executive clarifications in the form of circulars and administrative directives cannot override, amend or curtail the scope of the statute itself or the rules framed thereunder.",
                "In the present case, the Circular modifies Rule 4.10 by imposing a condition which is not authorized by the Act of 1973 or the Rules.",

                "The first being that the point in time restriction further limits eligibility to family pension with no statutory backing because the Rules grant family pension to unmarried daughters and to divorced daughters, the distinction between the two being technical, possibly to avoid confusion, however the basic issue being that the Rules do not condition this right with the status at a given point in time requirement.",
                "The Circular places an onerous burden on the unmarried or divorced daughters right which is beyond the scope of the Act of 1973 and the Rules.",
                "The same will apply to the widowed daughter, who as per the Circular, is only entitled to family pension if she was widowed before the pensioners death and not after.",
                "The second issue is that the Finance Department has transgressed its authority by issuing a clarification where none was required.",
                "It has in fact no authority to issue such a clarification and impose conditions on the grant of pension which are not in the Act of 1973 and the Rules which it seeks to clarify.",
                "A similar transgression was in issue in the Kanwal Rashid case where this Court affirmed that family pension rights are an extension of the right to life under Article 9 of the Constitution and that any denial of such rights must have a legal basis, not a departmental policy or a circular?.",
                "While administrative orders or executive instructions may fill in procedural details, they cannot nullify, override or contradict the Rules framed under the parent statute.!",
                "Consequently, the Finance Department could not impose conditions on who qualifies for family pension, and it cannot restrict or exclude persons from a right given under the law by imposing conditions which are not envisioned under the statute or rules.",

According\nto learned counsel, since the ATIR did not record any finding with\nregard to non-compliance of the above provisions of the act therefore,\nthe learned Division Bench of the Lahore High Court was not justified\nto concur with the decision of the ATIR in instant case. It has been\nprayed by the learned counsel that the impugned order passed by the\nATIR and the Division Bench of Lahore High Court may be set aside\nand the questions proposed may be answered in favour of the\n\npetitioner and against the respondents.\n\n3: We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and\nperused the impugned order passed by the Division Bench Lahore\nHigh Court, Rawalpindi Bench, Rawalpindi in STR No.8/2024. The\nproceedings in the instant matter were initiated by Deputy\nCommissioner Inland Revenue Unit-IV Cantt Zone RTO, Rawalpindi\nvide show cause notice dated 10.08.2021 whereby, the respondents\nwere required to submit the record to prove as to whether the\npurchases made for the (Tax Period July 2019 to June 2020)\namounting to Rs. 323,722,601/- against which an amount of Rs.\n55,032,846/- was claimed as input tax, were actually made by them.\nIt was further alleged in the show cause notice that the record\nsubmitted by the respondents does not prove as to whether such\npurchases were actually made by the respondents during subject tax\nperiod, therefore, they have also failed to comply with the\nrequirements of Section 73 of the Act. It was concluded that\nrespondents did not purchase any coal from the local suppliers and\nunlawfully claimed input tax on the basis of fake/ flying invoices\nissued by the dubious suppliers, therefore, caused loss to the\nnational exchequer to the tune of Rs. 55,032,846/- by violating the\nprovisions 6,7,8,22,23,26 and 73 read with Section 2(37) of the Act.\nIn addition to hereinabove, respondents were also confronted as to\nwhy the default surcharge under Section 34, the penalty under\nSection 33 of the Act should not be recovered from the respondents.\nAs per record, the aforesaid show cause notice was duly responded\nby the respondents however, the reply furnished by the respondents\nwas not found satisfactory, and the Order-in-Original No. 33/100 of\n2023 dated 31.10.2022 was passed by the Assistant Commissioner\nInland Revenue Unit-IV Cantt Zone RTO, Rawalpindi whereby, the\n\nCivil Petition No.2336 of 2025 3\n\nrespondents were held liable to deposit an amount of Rs.\n55,032,846/- being inadmissible input tax, adjusted on the basis of\nfake/flying invoices, along with default surcharge and penalties in\n\nterm of Section 34 and 33 of the Act.\n\n4. Perusal of the Order-in-Original as referred to herein\nabove shows that the Assistant Commissioner Inland Revenue has\nduly acknowledged that respondents have produced record of sales\ntax withholding certificates, and the bank statement in respect of the\nsupplies made during the subject tax period, however, Assistant\nCommissioner Inland Revenue while discarding the aforesaid\nevidence, observed that since no evidence on purchases, physical\ntransfer book, delivery challan, bilty or payment proofs, except\nregister of payments to suppliers, were produced and most of the\npayments made to the supplier were over and above Rs. 50,000/-\ntherefore, on account of non-compliance of Section 73 of the Act, and\nin view of the fact that claim of input tax was based on fake/flying\ninvoices issued by the blacklisted units, therefore respondents\ncommitted tax fraud as defined under section 2 (37) of the Act. The\nabove Order-in-Original passed by the Assistant Commissioner\nInland Revenue was assailed by the respondents by filing an appeal\nunder Section 46 of the Act before the Commissioner Inland Revenue\n(Appeals-III, Islamabad) vide Sales Tax  Order-In-Appeal\nNo.380/2022-2023 dated 05.05.2023 was pleased to reject the said\nappeal for being devoid of any merits.

However, the said order was assailed by\nthe petitioner department before the Lahore High Court, Rawalpindi\nBench, Rawalpindi through STR No.8/2024 filed under Section 47 of\nthe Act who vide impugned order dated 26.03.2025 has been pleased\nto decide the reference application against the petitioner which has\nbeen assailed by the petitioner though above civil petition for leave to\nappeal in terms of Article 185(3) of the Constitution of Islamic\nRepublic of Pakistan, 1973.\n\nCivil Petition No.2336 of 2025 4\n\n5. It is pertinent to note that the proceedings in the instant\nmatter were initiated pursuant to issuance of show cause notice\ndated 10.08.2021 wherein the respondents were not confronted with\nany invoices, the value of which was above Rs. 50,000/- whereas, the\nmain allegation of the petitioner was that respondents did not\npurchase any coal from the local suppliers and unlawfully claimed\ninput tax to the tune of Rs. 55,032,846/- on the strength of\nfake/flying invoices issued by the suppliers who were blacklisted.\nHowever, no material or evidence whatsoever was provided to\nsubstantiate the allegation to the effect that the suppliers as\nmentioned in the show cause notice were blacklisted during the tax\nperiod under consideration, on the contrary, it has been recorded by\nthe ATIR that \"it has not been established by the department that the\ntransaction in question were executed during the period of suspension\nor blacklisting of the suppliers\". The Division Bench of Lahore High\nCourt, Rawalpindi Bench, Rawalpindi has concurred with aforesaid\nfinding of fact which could not be controverted by the petitioner\ndepartment.

In the case in hand, the show cause notice was\nissued in a mechanical manner. The allegations were vague\nand the facts had not been verified. Moreover, the taxpayer\nwas asked to establish that its suppliers ie. the eight\ndistinct entities had not made supplies and that they had\nnot deposited the output tax in the government treasury. It\nwas on this basis that it was presumed that the invoices\nwere fake/flying and thus the input tax adjusted against\nsuch invoices was alleged to be inadmissible. The taxpayer\nwas further asked to produce documents which were not\nrequired to be maintained under the Act of 1990 at the\nrelevant time. The department had issued a vague show\ncause notice pursuant to a report, without first making an\ninquiry of its own to verify the facts relating to the eight\nentities i.e whether they had deposited the tax in relation to\nthe supply made to the taxpayer. The High Court has\ncorrectly interpreted the provisions of the Act of 1990 in the\ncontext of the facts and circumstances of the case before us.\nThe appreciation of the provisions of the Act of 1990 by the\nHigh Court have been found to be unimpeachable. The\nDepartment has not been able to make out a case for grant\nof leave and, therefore, the petition is accordingly\ndismissed.\"\n\n6. The un-disputed facts and circumstances of the instant\ncase and the ratio of the cited judgment of this Court reflect that the\n\nshow cause notice and the Order-in-Original passed in the instant\n\nCivil Petition No.2336 of 2025 >\n\ncase, are based on vague and frivolous allegations and certain\nconclusions have been made on mere presumptions only, whereas, no\nmaterial or evidence has been produced to substantiate the same. We\nhave further noted that while passing the Order-in-Original, the\nAssistant Commissioner Inland Revenue exceeded his jurisdiction\nwhile traveling beyond the very premises and the allegations made in\nthe show cause notice whereas, the respondents were never\nconfronted with any such allegations or entries as reflected in the\nbank statement which were subsequently furnished by the\nrespondents, showing the details of the total amount and the\nparticulars of suppliers from whom purchases were made. It has been\nobserved that while initiating the proceedings against the\nrespondents, there was no material or evidence available on record to\nmake out a case against the respondents of illegal or inadmissible\nclaim of input tax adjustment, whereas, the entire proceedings and\nthe Order-in-Original passed in the instant case was based on\npresumptions, whereas, no inquiry or verification was made by the\ndepartment in respect of alleged fake/flying invoices. The ATIR and\nthe learned Division Bench of Lahore High Court, were justified to set\naside both the Order-in-Original and the Order-in-Appeal, while\nrecording concurrent findings on facts which does not suffer from any\nillegality or error. We are of the considered opinion that the impugned\norder does not give rise to any substantial question of law, and the\norder passed by the learned Division Bench of Lahore High Court,\nRawalpindi Bench, Rawalpindi does not suffer from any factual error\nor legal infirmity, hence does not require any interference by this\n\nCourt.

Mehnaz Begum and others\n...Respondent(s)\nFor the Petitioner(s): Mr. Muhammad Arif, ASC\n(via video link, Peshawar)\nFor the Respondent(s): Not represented\nDate of Hearing: 30.06.2025\nORDER\n\nYahya Afridi, CJ.- This petition of the petitioner-husband for\n\nleave to appeal is directed against the judgment of the learned High\nCourt, which, in affirming the concurrent findings of the courts\nbelow, allowed the claim for dower, dowry articles, and maintenance\n\nof the respondent-wife.\n\n2. Having perused the record and attended to the submissions\nof the learned counsel of the petitioner, this Court is not persuaded\nto grant leave. It is settled law that this Court will not disturb\nconcurrent findings of the courts below, save on grounds of legal\nerror apparent on the face of the record. No such grounds have been\nmade out here. The judgements of the learned courts below are all\n\nwell-reasoned, grounded in the record, and legally unassailable.\n\nCivil Petition No.354-P of 2025 --2:\n\n3. However, while the legal merits of the petition can be disposed\nof in the aforementioned terms, there remains an aspect of this case\nthat demands urgent attention of this Court. The observations in\n\nthis regard are recorded herein below.\n\nBackground:\n\n4. By way of necessary background, the petitioner-husband\n(“petitioner”) and the respondent-wife (“respondent”) were engaged\nin 2003, and their nikkah was solemnized in 2006. Not long after, in\n2007, the respondent was left at her parental home by the petitioner\nfollowing the alleged infliction of physical abuse on her person by\n\nthe petitioner.\n\n5. The petitioner then proceeded abroad, severed all contact with\nthe respondent, refused to provide maintenance, and essentially\nabandoned his wife within a year of marrying her. Three years after\nmarrying the respondent, he also contracted a second marriage, and\n\nhas two children from that union.\n\n6. Left with no other recourse, the respondent in 2015 initiated\na suit for recovery of her dower, dowry articles, and maintenance.\nThe petitioner, rather than contesting the claim of the respondent\non any credible ground, persisted in advancing a line of argument\nthat the respondent was medically unfit to perform conjugal rights\nand bear children, and hence disputed her status as a “female”\nunder the law, thereby seeking to deny her dower and maintenance\naltogether. While it is possible that the petitioner viewed this as a\n\ngenuine grievance or felt wronged in some manner, the manner in\n\nCivil Petition No.354-P of 2025\n\n-30-\n\nwhich this allegation, targeting the very identity of the respondent\nwas pursued remains troubling. It was pressed persistently and\naggressively through three tiers of judicial scrutiny, unnecessarily\nso given that all forums rendered findings effectively refuting it,\nthereby subjecting the respondent to what this Court recognizes as\n\nprofound personal humiliation.\n\nProceedings in the Courts below:\n\n8. For proper appreciation of how this line of allegation persisted\nthroughout the litigation, it is necessary to recount the way it was\nrepeatedly advanced before every forum, even though each Court\n\naddressed it and rendered findings intended to lay it to rest.\n\n9. At the trial Court level, the petitioner insisted upon pressing\nthe allegation that the respondent was not only medically unfit to\nbear children, but in fact, according to him, did not qualify as a\n“female” in legal terms, and was therefore, not entitled to dower or\nmaintenance. This allegation was not made in passing, but\nadvanced forcefully, as the primary defence, leading to the\nrespondent being subjected to medical examination by a standing\nmedical board as per the instructions of the trial court. The report\nof the standing medical board, although falling short of a fully\nconclusive determination, nonetheless expressly noted that the case\npresented as feminine, on the basis of which the trial court ruled in\n\nfavour of the respondent.\n\n10. When pushed at the District Court level, the learned District\n\nJudge, in addressing the aforesaid finding, rightly observed that\n\nCivil Petition No.354-P of 2025 -- 4 :-\n\nregardless of the medical report, the decisive element in determining\nentitlement to dower was the fact of consummation of marriage.\nThis, on evidence, stood fully proven as the parties had lived\ntogether as husband and wife for over a year and hence, the District\n\nCourt too ruled in favour of the respondent.\n\n11. Despite the clear and cogent reasoning, the petitioner deemed\nit reasonable to renew the same allegation before the learned High\nCourt and once again, at the zealous insistence of the petitioner\ncontesting her identity as a female, the respondent was directed to\n\nundergo yet another invasive medical examination.\n\n12. The resulting medical report from this second medical\nexamination was entirely conclusive and categorically affirmed that\nthe respondent is indeed a female. Out of respect for the dignity of\nthe respondent, and in recognition of the fact that unfortunately,\nshe has already been subjected to more than enough invasive and\ntraumatizing scrutiny in the course of this litigation, we consider it\nneither necessary nor appropriate to rehearse the contents of these\nmedical findings in detail. It is sufficient to note that nothing in this\nreport lends the slightest support to the allegations of the petitioner.\nIt has been confirmed, unequivocally, that the respondent is a\nfemale with no features or characteristics suggesting otherwise. As\nto the question of infertility, the report did not yield any conclusive\ndetermination, and the respondent declined further intrusive testing\nin this regard — a choice both lawful and eminently reasonable given\n\nthe trauma already inflicted upon her.\n\nCivil Petition No.354-P of 2025 = 5:-\n\n13. It is truly a travesty that despite the findings of the lower\ncourts, as reiterated above, the learned counsel for the petitioner\ndisplayed the audacity to try to press the same line of argument even\n\nbefore this Court.\n\nNecessary observations:\n\n14. This Court cannot but record in the strongest possible terms\nits disapproval of the manner in which the respondent —- a woman\nalready abandoned, denied maintenance, and left to the mercy of\nlitigation - was subjected to repeated, invasive, and demeaning\nscrutiny of her very personhood at the behest of a frivolous and cruel\n\ndefence.\n\n15. It is a sorrowful truth of our society that infertility, or even the\nsuspicion of it, is often weaponized against women. This social\nprejudice routinely results in courts of law becoming venues for\nhumiliating a woman under the guise of litigation. However, it must\nbe acknowledged without equivocation that infertility, even if\npresent, is no ground to deny a woman her dower or maintenance.\nIt is certainly no ground to challenge her womanhood. To convert\nsuch personal pain into a legal weapon is not only an abuse of the\n\nprocess, but an affront to human dignity that should not be enabled.\n\n16. It also bears emphasis that our religion and culture treat the\nmarital bond as a sacred covenant. The Holy Quran has described\nthe spouse as a garment; the relationship between a husband and\nwife is likened to that of libaas in our religion, and therefore, the\nideals of protection, mutual respect, and dignity in marriage must\n\nnot be compromised in any event.\n\nCivil Petition No.354-P of 2025 --6:-\n\n17. Lest we forget: women in our society constitute a vulnerable\ngroup, whose dignity requires vigilant protection and care. The\ncourts cannot, and will not, be passive venues for the perpetuation\nof social prejudices that harm women and subject them to one\ntrauma after the other. It is not a matter of judicial discretion but of\nconstitutional and moral obligation that the personal dignity of all\nwho appear before the courts be duly safeguarded, particularly\n\nwhere the power imbalance between the parties is so manifest.\n\nDisposition:\n\n18. The power to award exemplary costs is one means by which\nthe Court seeks to deter frivolous, abusive, and malicious litigation.\nIn the present case, the petitioner has not merely wasted judicial\ntime — he has caused a woman already in a position of vulnerability\nto suffer degradation and personal trauma over the course of\nprotracted litigation in three forums spread over a decade. This\nCourt would be remiss in its duty were it to allow such conduct to\n\npass without sanction.\n\n19. Accordingly, this petition is dismissed with costs of Rs.\n500,000/- (Rupees five hundred thousand only), imposed primarily\nas an expression of the strong disapproval of this Court towards the\nmisuse of judicial process by the petitioner to inflict gratuitous\nhumiliation upon the respondent, which shall be paid to the\nrespondent. If the said amount of costs is not paid by the petitioner,\n\nthe same shall be recovered by way of arrears of land revenue.\n\nCivil Petition No.354-P of 2025 = Tse\n\n20. Itis hoped that this order serves as a reminder to all litigants\nand counsel that the dignity of every individual, particularly of\nwomen, must be respected in all judicial proceedings. Frivolous\nallegations attacking the personal identity and dignity of a woman\n\nwill not be countenanced in any court of law.\n\n21. Office is directed to send a copy of this order to the respondent\n\nfor information.\n\nChief Justice\n\nJudge\n\nIslamabad, the\n30% of June, 2025\nApproved for reporting",

Nos.48-K to 51-K/2025\n\n2. According to the compendious facts narrated in the aforesaid\nCriminal Petitions, the petitioner before us, who is none other than\nthe Presiding Officer, Anti-Terrorism Court (“ATC”), Karachi, was\nappointed by the Government of Sindh for a tenure of two and a\nhalf years vide Notification dated 11.12.2023, which was issued\npursuant to Section 14 (2) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 (“ATA”).\nEarlier, the petitioner served in the subordinate judiciary and\nremained a District & Sessions Judge as well as the Additional\nJudge of the Sindh High Court. Besides performing the duties of\nPresiding Officer, ATC, the petitioner, vide Notification dated\n11.12.2023, was also designated as Administrative Judge, ATC,\nKarachi Division, thereby exercising administrative powers under\nSection 21-E read with Section 13(2) of the ATA. In his\nadministrative capacity, he was entrusted, inter alia, the powers\nrelating to remand and custody of accused persons involved in the\ncases registered under the ATA. The petitioner passed orders dated\n10.02.2025 and 11.02.2025 on the remand applications filed by\nthe Investigating Officer (“IO”) in Crime Nos. 01, 02, and 03 of PS\nAVCC/CIA and Crime No. 12 of 2025, lodged at PS Darakshan,\nKarachi, arising out of an incident involving an encounter between\npolice officials and Armaghan (accused). On 10.02.2025, the IO,\nproduced the accused before the petitioner, along with remand\napplications in respect of FIRs No. 01, 02, and 03 of 2025, wherein\npolice custody was sought for further interrogation and recovery of\nevidence. However, during the hearing, the accused complained of\nmaltreatment. Taking into consideration the complaint of\nmaltreatment as well as the medical report, the petitioner declined\npolice custody and remanded the accused to judicial custody (“JC”)\nvide the order dated 10.02.2025. On 11.02.2025, another\napplication for physical custody of the same accused was\npresented in Crime No. 12/2025 (kidnapping for ransom) but the\npetitioner ordered the constitution of a Joint Investigation Team\n(“JIT”) vide order dated 11.02.2025, to ensure investigation. Being\ndissatisfied with the orders dated 10.02.2025 and 11.02.2025, the\nState challenged the orders by means of Criminal Revision\nApplications No. 35 to 38 of 2025 in the High Court of Sindh,\nKarachi, which were heard and vide the consolidated impugned\norder, were set aside. The High Court also recorded certain adverse\nobservations and remarks implying judicial misconduct and\n\nprocedural improprieties on part of the petitioner, based on oral\n\n-3- Cr.P.L.A. Nos.48-K to 51-K/2025\n\nsubmissions of the prosecution, alleging the presence of the\naccused's father in the petitioner's chambers, creating a perception\nof impropriety, without giving the petitioner any opportunity\nwhatsoever to clarify or respond to such serious allegations.\nMoreover, the High Court also directed the Registrar to place the\nmatter before the Chief Justice and also referred the matter to the\nHome Department, Government of Sindh, and thereby implicitly\ninviting administrative action against the petitioner. As a\nconsequence thereof, the Government of Sindh issued a\nNotification on 26.02.2025, whereby the petitioner's administrative\npowers as Administrative Judge were withdrawn, which caused\nhim severe reputational harm and cast stigma on his lengthy and\n\nunblemished judicial career.\n\nTransfer Applications:\n\n3. Rather than moving on to the merits of the case, we would like\nto first take up and decide the Cr. Misc. Application Nos.102-K\nto _ 105-K/2025, filed by the Additional Prosecutor General,\nSindh/AOR, with the request to transfer the aforesaid Criminal\n\nPetitions to the Constitutional Bench of this Court. In order to\nunderstand whether the case is germane to the Constitutional\nBench or the Regular Bench, we invited him to explain how the\nmatter arising out of a consolidated impugned Order passed in\nCriminal Revisions by the learned Divisional Bench of the High\nCourt is required to be heard by the Constitutional Bench. It is\nwell-known that a new Article 191A has been inserted in the\nConstitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973,\n(“Constitution”) through the 26 Constitutional Amendment,\nwhich pertains to the Constitutional Benches of the Supreme\nCourt, with the rider that no Bench of the Supreme Court other\nthan a Constitutional Bench shall exercise (a) original jurisdiction\nof the Supreme Court under Article 184; (b) appellate jurisdiction\nof the Supreme Court under clause (3) of Article 185, where a\njudgment or order of a High Court passed under Article 199\ninvolves constitutionality of any law or a substantial question of\nlaw as to the interpretation of the Constitution; and (c) advisory\njurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 186. Both the\nlearned Additional Prosecutor General as well the Acting\nProsecutor General, Sindh, failed to satisfy us as to what\n\nsubstantial question of law, or constitutionality of law, or the\n\n-4- Cr.P.L.A. Nos.48-K to 51-K/2025\n\ninterpretation of the Constitution, is involved in the case at hand,\nwhich is required to be considered and decided by the\nConstitutional Bench of this Court under Article 191A of the\nConstitution. The matter simply relates to expunction of\nstricture/adverse remarks arising out of an order passed by the\nHigh Court while deciding the Criminal Revision applications, and\nhas got nothing to do with the taxonomy or genus of cases required\nto be dealt with within the framework of Article 191A of the\nConstitution. No plausible or convincing ground was raised before\nus. The transfer applications were found to be misconceived and\nfrivolous and while we were dismissing the aforesaid vexatious\napplications with cost, both the learned Additional Prosecutor\nGeneral and the Acting Prosecutor General, Sindh, argued that\nthey do not want to press Transfer Applications. Hence, at their\nrequest, the Cr. Misc. Application Nos.102-K to 105-K/2025 are\n\ndismissed.\n\nOn Merits:\n\n4. The learned counsel for the petitioner argued that the impugned\nOrder has unjustly cast a stigma upon the petitioner's judicial\ncareer which resulted in severe reputational harm and created an\nirreversible public perception. It was further argued that neither\nany right of audience was provided to him nor any\ncomments/report was called in response to the allegations made\nagainst him, which constitutes violation of the principles of natural\njustice and due process as enshrined under Article 10-A of the\nConstitution which is not confined to accused persons alone but\nextends to all individuals, including judicial officers, who may be\nadversely affected. It was further contended that while setting\naside the petitioner's orders, the High Court further directed that\nthe matter be placed before the Chief Justice and the Home\nDepartment, which created a presumption of wrongdoing without\nallowing the petitioner any opportunity to clarify his position.\nTherefore, the observations recorded in the impugned order are\nliable to be expunged, which were made without procedural\nfairness and irreversibly stigmatized the petitioner's judicial career,\nprofessional integrity, and public standing. He further argued that\nthe petitioner is no more interested in the revival of his charge of\nAdministrative Judge of the ATC, but he requests that the adverse\n\nremarks made in Paragraph No.14 of the impugned order may be\n\n-5- Cr.P.L.A. Nos.48-K to 51-K/2025\n\nexpunged without setting aside Notifications dated 26.02.2025 and\n27.02.2025.\n\n5. The learned Acting Prosecutor General admits that while\npassing strictures or adverse remarks, no notice was issued to the\npetitioner for calling his comments or his point of view, and he\nfurther argued that since the petitioner’s counsel categorically\nstated that the petitioner is not interested in the revival of his\nearlier notification as Administrative Judge, therefore, he has no\nobjection if adverse remarks are expunged without prejudice to his\nright to file a complaint, if any, in accordance with the law, to the\nActing Chief Justice/Chief Justice of the Sindh High Court on the\n\nadministrative side.\n\n6. Mr. Zain-ul-Abidin, learned counsel for the complainant, also\nendorsed his no objection to adverse remarks being expunged\nwithout upsetting the Notification dated 26.02.2025 and\n27.02.2025, issued for the appointment of some other judicial\nofficer as Administrative Judge, ATC.\n\n7. Heard the arguments. As far as the merits of the case are\nconcerned, the learned High Court, after jotting down certain facts\nof the case and discussing the relevant provisions germane to\nremand under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (“Cr.P.C.”),\nobserved that after lodging the FIRs, the accused was produced\nbefore the Administrative Judge, ATC, for remand in four cases\nunder Section 21-E of the ATA, which was declined by the\nAdministrative Judge on the ground that the accused complained\nof maltreatment. Therefore, he was remanded to judicial custody\nand the Administrative Judge also passed an order for constituting\nJIT in Crime No. 12 of 2005. Without a doubt, under Section 435\nread with Section 439 of the Cr.P.C., the High Court or any\nSessions Judge may call for an examination of the record of any\nproceeding before any inferior Criminal Court situated within the\nlocal limits of its or his jurisdiction for the purpose of satisfying,\nitself or himself as to the correctness, legality, or propriety of any\nfinding, sentence, or order recorded or passed, and as to the\nregularity of any proceedings of such inferior Court and may, when\ncalling for such record, direct that the execution of any sentence be\nsuspended and, if the accused is in confinement, that he be\n\nreleased on bail or on his own bond pending the examination of the\n\n-6- Cr.P.L.A. Nos.48-K to 51-K/2025\n\nrecord. The learned High Court after considering the pros and\ncons, observed that the Administrative Judge passed the order for\nremand of the accused but, afterward, through a correction\npen/whito, the order for “police custody” was swapped to “JC”. The\noral statement of the learned Acting Prosecutor General was also\nincorporated in the impugned order that “at the time of remand,\nthe father of the accused was sitting in the chamber of the\nAdministrative Judge for two hours, and it was subsequent act of\nthe latter, who changed his police custody remand orders in JC\nremand”. As far as the order passed for the constitution of a JIT by\nthe Administrative Judge is concerned, the learned High Court\nheld that under the law, no such powers are vested in an\nAdministrative Judge, as under Section 19(1) of the ATA, it is the\nprerogative of the Government, if it deems necessary, to constitute\n\na JIT.\n\n8. In a nutshell, while allowing all four Cr. Revision Applications,\nthe learned High Court set aside the impugned orders dated\n10.02.2025 and 11.02.2025 passed by the Administrative Judge\nand also issued directions to the Investigation Officer to produce\nthe accused before the Judge, ATC No.l], Karachi, for passing\norders afresh in accordance with law on all four Remand Reports\nunder Section 21-E of the ATA. In tandem, certain directions were\nalso issued under Paragraph No.14 of the impugned order, which\nis, for the ease of reference replicated as under:-\n\n“14. Before parting with this Order, it would be in the fitness of\n\nthe things to direct the learned Registrar of this Court to place\n\ncopy of this Order before the Honourable Acting Chief Justice,\n\nHigh Court of Sindh and Home Secretary, Government of Sindh\n\nfor passing appropriate order, if deem fit and proper in the\n\ncircumstances of the case, for withdrawing the power of\n\nAdministrative Judge for Anti-Terrorism Courts, Karachi Division,\n\nKarachi from the Court of Anti-Terrorism Court No. I, Karachi (by\n\ndesignation) and assign it to any other Anti-Terrorism Court of\n\nKarachi Division under section 13 (2) of the Act of 1997 in public\ninterest and administration of justice”.\n\n9. Judicial strictures must be passed with the greatest wariness\nand  circumspection because such condemnation and\ndenunciations have never-ending or interminable impact on the\ncredit of judicial officer. Rather, it always haunts him and causes\nsevere hardship and disparagement to his name and reputation in\njudicial service. It not only creates serious impairment and a sense\n\nof guilt in the eyes of his subordinates, but the confidence of the\n\n-7- Cr.P.L.A. Nos.48-K to 51-K/2025\n\npublic at large in the judicial system is also deteriorated. There is a\nworld of difference between a judicial stricture and a judicial\noutburst. The stricture figures in a considered judgment; the\noutburst is made during hearings of a case by a judge who is\nunable to control his tongue, restrain his anger, and curb his ego.\nOutbursts are sheer lapses in manners and taste and are soon\nforgotten. A_ stricture is remembered for long _ [Ref:\n\nfrontline.thehindu.com/the-nation/article].\n\n10. The rationale of affording a right of appeal, revision, or review\nin any statute or even in writ jurisdiction in the judicial hierarchy\nis meant to correct errors, slipups, and omissions crept up in\njudgments or orders rendered by the lower fora, which is based on\nthe philosophy inundated in the phrase that “to err is human”,\nwhich accentuates that it is quite natural and expected for people\nto make mistakes, which cannot be construed in all sets of\ncircumstances, either intentional or motivated by malice or due to\nsome extraneous considerations or recklessness but may also turn\nout to be due to human fallibility or inadequacy. It is very well said\nthat “a judge who has not committed any error is yet to be born.”\nFurther, “Superior Court Judges are to act as friend, philosopher,\nand guide of subordinate judges,” and “Judicial Officers deserve\nparent-like care from their High Courts” [Ref: Braj Kishore Thakur\nVs. Union of India & others (1997) 4 SCC 65 & (2001) 3 SCC 54].\n\n11. The illegality or irregularity in the order or judgment of a\nsubordinate court can be rectified by the appellate court, which is\nin fact the premeditated underlying principle for creating the right\nof appeal or revisions in the superior courts under different\nstatues. Another important aspect that cannot be lost sight of is\nthat a Judicial Officer against whom disparaging remarks or\nstrictures are passed cannot come to defend his own judgment or\norder; therefore, the High Courts should exercise greater caution\nand judicial restraint. Higher courts, on a daily basis, stumble\nupon judgments and orders of the lower courts, and if such\njudgments and orders are found to be deficient or flawed either in\nlaw or in fact, are modified, remanded, or set aside. This is\npredominantly the role and function of the superior courts as\nappellate/revisional courts. An improper motive should not be\nattributed even to a serious error committed by a judicial officer\n\nwithout confronting him and seeking his comments in order to\n\n-8- Cr.P.L.A. Nos.48-K to 51-K/2025\n\nmaintain judicial comity and discipline. While doing so, the High\nCourt should be mindful that the scornful and demeaning\nremarks/observations against a member of subordinate judiciary,\neven if expunged, would not totally restitute the defacement of\nesteem and dignity. The acid test is that criticism on a judgment or\norder must be judicial in nature, pointing out errors or flaws\nwithout deviating from temperance and equanimity. At the same\ntime, in case of any doubt regarding conduct, the matter may be\nsent through a separate confidential note for the attention of the\nChief Justice, who may then deal with the judicial officer in the\n\nexercise of his own fine sense of judgment.\n\n12. In our view, the High Courts should remember that\nreproaches/strictures and deprecations on judgments or orders of\nthe subordinate judiciary have many vulnerabilities; such as, the\njudicial officer is condemned unheard which is violative of the\nprinciples of natural justice. The principle of natural justice, due\nprocess, and fair play, and particularly the right to fair trial\nenvisaged as fundamental rights in the Constitution applies across\nthe board, including to judicial officers of subordinate judiciary,\nwho being a member of the subordinate judiciary. They, too, being\ndispensers of justice, should be granted the right to a fair trial,\nrather than being condemned unheard. A stricture contained in a\njudgment or order, whether reported in law journals or not, is a\nverdict in an open court which becomes public and remains so in\nperpetuity unless expunged by a superior court or by the Court\nitself. Therefore, any disapproval expressed should be couched in\ntemperate language, and before passing any stricture, at least\ncomments may be called confidentially so that the judicial officer\nmay not be condemned unheard and if the comments/report is not\nfound satisfactory, then the matter may be referred confidentially\n\nto the Chief Justice for consideration on the administrative side.\n\n13. In the case of Miss Nusrat Yasmin Vs. Registrar, Peshawar\n\nHigh Court, Peshawar_and others (PLD 2019 SC 719), while\n\ntaking into consideration local and foreign judgments on the\n\nissue/question of passing strictures by the High Courts, this Court\nheld that High Courts, while exercising constitutional, appellate, or\nrevisional jurisdiction under various laws, is to judicially examine\n\nand review the orders and judgments of the courts below on\n\n-9- Cr.P.L.A. Nos.48-K to 51-K/2025\n\nquestions of law and facts. What is under examination on the\njudicial side is the legal reasoning behind the order or the\njudgment. A Stricture recorded in a judgment, on the other hand,\nis \"a severe\" and a \"sharp criticism or a censorious remark\" and is\nakin to a \"piece of censure\" and passes for a \"critical remark\"\nregarding the conduct, integrity, diligence, behaviour,\ntemperament, and competence of a judge. The High Court, while\nperforming its judicial function, avoids passing strictures regarding\nthe ability, competence, integrity, and behaviour of the judge\nwhose judgment is under scrutiny before it. The High Court is not\nto assume the role of a critic of the personal attributes and abilities\nof a judge. However, in cases where a judge of the High Court\nespouses the view that a judge of the District Judiciary has\nexhibited grave incompetence or has misconducted himself in the\ndischarge of judicial duty and needs to be warned or proceeded\nagainst, the appropriate process is to inform the competent\nauthority on the administrative side through a confidential note\naddressed to the Chief Justice of the Court to take appropriate\naction. In the case of Aijaz Anmed Tunio Vs. The State (PLD 2021\nSC 752), this Court reiterated that the High Courts, under its\n\njudicial authority, should avoid passing strictures against a\njudicial officer of the District Judiciary, and any action, if at all\nwarranted must be done in accordance with law, by exercising the\nsupervisory control vested in the High Court. Whereas in the case\nof Hasnain Raza and another Vs. Lahore High Court, Lahore and\n\nothers (PLD 2022 Supreme Court 7), it was again held by this\n\nCourt that higher courts, every day, come across orders of the\nlower courts that are not justified either in law or in fact and\nmodify or set them aside; that is the function of an appellate court.\nThis applies to all judges, no matter how high or low in rank they\nmay be. The intemperate or extravagant criticism on the ability of a\nperson having a contrary view is often founded on one's sense of\nhis own infallibility. While examining the decision of a court below,\nthe higher court is to assess the reasoning and the legality of the\ndecision challenged before it and not the ability or conduct of the\n\nauthor judge.\n\n14. This Court in the aforesaid quoted judgments articulated well-\nstructured guidelines vis-d-vis mannerisms and outcome of\nstrictures against the sub-ordinate judiciary/judicial officers but\n\nunfortunately, the learned High Court while passing strictures did\n\n-10- Cr.P.L.A. Nos.48-K to 51-K/2025\n\nnot advert to the guiding principles explicated in the aforesaid\n\njudgments of this Court. In the case of Federation of Pakistan\n\nthrough Secretary, Ministry of Law and Justice Islamabad Vs.\nMuhammad Hamid Mughal (PLD 2024 SC 515 = 2023 SCP 293),\n\none of us, speaking for the bench, explained that the doctrine of\nStare Decisis is a Latin term that connotes “let the decision stand”\nor “to stand by things decided”, while another Latin maxim Stare\ndecisis et non quieta movere means ‘to stand by things decided and\nnot to disturb settled points’, These maxims represent an\nelementary canon of law that courts and judges should honour the\ndecisions of prior cases on the subject matter. This promotes\nharmony, uniformity, and practicality in legal interpretation. The\ndoctrine of binding precedent fosters firmness and uniformity and\nalso supports the development of law. According to the Treatise on\nthe Constitutional Limitation authored by Thomas M. Cooley, a\nsolemn decision upon a point of law arising in any given case\nbecomes an authority in similar cases, because it is the highest\nevidence which we can have of the law applicable to the subject,\nand the Judges are bound to follow that decision so long as it\nstands unreversed, unless it can be shown that the law was\nmisunderstood or misapplied in that particular case. If a decision\nhas been made upon solemn argument and mature deliberation,\nthe presumption is in favour of its correctness, and the community\nhas a right to regard it as a just declaration or exposition of the\nlaw, and are to regulate their actions and contracts by it. It would,\ntherefore, be extremely inconvenient to the public if precedents\nwere not duly regarded, and implicitly followed. The doctrine of\nprecedents and stare decisis, both have fundamental values\nengrained in our judicial system to ensure an objective of certitude\nand firmness. Judicial consistency advocates and encourages the\nconfidence in the judicial system and to achieve this consistency,\nthe Courts have evolved the aforesaid rules and principles which\nare grounded in public policy. In the case of Justice Khurshid\nAnwar Bhinder_and_ others Vs. Federation of Pakistan and\n\nanother (PLD 2010 SC 483), this Court held that where the\n\nSupreme Court deliberately, and with the intention of settling the\nlaw, pronounces upon a question of law, such pronouncement is\nlaw, declared by the Supreme Court within the meaning of Article\n189 and is binding on all the courts of Pakistan. It cannot be\n\ntreated as mere obiter dictum. It was further held that even obiter\n\n-11- Cr.P.L.A. Nos.48-K to 51-K/2025\n\ndictum enjoys a highly respected position as if “it contains a\ndefinite expression of the court’s view on a legal principle or the\n\nmeaning of law.”\n\n15. The petitioner, in the present case, only prayed for expunction\nof stricture, which has nothing to do with the merits of the decision\nof the High Court. In such situations, what this Court is required\nto evaluate is whether the passage complained of is reprehensible;\nits preservation on record will cause disparagement to the credit of\nthe petitioner; and its expunction will not affect the judgment or\norder on merits. In fact, Paragraph No.14 of the impugned order is\npredominantly based on the oral motion of the learned Acting\n\nProsecutor General, Sindh, in court, that the father of the accused\n\nwas sitting in the chamber of the Administrative Judge for two\n\nhours and it was the subsequent act of the latter to change it from\n\npolice custody to JC remand [emphasis supplied]. If the Acting\n\nProsecutor General, Sindh, was so confident that whatever he\nasserted was true and based on facts then such demur should\nhave been moved by dint of a written motion along with an\naffidavit, rather than levelling serious allegations orally.\nRegrettably, whatever he stated was taken and accepted as gospel\ntruth without verifying the authenticity of these serious\nallegations. Quite the reverse, what we feel forthrightly in our\nsagacity is that before passing any stricture on the demeanour and\ncareer of the petitioner, he should have given him an opportunity\nto submit his comments/report. However, in this case, no\nopportunity was provided to him by the learned Divisional Bench\nbefore passing the order in the Court. Even in the case of some\nlapses found to be surfaced on part of the judicial officer, the order\nor report may be sent to the Chief Justice for taking action on the\nadministrative side through the Confidential Branch. Therefore, we\nare of the firm view that the remarks/directions made in the\nParagraph No.14 of the impugned order which were essentially\nstructured on the oral motion of the learned Acting Prosecutor\nGeneral, Sindh, were unjustified, and without probing into the\nissue and without calling for comments from the Presiding Officer\n\nor without even affording him a right of audience.\n\n16. The ATCs are established under Section 13 of the ATA for the\npurpose of ensuring speedy trials of cases under the ATA and the\n\nscheduled offences. According to the precisions of sub-section (2)\n\n-12- Cr.P.L.A. Nos.48-K to 51-K/2025\n\nof Section 13, when more than one ATC is established in any area,\nthe Government, in consultation with the Chief Justice of the High\nCourt, is obligated to designate a judge of any such court to be an\nadministrative judge and all cases tried under the ATA pertaining\nto the said area shall be filed before the said court and such judge\nmay either try the case himself or assign any case or cases for trial\nto any other ATC at any time prior to the framing of the charge.\nVide Notifications dated 26.02.2025 and 27.02.2025, the\nAdministrative Judge has already been changed and the charge of\nAdministrative Judge has been assigned to some other judicial\nofficer. Mindful to the prevailing scenario, the learned counsel for\nthe petitioner unwaveringly conveyed that the petitioner is in fact\ninterested in and prayed for expunction of remarks only, but he is\nnot sentient or interested in the charge of Administrative Judge\n\nwhich has already been assigned to some other judicial officer.\n\n17. As a result of the above discussion, the aforesaid Criminal\nPetitions are converted into appeals. As a consequence thereof, and\nwithout disturbing or upsetting the Notifications dated 26.02.2025\nand 27.02.2025, issued for substituting/switching the command of\nAdministrative Judge, the remarks/directions contained in\n\nParagraph No.14 of the impugned order are expunged.\n\n18.

                "ORDER Yahya Afridi, CJ.- At the very outset, the petitioner, appearing in person, drew the attention of the Court to the fact that in an earlier petition, he had invoked the constitutional jurisdiction of the Lahore High Court, Lahore, the High Court challenging the registration of multiple FIRs and sought relief under Section 185 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 Cr.P.c.",
                "The petition was objected to by the Office, and the learned Bench of the High Court vide order dated 11.12.2024, maintained those objections.",
                "Aggrieved CPLA No. 2009 of 2025 -12:- thereby, the petitioner contends that he challenged the same before this Court through Civil Petition No.",
                "14 of 2025, which vide order dated 20.5.2025 remanded the case to the High Court for a decision afresh.",
                "Against this backdrop, the petitioner now contends that, he would be seriously prejudiced in view of the findings recorded in the impugned judgment.",
                "He further submitted that his claim for invoking positive jurisdiction of Section 185, Cr.P.C.",
                "has not been attended to in the impugned judgment, as the Court has restricted its findings only to the extent of the positive exercise of joinder of charge under Section 239, Cr.P.C.",
                "In response, the learned Special Prosecutor strongly objected to the contentions of the petitioner, arguing that the matter remanded by this Court in Civil Petition No. 14 of 2025 to the High Court was only to the extent of there being no reasons given by the High Court for maintaining the objections of the Office.",
                "He further submitted that the said order was solely confined to the question of the maintainability of the objections raised by the Office of the High Court, and not to the merits of the petition.",
                "He also objected that the very filing of the Writ Petition leading to the impugned judgment amounts to an admission on the part of the petitioner regarding sustaining of the objection raised by the Office in the earlier writ petition filed by the petitioner.",
                "And, finally, he contended that the issues involved in both these petitions are separate and distinct, applying to different circumstances.",
                "Without expressing any findings on the contested submissions of the parties or passing any definite view on the findings of the High Court recorded in the impugned judgment, it suffices to state that the same does not address the question of CPLA No. 2009 of 2025 -30applicability of section 185, Cr.P.C.",
                "to the case of the petitioner.",
                "Similarly, keeping the present petition pending would also lead to unnecessary multiplicity and prolongation of litigation.",
                "As far as the contention of the petitioner regarding the suspension of the subject trials before the Anti-Terrorism Courts in Faisalabad and Lahore till the final decision of the High Court in the remanded two petitions is concerned, the trials are to proceed in accordance with law.",
                "However, the matter relating to the suspension of the trials pending before the Anti-Terrorism Courts in Faisalabad and Lahore is to be decided by the High Court.",
                "We are sanguine that the High Court will proceed with the matter expeditiously without being influenced by any observations rendered herein by this Court and decide both petitions on their own merits.",
                "In view of the above, this petition is converted into appeal and partially allowed, and resultantly, the impugned judgment dated 20.03.2025 is set aside, and the matter is remanded to the High Court, where the Writ Petition No. 17090 of 2025 filed by the petitioner would be deemed pending and be decided along with Case Diary No.",
                "174515 of 2024, remanded by this Court vide order dated 20.05.2025 passed in Civil Petition No. 14 of 2025.",

Through the instant petition under Article 185(3) of the Constitution\nof Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, the petitioner-convict has\nquestioned his conviction and sentence.\n\n4. The prosecution's case as unfolded in the First Information Report\n(FIR) Exh.PA/1, registered on the basis of written complaint Exh.PA of\ncomplainant Muhammad Ijaz (PW.1) is that on 11.08.2018 at about noon,\nhis 10 years old daughter Shahida Bibi (PW.2), was told by their\nneighbor/accused Mst. Sajida Bibi (acquitted) to provide mobile phone\nnumber to the petitioner-convict Suleman at his residence situated near\nthe complainant's house, The minor Shahida Bibi went to the house of\nthe petitioner for handing over the mobile number and when she did not\nreturn home within a reasonable time, the complainant along with\nMuhammad Azhar and Muhammad Mazhar (PW.3) went to search for her\nat Suleman‘s residence. Upon arrival, they heard noises and cries coming\nfrom the petitioner's room. The complainant and his above name\ncompanions forcibly breakopen the door of the room and saw the\npetitioner committing rape of the minor. When the complainant tried to\noverpower him, the petitioner aimed his pistol at them -and made his\nescape good from the spot. The complainant shifted his minor daughter to\nhis house whereafter so many persons approached him on behalf of the\naccused and insisted not to initiate criminal proceedings against the\naccused. The complainant on finding an opportunity reached Police\nStation and lodged report on 12.08.2018 at 08.25 p.m,\n\nS. After a full dressed trial, the petitioner was convicted and sentenced\nunder Section 376(3) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) by the learned\nTrial Court and his conviction and sentence were upheld by the learned\nHigh Court by dismissing the petitioner's appeal through the impugned\njudgment.\n\n6. We have heard the arguments of the learned counsel for the petitioner\nas well as the learned Additional Prosecutor General Punjab, representing\nthe State and have carefully examined the record and evidence with their\n\nvaluable assistance.\n\nP.L.A. No. 297-L/ 202 * (Ox\n\n7. The instant matter concerns a juvenile accused, a boy of around13\nyears, whose age alone necessitates a more careful and compassionate.\nlegal lens. It is therefore appropriate to now undertake a structured\ndiscussion beginning with the juvenile justice legal framework operative\nin Pakistan, and to examine the merits of the present case side by side. It\nis not denied by the prosecution that on the date of occurrence, the\npetitioner had not attained the age of fourteen years. Historically, Section\n83 PPC exempts from criminal liability any child between the ages of\nseven and twelve who lacked sufficient maturity to understand the nature _\nand consequences of his act. However, pursuant to the Criminal Law\n(Second Amendment) Act, 2016, Section 83 PPC now reads as under:\n\n\"Nothing is an offence which is done by a child above ten\nyears of age and under fourteen, who has not attained\nsufficient maturity of understanding to judge of the nature and\nconsequences of his conduct on that occasion.\"\n\nThe: statutory prerequisites encapsulated in Section 83 PPC may thus be ©\nbifurcated into two distinct elements ;\n\n(i) The child's maturity of understanding to judge the \"nature\" of the act;\nand\n\n(ii) The child's maturity of understanding to judge the \"consequences of\nthe act committed. 2\nIn light of the principles of statutory interpretation, it is manifest that\nmere understanding of the nature of an act, unaccompanied by an\nappreciation of its consequences, does not suffice to establish criminal\nliability. It is common knowledge that a child might possess a basic\nawareness that certain acts are ‘wrong' or may lead to parental or social\n- disapproval. However, the term \"consequences of the act, as envisaged in\nSection 83 PPC, is to be interpreted not merely in terms of familial or\nsocietal effects but as encompassing knowledge that the act constitutes a\ncriminal offence and may attract penal consequences presctibed by law.\nIn order to ascertain whether a child offender possesses the requisite\nmaturity to understand the consequences of his act, it is imperative that\nthe Court assesses the cognitive abilities of the accused child. This\nrequires a meaningful inquiry into whether the child was aware that: \"the\nact he was committing was prohibited by law; and that “the act attracted\nspecific criminal penalties\". These considerations lie at the heart of the\nstatutory presumption of doli incapax a common law doctrine embedded.\nwithin Section 83 PPC. Unlike Section 82 PPC, which provides for an\nabsolute immunity for children under ten years of age, Section 83 PPC\n\nP.L.A. No. Lf 20: as : ca\n\nintroduces a rebuttable presumption of criminal incapacity for children\nbetween the ages of ten and fourteen years. It is incumbent upon the\nprosecution to rebut this presumption by establishing that, at the\nrelevant time, the child possessed sufficient maturity to understand both\nthe nature and the penal consequences of his conduct. As Thomas Crofts\n” cogently observes in his commentary, Rebutting the Presumption of Doli\nIncapax (1998) 62 JCL 185, it is insufficient for the prosecution merely to\nestablish the elements of actus reus and mens rea. Rather, the\nprosecution must go further and demonstrate that the child acted with a\nmischievous discretion, namely, an understanding that what he was\n_ doing was seriously wrong and not merely mischievous or childish in\n\nnature,\n\n8. The determination of \"sufficient maturity of understanding\" under\nSection 83 PPC has been left by the legislature to the sound discretion of :\nthe Court. However, it is regrettable that the law presently does not\nmandate the constitution of a psychological board or any other objective\n‘mechanism for evaluating the mental maturity of the child accused.\nConsequently, the ascertainment of a child's criminal capacity under\nSection 83 PPC rests solely upon judicial discretion, a matter that\ninevitably varies from case to case and which lacks standardized\nsafeguards. This judicial discretion, especially in cases involving offences\nthat attract severe sentences such as life imprisonment, must be\nexercised with utmost caution. In the absence of any expert psychological\nevaluation, the Court runs the risk of imposing punishment upon a\njuvenile in a manner contrary to both the domestic principles of juvenile\njustice and Pakistan's obligations under international law, particularly\nthe United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC),\nratified by Pakistan in 1990, In accordance with General Comment No. 24\n(2019) on children’s rights in the child justice system under UNCRC, the\nCommittee on the Rights of the Child has discussed documented evidence\nfrom the fields of child development and neuroscience which confirms\nthat children aged 12 to 13 years remain in a stage of significant cognitive\nand emotional maturation. Specifically, the frontal cortex that is\nresponsible for abstract reasoning, impulse control, and understanding\nlong-term consequences continues to develop during this period.\nAccordingly, such children may lack the requisite comprehension to fully\nappreciate the criminal nature of their actions.\n\nLP, . No. 297-L/ 20: lov\n\n9. The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, recognizes”\nthe special status of children. Article 25(2) empowers the State to enact\n\nspecial provisions for the protection of children. Article 35 imposes an\n\nobligation upon the State to protect the child, thereby underscoring the\n\nconstitutional ethos that children constitute a vulnerable class, deserving\n\nof particular care and protection. The principles embodied in the UNCRC,\n\nespecially its emphasis upon the child's right to harmonious development\n\nand the primacy of the child's best interests, reinforce the State's\n\nobligation to ensure a juvenile justice system that is not merely punitive\n\nbut reformative in its spirit and operation.\n\n10. The Juvenile Justice System Act, 2018 represents a vital legislative\n\neffort to bring into line Pakistan's juvenile justice framework with the ©\naforementioned international standards. Section 15 of the Act is .\nparticularly significant as it stipulates that no sentence of imprisonment\nmay be imposed upon a juvenile unless it carries with it the possibility of\nrelease, thereby rejecting retributive punishment in favour of a\n\nreformative approach.\n\n11. It is deeply alarming that in the instant case, no meaningful attempt\nwas made by the learned trial Court, the prosecution, or even the defence\nto assess the petitioner's level of maturity or to determine whether he fell\nwithin the exception provided by Section 83 PPC. No questions were\nposed to the petitioner to examine his cognitive awareness or\ncomprehension of the consequences of his act. Despite the gravity of the\noffence, a charge under Section 376 PPC, carrying life imprisonment, the\nlearned trial Court proceeded in a casual and mechanical manner. It is\nalso a disturbing and unfortunate revelation that the petitioner, a child of\nmerely around 13 years, was handcuffed while in custody. The act of\nrestraining a child in such a degrading manner not only undermines the\nlegislative intent of affording dignity and care to minors in conflict with\nthe law but also reflects a troubling disregard for the statutory safeguards\nspecifically.designed to protect their physical and psychological well-being.\n‘Astonishingly, the age of the petitioner was not recorded in the charge\nsheet. Age is-a crucial factor in assessing the reliability, credibility, and\nmaturity of a witness or accused, and its absence reflects a serious\nprocedural lapse. We deem it essential to reiterate that the recording of\nage is not a discretionary matter or a juvenile-specific safeguard alone,\nbut should be treated as a mandatory requirement that should be\nuniformly followed in all criminal proceedings. Police and Trial ‘courts .\n\n|. No. -L{ 2025 : jo?\n\nshall ensure that the age of the accused and all witnesses is to be duly\nrecorded at every relevant stage.\n\n12, Now coming towards the merits of the case. According to record the °\n\nalleged occurrence of committing rape with minor Shahida Bibi aged 10\nyears, took place on 11.08.2018 at noon time, inside a room in the\npetitioner's house which was reported by her father/complainant\nMuhammad Ijaz (PW.1) on the next day i.e. 12.08.2018 at 08.25 p.m. In\nhis report, the complainant has directly charged the petitioner for\ncommitting rape with her minor daughter. It is important to mention here\nthat if at the time of the alleged occurrence, the victim girl was 10 years\nold at the same time, the petitioner was also a child of 13 years of age.\n\nAccordingly, both, the victim and the petitioner were minors on the day of .\n\nthe alleged incident. In such a scenario where the case involves two\nchildren, it becomes imperative that the scales of justice are held in\ncareful balance. The appreciation of evidence must be carried out with\n\" utmost caution and sensitivity, ensuring that the rights and protections\nafforded to both minors under the law are not infringed.\n\n13. Complainant Muhammad Jjaz (PW.1) and his nephew Muhammad\nMazhar (PW.3), have furnished ocular account of the incident. According\nto their statements, on hue and cries of the minor victim, they attracted\nto the petitioner's house and when breakopen the door of the room, they\nsaw the petitioner committing rape of minor Shahida Bibi. They have\ndeposed that the petitioner while aiming his pistol at them made his\n\nescape good from the room/spot. As per statement of complainant he and ;\n\nPWs Muhammad Mazhar and Azhar did not chase the petitioner when he\nwas flecing away from the spot. Contrary, according to PW Muhammad\nMazhar, he along with others chased the petitioner for about 2/3 acres.\nThe account furnished by the aforementioned alleged eyewitnesses is\ndifficult to reconcile with the reasoning of a prudent mind. It is highly\nimprobable that a father, upon allegedly witnessing the commission of\nsuch a heinous act with his minor daughter would allow the culprit to\nescape unchallenged at any cost. The natural and expected humari\nreaction, particularly, from a parent in such a shocking situation would\nbe to dealt with the offender with an iron hand and attempt to apprehend\nhim even at the stake of his life. The alleged escape of the petitioner, a 13\nyears boy at the time of the incident, from three adult men present at the\n\nentrance of the room, strains credulity and does not appeal to a prudent ;\n\nmind. The conduct attributed to the eyewitnesses appears inconsistent\n\nrl. P. Lf 2: Jo¥ ,\n\nwith normal human behavior and raises serious doubts regarding their.\n\npresence at the spot at the time of occurrence and the veracity of their\naccounts. Furthermore, the statements of the alleged eyewitnesses,\nSpecifically concerning their arrival at the petitioner's residence in\nresponse to the victim's cries for help, are directly contradicted by the\ntestimony of the minor victim Shahida Bibi. According to her deposition,\nthe petitioner had forcefully covered her mouth with his hand when she\nwas taken into a room, thereby preventing her from miaking any noise or\nraising an alarm. No independent person from the petitioner's\nneighbourhood has been cited as witness to corroborate either the\npresence of the alleged eyewitnesses at the Spot at the time of occurrence\n\nor the occurrence of the offence. The absence of such impartial testimony °\n\nsignificantly further weakens the prosecution's case and calls into\nquestion the overall reliability of -the evidence produced by the\nprosecution.\n\n14. It is a well-settled principle of law that in cases of rape, the testimony\nof the victim is accorded significant weight, particularly when it is\ncorroborated by medical and forensic evidence. The alleged incident took\nplace on 11.08,2018, yet the medical examination of the victim was\nconducted approximately 30 hours later on 12.08.2018 without any\nexplanation by the prosecution. The testimony of Lady Dr, Sajida Anwar\n‘(PW-4), who medically examined the victim, delivers a serious blow to the\nProsecution's case, According to her she observed certain clinical signs\nsuch as fresh bleeding, hyperemia (redness due to increased blood flow),\nswelling in the genital area, and a torn hymen. However, she did not\nobserve any tears, bruises, lacerations, contusions, or other external\ninjuries that are typically expected in cases involving sexual assault of a\nminor, Furthermore, no injuries or marks of violence were found on any\nother part of the victim's body, which would normally be indicative of\nresistance or coercion. The investigating officer failed to take-into the\nbroken bolt of the room of the petitioner's house which according to the\n‘alleged eyewitnesses was present at the spot any blood-stained clothing of\nthe victim, particularly her trouser/Shalwar, which could have served as\nvital corroborative evidence. Moreover, forensic analysis conducted by the\n\nPunjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) revealed that no semen was -\n\ndetected on the vaginal swabs collected from the victim. The petitioner\nhas not been subjected to potency test. No doubt, the medical Officer\n(PW.9) who examined the petitioner has opined that petitioner was potent,\n\nGrl, PLA. No, 297-L/ 2025 JY\n\nhowever, without potency test, mere such opinion, particularly, when the\npetitioner was a minor boy at the time of occurrence would be sufficient.\nEven otherwise, in absence of any other credible evidence qua\ncommission of the rape with the victim by the petitioner, mere potency of\nthe petitioner would not be sufficient for the purpose of his conviction. No\npiece of circumstantial evidence has been taken into possession by the\nInvestigating Officer from the spot room. In light of these material\n\ncontradictions and omissions, the medical and forensic evidence fails to\n\nsubstantiate the prosecution's claim of rape.\n\n15. The above discussed contradictions, discrepancies and omissions\ncreate serious doubts in the prosecution's case and are sufficient for\nacquittal of the petitioner. The learned courts below by not appreciating\nthe evidence in its true perspective have fallen in error by holding the\npetitioner guilty of the offence. Mere heinous nature of an offence, if not\nproved through cogent and confidence inspiring evidence beyond\nreasonable doubt, cannot justify the conviction of an accused. It is a\nfoundational principle of criminal jurisprudence that it is preferable for\nmultiple guilty persons to go unpunished than for a single innocent\n\nperson to suffer a wrongful conviction.\n\n16. The Juvenile Justice System Act, 2018 is not a decorative piece of\nlegislation nor a token expression of legislative benevolence. It is a solemn\nstatutory commitment by the State to deal with juvenile offenders ina\nmanner that is child-sensitive, developmentally appropriate, and aimed at\nrehabilitation. It bears reiteration that children are not little adults.\nSubjecting them to adult punitive procedures undermines the very\nphilosophy of juvenile justice. It is paradoxical that a person deemed too\nimmature to vote or contract civil obligations may,nevertheless, be\nexposed to the full rigour of criminal prosecution and sentencing without\n\nany assessment of his mental maturity, It is, therefore, imperative that all: ”\n\nstakeholders, the judiciary, prosecution, defence counsel, and law\nenforcement agencies, give full and meaningful effect to the spirit and\nsafeguards enshrined in the JJSA, 2018, and the principles of Section 83\nPPC, Failure to do so risks not only a miscarriage of justice but also the\nerosion of society's collective commitment to the welfare and reform of its\n\nmost vulnerable members.\n\neae ln r,\n\nPLA.

Bail Application No.2690 of 2024)\n\nNoor Agha ...Petitioner\nVersus\nThe State and another ...Respondents\nFor the petitioner: Mr. Ali Wahid, Advocate High Court\n(with Court’s permission) (via video link from Karachi)\nFor the State: Ms. Rahat Ehsan, Additional Prosecutor General,\nSindh\n\nFor the complainant: Mr. Salahuddin Khan Gandapur, ASC\nMr. Ghulam Rasool Mangi, AOR\na/w Abdul Khanan\n\n(via video link from Karachi)\n\nDate of hearing: 15.04.2025\nORDER\nAthar Minallah, J.- Noor Agha (‘petitioner’) has sought leave\n\nagainst the impugned judgment of the High Court, dated 07.11.2024.\nHe had sought bail on the sole ground of statutory delay and it was\ndeclined by the trial court vide order dated 07.11.2024 and this order\nwas subsequently upheld by the High Court vide the impugned\n\njudgment.\n\n2. The petitioner was arrested in crime report No.200/22\nregistered at Police Station Sohrab Goth, District East, Karachi for\nthe commission of the alleged offences under sections 302, 365 and\n34 of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 (PPC’?. It is not disputed that\nthe petitioner was not nominated in the crime report. He was arrested\n\nunder section 54 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (‘Cr.P.C.’)\n\nCr.P.27-K/25\n\non 10.10.2022 along with another co-accused Muhammad Naseem. It\nwas alleged that the petitioner’s brother-in-law, namely, Wali\nMuhammad, who is also a co-accused in this case, had hired another\nperson to abduct Haji Hamidullah (‘victim’) who was later murdered.\nThe latter was alleged to have been abducted on 18.08.2022 and his\ndead body was found and recovered from the main road on the same\nday. The role attributed to the petitioner was that he had travelled to\nthe crime scene in a separate vehicle and that after his arrest he had\ndisclosed and led the police to the place of occurrence from where two\nspent bullets were recovered. The petitioner had sought bail on merit\nbut he could not succeed since his petitions were dismissed by the\ntrial court as well as by the High Court. He then filed a fresh petition\nseeking bail solely on statutory grounds which was also dismissed by\nthe trial court. The High Court, vide the impugned judgment,\ndeclined the bail on the sole ground that in its opinion the petitioner\nfell within the ambit of the expression ‘hardened, desperate or\ndangerous criminal’ which is incorporated as an exception under the\n4th proviso of sub-section (1) of section 497 Cr.P.C. However, it is not\ndisputed that the other conditions mentioned in the 3rd proviso are\n\nmet in this case.\n\n3. We have heard the learned counsels for the petitioner, the\ncomplainant and the Additional Prosecutor General at great length.\n\nWe have also perused the record with their able assistance\n\n4. The petitioner was arrested on 10.10.2022 for the commission\nof the alleged offences and one of the prescribed legal sentence is\ndeath. Admittedly, the petitioner has been detained for a continuous\nperiod which exceeds two years from the date of his arrest. It is also\nnot disputed that the delay in the conclusion of the trial is not\n\nattributed to the petitioner nor to an act or omission of any person\n\nCr.P.27-K/25\n\nacting on his behalf. The trial court and the High Court have declined\nthe bail on statutory grounds solely upon forming an opinion that the\npetitioner is a ‘hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal’. We have\nalso noted that this opinion has been mainly influenced by the\nnature of the offence. The prosecution did not place on record any\nmaterial other than the material collected during the investigation.\nThe prosecution had not placed before the trial court nor the High\nCourt sufficient material to enable them to form an opinion whether\nthe petitioner was a ‘hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal’. The\nrole attributed to the petitioner was no more than an alleged\nfacilitator, accomplice or being part of a conspiracy to commit the\nalleged crime. It is not the case of the prosecution that the petitioner\nhas a previous criminal record nor that his release could pose a\nthreat to others. It is also not the case of the prosecution that the\npetitioner, after release on bail, may harm others, repeat the offence\nor act in any manner which may be prejudicial to the peace of the\nsociety. Was it sufficient for the trial court and the High Court to\nform an opinion on the basis of the material collected during the\ninvestigation and the nature and the manner in which the offence\nwas alleged to have been committed? The only question for our\nconsideration is whether the High Court has correctly interpreted the\nexpression ‘hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal’ and has\nlawfully exercised its jurisdiction or not? The relevant provisions\nrequired to be interpreted need to be examined before the precedent\n\nlaw of this Court is surveyed.\n\n5. The 34 proviso to sub-section (1) of section 497 of the Cr.P.C.\ngoverns the statutory right to claim release on bail on the ground of\ndelay in the conclusion of trial. The legislature has explicitly used the\n\nexpression 'shall' in the 3'¢ proviso and it creates a right in favour of\n\nCr.P.27-K/25\n\nan accused to be released on bail provided the conditions stipulated\nfor claiming such a right have been fulfilled. The 34 proviso sets out\nthe conditions for being released on bail on the ground of statutory\ndelay. While the 4 proviso has described three distinct exceptions.\nEven if the conditions specified in the 3'¢ proviso are met but the\ncase falls in one of the exceptions set out in the 4 proviso, the\naccused would not be entitled to claim bail on statutory ground as of\nright. The right would come into existence if the conditions explicitly\nset out in the 3\"4 proviso have been met and the exceptions in the 4\nproviso are not attracted. The ground is solely based on the delay in\nconclusion of trial. If an accused has been alleged to have committed\nan offence punishable with death, e.g under section 302 (a) or (b) of\nthe PPC, then he or she becomes entitled to seek bail under the 3rd\nproviso if the detention is for a continuous period exceeding two years\nand, in the case of a woman, exceeding one year and the trial has not\nconcluded. The period of continuous detention prescribed for an\noffence not punishable with death is one year and for a woman it is\nsix months. The aforementioned delay must not be attributed to the\naccused nor to any act or omission of any other person acting on his\nor her behalf, as the case may be. However, the exception\nincorporated in the 4th proviso must not exist so that the right could\nbe exercised. The three exceptions are; if the accused is a previously\nconvicted offender for an offence punishable with death or\nimprisonment for life or 'in the opinion of the court' is a hardened,\ndesperate or dangerous criminal or is accused of an act of terrorism\npunishable with death or imprisonment for life. If one of the three\nexceptions stipulated in the 4» proviso is attracted then the right\ncontemplated in the 3 proviso could not be given effect to though\nthe delay may not be attributable to the accused and the prescribed\n\nperiod of detention has been completed. The 4 proviso is an\n\nCr.P.27-K/25\n\nexception and controls the bail granting power contemplated under\nthe 34 proviso. In this case, we are required to examine the scope\nand meaning of the expression “hardened, desperate or dangerous\ncriminal”. The other two exceptions are straight forward. The opinion\nregarding the expression has to be formed by the court. Is the court\nonly to confine itself to the material collected during investigation or\nmay also consider other material not related to the alleged offence\nbut which enables it to form an opinion whether an accused is a\n\nhardened, desperate or dangerous criminal\n\n6. The meaning and scope of the expression ‘hardened, desperate\nor dangerous criminal’ was considered by this Court in the case of\nMoundar!. It was held that the court has to form an opinion and\nsuch opinion could not be subjective but must be based upon\nmaterial placed before it which reasonably supports the conclusion\nthat the person concerned was a criminal of one of the classes\ndescribed in the expression. It was further held that the expression\n‘criminal’ used by the legislature in the 4th proviso could not be\nconstrued in its technical sense. It was not dependent on a formal\ncharge or accusation nor that the person should have been adjudged\nguilty of a charge in a court of law. It was further explained that the\nopinion could be formed on the basis of material available in the case\nbefore it, if that was sufficient, or it may also take into consideration\nany other material which may have been produced by the\nprosecution to enable the court in forming of the opinion regarding\nthe character of the person as a ‘hardened, desperate or dangerous\ncriminal’. Moreover, an opinion formed by the court for the purposes\nof the first proviso had nothing to do with the alternate findings of\n\nthe trial court and that the conclusion drawn for the purposes of bail\n\n' Moundar and others v. The State (PLD 1990 Supreme Court 934)\n\nCr.P.27-K/25\n\ncould not be used to the prejudice of the accused. The material\nplaced before the court was to be considered for the purposes of\ndetermining whether the accused was a criminal of the category\n\nexplicitly mentioned in the expression used in the 4 proviso.\n\n7. The above exposition of law regarding the meaning and scope of\nthe expression used in the 4t* proviso was reaffirmed by this Court in\nthe cases of Shakeel Shah and Allah Wasaya?2. The principles of law\nlaid down by this Court in the above-mentioned judgments were\nsummarized in the case of Nadeem Samson’, and the relevant portion\nis reproduced as follows:\n\n(i) The purpose and object of the 3rd proviso to Section\n497(1) CrPC is to ensure that the trial of an accused is\nconducted and concluded expeditiously, and that the\npre-conviction detention of an accused does not extend\nbeyond the period of two years in cases involving an\noffence punishable with death, or one year in other\ncases;\n\n(ii) The period of one year or two years, as the case\nmay be, for the conclusion of the trial begins from the\ndate of the detention of the accused in the case, not\nfrom the date when the charge is framed and trial\ncommenced;\n\n(iii) A statutory right to be released on bail accrues in\nfavour of the accused if his trial is not concluded\nwithin the specified period, i.e., exceeding one year or\ntwo years as the case may be, from the date of his\ndetention;\n\n(iv) This statutory right of the accused to be released\non bail is, however, subject to two exceptions: one is\nembodied in the 3rd proviso itself and the second is\nprovided in the 4th proviso, which are: (a) the delay in\nconclusion of the trial is occasioned by an act or\nomission of the accused or by any other person acting\non his behalf, and (b) the accused is a convicted\noffender for an offence punishable with death or\nimprisonment for life, or is in the opinion of the court\na hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal, or is\naccused of an act of terrorism punishable with death\nor imprisonment for life.\n\n? Shakeel Shah v. The State and others (2022 SCMR 1) and Allah Wasaya v. The State and others\n(PLD 2022 SC 541)\n3 Nadeem Samson v. The State and others (PLD 2022 SC 112)\n\nCr.P.27-K/25\n\n(v) The act or omission on the part of the accused to\ndelay the timely conclusion of the trial must be the\nresult of a visible concerted effort orchestrated by the\naccused. Merely some adjournments sought by the\ncounsel for the accused cannot be counted as an act\nor omission on behalf of the accused to delay the\nconclusion of the trial, unless the adjournments are\nsought without any sufficient cause on crucial\nhearings, i.e., the hearings fixed for examination or\ncross-examination of the prosecution witnesses, or the\nadjournments are repetitive reflecting a design or\npattern to consciously delay the conclusion of the trial;\nand\n\n(vi) The phrase “a hardened, desperate or dangerous\n\ncriminal” denotes an accused who is likely to seriously\n\ninjure and hurt others without caring for the\n\nconsequences of his violent act and will pose a serious\n\nthreat to the society if set free on bail. Such tentative\n\nfinding as to character of the accused must be based\n\nupon careful examination of the facts and\n\ncircumstances of the case, supported by sufficient\n\nincriminating material.\n8. It is noted that the scope and effect of the expression in the 4t»\nproviso i.e hardened, dangerous or desperate criminal is distinct from\nthe restriction on the power and discretion of a court under sub\nsection (1) of section 497 of the Cr.P.C not to release an accused on\nbail if there appears reasonable grounds for believing that the\naccused may be guilty of an offence punishable with death or\nimprisonment for life or for ten years. This distinction highlights that\nthe exception in the 4** proviso is not in the context of the merits of\nthe case i.e forming an opinion whether reasonable grounds exist for\nbelieving that an accused may have been guilty of one of the offences\nspecified by the legislature. Bail may have been declined on merits in\nterms of forming an opinion under sub section (1) of section 497 but\nif the conditions specified under the 3*¢ proviso are met and the case\ndoes not attract one of the exceptions specifically mentioned in the\n4th proviso then it entitles an accused to claim bail on the basis of\nstatutory delay as a fresh and independent ground. The exception of\n\nbeing a hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal contains four\n\ndistinct expressions. Hardened, desperate or dangerous' have been\n\nCr.P.27-K/25\n\nused by the legislature disjunctively and cannot be construed as\nconjunctive and they precede the expression 'criminal'. There must\nbe sufficient material placed before the court by the prosecution to\nenable it to form an opinion that if the accused is released on bail\nunder the 3\"¢ proviso, then there would be a substantial risk or it\nwould be highly probable that he or she would cause serious harm to\nthe society and its members because of being a hardened, dangerous\nor desperate criminal. An accused may not have been convicted in\nthe past and yet the court may form an opinion on the basis of\nsufficient material that the accused falls within one of the\naforementioned classes. An accused may have a previous conviction\nbut yet the court, on the basis of material placed before it, form an\nopinion that the accused does not fall within the meaning of the\nexpression of being a hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal.\nThe gravity of the crime alleged to have been committed by an\naccused could be a factor to be taken into consideration. There may\nbe material indicating the accused’s history of being involved in\nviolence and threatening witnesses, prosecutors etc. The prosecution\nmay place before the court material to demonstrably show that, if\nreleased, the accused could interfere with or influence the\ninvestigation by threatening or harming the witnesses or the\nmembers of law enforcement agencies. There could be several factors\nwhich the court may take into consideration in forming an opinion\nwhether an accused seeking bail under the 4* proviso is a hardened,\ndesperate or dangerous criminal. No general rule can be laid down as\nto how a court is to form an opinion because it would depend on the\nfacts and circumstances of each case. However, the opinion cannot\nbe based on mere presumptions, conjectures or subjective basis. The\ncourt essentially has to from an opinion that there is substantial risk\n\nor a real and high likelihood of harm to the society, if the accused is\n\nCr.P.27-K/25\n\nreleased on bail on statutory ground. This opinion must be based on\nthe material placed by the prosecution before the court. A history of\nbeing involved in violent crimes, disregard for humans or other living\nbeings, risk of abscondence and many other factors may enable the\ncourt to form an opinion. An accused suffering from a pedophilic\ndisorder, for example, would be a substantial risk leading to harm\nbut it would require an opinion of a medical practitioner so that the\ncourt may enable itself to form an opinion. The expression hardened,\ndesperate or dangerous criminal has a nexus with substantial risk\nand high likelihood of harm to the society or its members or a class\nof members and not to the merits of the case though that may also\nbe considered. The court must not exclude from consideration the\nprinciple that an accused is innocent until proven guilty and the\nright that accrues under the 34 proviso of section 497 (1) can only be\ndenied when the court, on the basis of material placed before it,\nforms an opinion that the accused would pose a substantial risk of\nharm to the society, public or its members, if released on bail. This\nopinion must be formed on the basis of credible material and not on\na subjective basis. The material may not be confined to the case\nbecause the prosecution has to show to the court that the accused\nseeking bail is not an ordinary criminal but a hardened, dangerous\nor desperate i.e someone who would be a substantial risk of causing\nharm to others and is a person who has disregard for the law and\n\nhuman life.\n\n9. In the case before us, the prosecution had not placed before\nthe trial court nor the High Court any material other than that which\nwas available in the case in which bail was sought on statutory\ngrounds. It is not disputed that the petitioner did not have any\n\ncriminal record nor was involved in any serious offence prior to his\n\nCr.P.27-K/25\n\narrest in this case. There was also no material to indicate that he had\nremained involved in committing violent acts or that there was a\nsubstantial risk that he would cause harm to the society or its\nmembers. Even in this case, it was not alleged that he had abducted\nthe victim nor that he had committed any violent acts or that his\nconduct in the past was also related to criminal violence. The only\nrole allegedly attributed to him was that he had travelled in a\ndifferent vehicle when the victim was taken to the crime scene and\nlater murdered. It appears that the High Court had formed the\nopinion merely on the basis of his alleged involvement in the offence\npunishable with death. In the facts and circumstances of this case,\nparticularly the material available on record, it could not have been\nconcluded that the petitioner was a ‘hardened, desperate or\ndangerous criminal’ in the context of the 4t proviso to section 497(1)\nof the Cr.P.C. Moreover, the learned Additional Prosecutor General\ncould not point out any material to suggest that the petitioner was a\nhardened, desperate or dangerous criminal and if released on bail he\nwould pose a substantial risk of harm to the society or its members.\nIt is also not the case of the prosecution that the petitioner has a\nhistory of threatening witnesses or members of the law enforcement\nagencies. It is also not disputed that the petitioner, after his arrest,\nhas remained incarcerated for a continuous period of more than two\nyears. The expression in the 4t proviso of section 497(1) of Cr.P.C.\nwas, therefore, not attracted and the statutory right under the 34\nproviso could not be withheld or denied. The petitioner was therefore,\nentitled to be set-free by granting him the statutory right on account\n\nof delay in the conclusion of trial not attributed to him.\n\nCr.P.27-K/25\n\n10. In view of the foregoing, the petition is converted into an appeal\nand the same is allowed by extending the statutory right of bail\n\nunder the 34 proviso of section 497(1) Cr.P.C.\n\n11. The above are the reasons for our short order of even date. It is\nnoted that any observation made in this order is on the basis of our\ntentative assessment of the record placed before us and, therefore, it\nshall not in any manner prejudice the proceedings pending before the\n\ncompetent court\n\nJudge\n\nJudge\n\nJudge\n\nIslamabad the\n\n15 April, 2025\n\nAPPROVED FOR REPORTING’\n(Aamir Sh.)",
            "CleanedText": "ORDER Athar Minallah, J.- Noor Agha petitioner has sought leave against the impugned judgment of the High Court, dated 07.11.2024. He had sought bail on the sole ground of statutory delay and it was declined by the trial court vide order dated 07.11.2024 and this order was subsequently upheld by the High Court vide the impugned judgment. 2. The petitioner was arrested in crime report No.200/22 registered at Police Station Sohrab Goth, District East, Karachi for the commission of the alleged offences under sections 302, 365 and 34 of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 PPC ?. It is not disputed that the petitioner was not nominated in the crime report. He was arrested under section 54 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 Cr.P.C. Cr.P.27-K/25 on 10.10.2022 along with another co-accused Muhammad Naseem. It was alleged that the petitioner s brother-in-law, namely, Wali Muhammad, who is also a co-accused in this case, had hired another person to abduct Haji Hamidullah victim who was later murdered. The latter was alleged to have been abducted on 18.08.2022 and his dead body was found and recovered from the main road on the same day. The role attributed to the petitioner was that he had travelled to the crime scene in a separate vehicle and that after his arrest he had disclosed and led the police to the place of occurrence from where two spent bullets were recovered. The petitioner had sought bail on merit but he could not succeed since his petitions were dismissed by the trial court as well as by the High Court. He then filed a fresh petition seeking bail solely on statutory grounds which was also dismissed by the trial court. The High Court, vide the impugned judgment, declined the bail on the sole ground that in its opinion the petitioner fell within the ambit of the expression hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal which is incorporated as an exception under the 4th proviso of sub-section 1 of section 497 Cr.P.C. However, it is not disputed that the other conditions mentioned in the 3rd proviso are met in this case. 3. We have heard the learned counsels for the petitioner, the complainant and the Additional Prosecutor General at great length. We have also perused the record with their able assistance 4. The petitioner was arrested on 10.10.2022 for the commission of the alleged offences and one of the prescribed legal sentence is death. Admittedly, the petitioner has been detained for a continuous period which exceeds two years from the date of his arrest. It is also not disputed that the delay in the conclusion of the trial is not attributed to the petitioner nor to an act or omission of any person Cr.P.27-K/25 acting on his behalf. The trial court and the High Court have declined the bail on statutory grounds solely upon forming an opinion that the petitioner is a hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal . We have also noted that this opinion has been mainly influenced by the nature of the offence. The prosecution did not place on record any material other than the material collected during the investigation. The prosecution had not placed before the trial court nor the High Court sufficient material to enable them to form an opinion whether the petitioner was a hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal . The role attributed to the petitioner was no more than an alleged facilitator, accomplice or being part of a conspiracy to commit the alleged crime. It is not the case of the prosecution that the petitioner has a previous criminal record nor that his release could pose a threat to others. It is also not the case of the prosecution that the petitioner, after release on bail, may harm others, repeat the offence or act in any manner which may be prejudicial to the peace of the society. Was it sufficient for the trial court and the High Court to form an opinion on the basis of the material collected during the investigation and the nature and the manner in which the offence was alleged to have been committed? The only question for our consideration is whether the High Court has correctly interpreted the expression hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal and has lawfully exercised its jurisdiction or not? The relevant provisions required to be interpreted need to be examined before the precedent law of this Court is surveyed. 5. The 34 proviso to sub-section 1 of section 497 of the Cr.P.C. governs the statutory right to claim release on bail on the ground of delay in the conclusion of trial. The legislature has explicitly used the expression shall in the 3 proviso and it creates a right in favour of Cr.P.27-K/25 an accused to be released on bail provided the conditions stipulated for claiming such a right have been fulfilled. The 34 proviso sets out the conditions for being released on bail on the ground of statutory delay. While the 4 proviso has described three distinct exceptions. Even if the conditions specified in the 3 proviso are met but the case falls in one of the exceptions set out in the 4 proviso, the accused would not be entitled to claim bail on statutory ground as of right. The right would come into existence if the conditions explicitly set out in the 3 4 proviso have been met and the exceptions in the 4 proviso are not attracted. The ground is solely based on the delay in conclusion of trial. If an accused has been alleged to have committed an offence punishable with death, e.g under section 302 a or b of the PPC, then he or she becomes entitled to seek bail under the 3rd proviso if the detention is for a continuous period exceeding two years and, in the case of a woman, exceeding one year and the trial has not concluded. The period of continuous detention prescribed for an offence not punishable with death is one year and for a woman it is six months. The aforementioned delay must not be attributed to the accused nor to any act or omission of any other person acting on his or her behalf, as the case may be. However, the exception incorporated in the 4th proviso must not exist so that the right could be exercised. The three exceptions are; if the accused is a previously convicted offender for an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life or in the opinion of the court is a hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal or is accused of an act of terrorism punishable with death or imprisonment for life. If one of the three exceptions stipulated in the 4 proviso is attracted then the right contemplated in the 3 proviso could not be given effect to though the delay may not be attributable to the accused and the prescribed period of detention has been completed. The 4 proviso is an Cr.P.27-K/25 exception and controls the bail granting power contemplated under the 34 proviso. In this case, we are required to examine the scope and meaning of the expression hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal . The other two exceptions are straight forward. The opinion regarding the expression has to be formed by the court. Is the court only to confine itself to the material collected during investigation or may also consider other material not related to the alleged offence but which enables it to form an opinion whether an accused is a hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal 6. The meaning and scope of the expression hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal was considered by this Court in the case of Moundar!. It was held that the court has to form an opinion and such opinion could not be subjective but must be based upon material placed before it which reasonably supports the conclusion that the person concerned was a criminal of one of the classes described in the expression. It was further held that the expression criminal used by the legislature in the 4th proviso could not be construed in its technical sense. It was not dependent on a formal charge or accusation nor that the person should have been adjudged guilty of a charge in a court of law. It was further explained that the opinion could be formed on the basis of material available in the case before it, if that was sufficient, or it may also take into consideration any other material which may have been produced by the prosecution to enable the court in forming of the opinion regarding the character of the person as a hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal . Moreover, an opinion formed by the court for the purposes of the first proviso had nothing to do with the alternate findings of the trial court and that the conclusion drawn for the purposes of bail Moundar and others v. The State PLD 1990 Supreme Court 934 Cr.P.27-K/25 could not be used to the prejudice of the accused. The material placed before the court was to be considered for the purposes of determining whether the accused was a criminal of the category explicitly mentioned in the expression used in the 4 proviso. 7. The above exposition of law regarding the meaning and scope of the expression used in the 4t proviso was reaffirmed by this Court in the cases of Shakeel Shah and Allah Wasaya?2. The principles of law laid down by this Court in the above-mentioned judgments were summarized in the case of Nadeem Samson , and the relevant portion is reproduced as follows: i The purpose and object of the 3rd proviso to Section 497 1 CrPC is to ensure that the trial of an accused is conducted and concluded expeditiously, and that the pre-conviction detention of an accused does not extend beyond the period of two years in cases involving an offence punishable with death, or one year in other cases; ii The period of one year or two years, as the case may be, for the conclusion of the trial begins from the date of the detention of the accused in the case, not from the date when the charge is framed and trial commenced; iii A statutory right to be released on bail accrues in favour of the accused if his trial is not concluded within the specified period, i.e., exceeding one year or two years as the case may be, from the date of his detention; iv This statutory right of the accused to be released on bail is, however, subject to two exceptions: one is embodied in the 3rd proviso itself and the second is provided in the 4th proviso, which are: a the delay in conclusion of the trial is occasioned by an act or omission of the accused or by any other person acting on his behalf, and b the accused is a convicted offender for an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life, or is in the opinion of the court a hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal, or is accused of an act of terrorism punishable with death or imprisonment for life. ?

Merely some adjournments sought by the counsel for the accused cannot be counted as an act or omission on behalf of the accused to delay the conclusion of the trial, unless the adjournments are sought without any sufficient cause on crucial hearings, i.e., the hearings fixed for examination or cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses, or the adjournments are repetitive reflecting a design or pattern to consciously delay the conclusion of the trial; and vi The phrase a hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal denotes an accused who is likely to seriously injure and hurt others without caring for the consequences of his violent act and will pose a serious threat to the society if set free on bail. Such tentative finding as to character of the accused must be based upon careful examination of the facts and circumstances of the case, supported by sufficient incriminating material. 8. It is noted that the scope and effect of the expression in the 4t proviso i.e hardened, dangerous or desperate criminal is distinct from the restriction on the power and discretion of a court under sub section 1 of section 497 of the Cr.P.C not to release an accused on bail if there appears reasonable grounds for believing that the accused may be guilty of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life or for ten years. This distinction highlights that the exception in the 4 proviso is not in the context of the merits of the case i.e forming an opinion whether reasonable grounds exist for believing that an accused may have been guilty of one of the offences specified by the legislature. Bail may have been declined on merits in terms of forming an opinion under sub section 1 of section 497 but if the conditions specified under the 3 proviso are met and the case does not attract one of the exceptions specifically mentioned in the 4th proviso then it entitles an accused to claim bail on the basis of statutory delay as a fresh and independent ground. The exception of being a hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal contains four distinct expressions. Hardened, desperate or dangerous have been Cr.P.27-K/25 used by the legislature disjunctively and cannot be construed as conjunctive and they precede the expression criminal . There must be sufficient material placed before the court by the prosecution to enable it to form an opinion that if the accused is released on bail under the 3 proviso, then there would be a substantial risk or it would be highly probable that he or she would cause serious harm to the society and its members because of being a hardened, dangerous or desperate criminal. An accused may not have been convicted in the past and yet the court may form an opinion on the basis of sufficient material that the accused falls within one of the aforementioned classes. An accused may have a previous conviction but yet the court, on the basis of material placed before it, form an opinion that the accused does not fall within the meaning of the expression of being a hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal. The gravity of the crime alleged to have been committed by an accused could be a factor to be taken into consideration. There may be material indicating the accused s history of being involved in violence and threatening witnesses, prosecutors etc. The prosecution may place before the court material to demonstrably show that, if released, the accused could interfere with or influence the investigation by threatening or harming the witnesses or the members of law enforcement agencies. There could be several factors which the court may take into consideration in forming an opinion whether an accused seeking bail under the 4 proviso is a hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal. No general rule can be laid down as to how a court is to form an opinion because it would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. However, the opinion cannot be based on mere presumptions, conjectures or subjective basis. The court essentially has to from an opinion that there is substantial risk or a real and high likelihood of harm to the society, if the accused is Cr.P.27-K/25 released on bail on statutory ground. This opinion must be based on the material placed by the prosecution before the court. A history of being involved in violent crimes, disregard for humans or other living beings, risk of abscondence and many other factors may enable the court to form an opinion. An accused suffering from a pedophilic disorder, for example, would be a substantial risk leading to harm but it would require an opinion of a medical practitioner so that the court may enable itself to form an opinion. The expression hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal has a nexus with substantial risk and high likelihood of harm to the society or its members or a class of members and not to the merits of the case though that may also be considered. The court must not exclude from consideration the principle that an accused is innocent until proven guilty and the right that accrues under the 34 proviso of section 497 1 can only be denied when the court, on the basis of material placed before it, forms an opinion that the accused would pose a substantial risk of harm to the society, public or its members, if released on bail. This opinion must be formed on the basis of credible material and not on a subjective basis. The material may not be confined to the case because the prosecution has to show to the court that the accused seeking bail is not an ordinary criminal but a hardened, dangerous or desperate i.e someone who would be a substantial risk of causing harm to others and is a person who has disregard for the law and human life. 9. In the case before us, the prosecution had not placed before the trial court nor the High Court any material other than that which was available in the case in which bail was sought on statutory grounds. It is not disputed that the petitioner did not have any criminal record nor was involved in any serious offence prior to his Cr.P.27-K/25 arrest in this case. There was also no material to indicate that he had remained involved in committing violent acts or that there was a substantial risk that he would cause harm to the society or its members. Even in this case, it was not alleged that he had abducted the victim nor that he had committed any violent acts or that his conduct in the past was also related to criminal violence. The only role allegedly attributed to him was that he had travelled in a different vehicle when the victim was taken to the crime scene and later murdered. It appears that the High Court had formed the opinion merely on the basis of his alleged involvement in the offence punishable with death. In the facts and circumstances of this case, particularly the material available on record, it could not have been concluded that the petitioner was a hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal in the context of the 4t proviso to section 497 1 of the Cr.P.C. Moreover, the learned Additional Prosecutor General could not point out any material to suggest that the petitioner was a hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal and if released on bail he would pose a substantial risk of harm to the society or its members. It is also not the case of the prosecution that the petitioner has a history of threatening witnesses or members of the law enforcement agencies. It is also not disputed that the petitioner, after his arrest, has remained incarcerated for a continuous period of more than two years. The expression in the 4t proviso of section 497 1 of Cr.P.C. was, therefore, not attracted and the statutory right under the 34 proviso could not be withheld or denied. The petitioner was therefore, entitled to be set-free by granting him the statutory right on account of delay in the conclusion of trial not attributed to him. Cr.P.27-K/25 10. In view of the foregoing, the petition is converted into an appeal and the same is allowed by extending the statutory right of bail under the 34 proviso of section 497 1 Cr.P.C. 11. The above are the reasons for our short order of even date. It is noted that any observation made in this order is on the basis of our tentative assessment of the record placed before us and, therefore, it shall not in any manner prejudice the proceedings pending before the competent court Judge Judge Judge Islamabad the 15 April, 2025 APPROVED FOR REPORTING Aamir Sh.",

                "Was it sufficient for the trial court and the High Court to form an opinion on the basis of the material collected during the investigation and the nature and the manner in which the offence was alleged to have been committed?",
                "The only question for our consideration is whether the High Court has correctly interpreted the expression hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal and has lawfully exercised its jurisdiction or not?",

                "The 34 proviso to sub-section 1 of section 497 of the Cr.P.C.",
                "governs the statutory right to claim release on bail on the ground of delay in the conclusion of trial.",

                "The 34 proviso sets out the conditions for being released on bail on the ground of statutory delay.",

                "It was held that the court has to form an opinion and such opinion could not be subjective but must be based upon material placed before it which reasonably supports the conclusion that the person concerned was a criminal of one of the classes described in the expression.",
                "It was further held that the expression criminal used by the legislature in the 4th proviso could not be construed in its technical sense.",
                "It was not dependent on a formal charge or accusation nor that the person should have been adjudged guilty of a charge in a court of law.",
                "It was further explained that the opinion could be formed on the basis of material available in the case before it, if that was sufficient, or it may also take into consideration any other material which may have been produced by the prosecution to enable the court in forming of the opinion regarding the character of the person as a hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal .",
                "Moreover, an opinion formed by the court for the purposes of the first proviso had nothing to do with the alternate findings of the trial court and that the conclusion drawn for the purposes of bail Moundar and others v. The State PLD 1990 Supreme Court 934 Cr.P.27-K/25 could not be used to the prejudice of the accused.",
                "The material placed before the court was to be considered for the purposes of determining whether the accused was a criminal of the category explicitly mentioned in the expression used in the 4 proviso.",
                "The above exposition of law regarding the meaning and scope of the expression used in the 4t proviso was reaffirmed by this Court in the cases of Shakeel Shah and Allah Wasaya?2.",
                "The principles of law laid down by this Court in the above-mentioned judgments were summarized in the case of Nadeem Samson , and the relevant portion is reproduced as follows: i The purpose and object of the 3rd proviso to Section 497 1 CrPC is to ensure that the trial of an accused is conducted and concluded expeditiously, and that the pre-conviction detention of an accused does not extend beyond the period of two years in cases involving an offence punishable with death, or one year in other cases; ii The period of one year or two years, as the case may be, for the conclusion of the trial begins from the date of the detention of the accused in the case, not from the date when the charge is framed and trial commenced; iii A statutory right to be released on bail accrues in favour of the accused if his trial is not concluded within the specified period, i.e., exceeding one year or two years as the case may be, from the date of his detention; iv This statutory right of the accused to be released on bail is, however, subject to two exceptions: one is embodied in the 3rd proviso itself and the second is provided in the 4th proviso, which are: a the delay in conclusion of the trial is occasioned by an act or omission of the accused or by any other person acting on his behalf, and b the accused is a convicted offender for an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life, or is in the opinion of the court a hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal, or is accused of an act of terrorism punishable with death or imprisonment for life.",

In this order, the first\ncategory shall be referred to as “Promotee Tehsildars” and the second\nas “Inducted Tehsildars.”\n\n2. The Punjab Provincial Management Service Rules, 2004 (“the\n2004 Rules”) have been made by the Governor of the Province of\nPunjab in exercise of the powers conferred under Section 23 of the\n\nPunjab Civil Servants Act, 1974. In exercise of the very same powers,\n\nCPLA No.55 OF 2025 -2:-\n\nthe Governor amended the 2004 Rules by substituting clause 2(a) in\ncolumn 7 against the post of “PMS (BS-17)” in Schedule-I with the\nfollowing:-\n\n“(a) 22.5% on the basis of seniority-cum-fitness from amongst\nTehsildars, who are graduates, and have five years’ service as\nTehsildar. However, in case of promotee Tehsildar, the condition of\n\nfive years’ service shall not be applicable; and”.\n(Emphasis added)\n\n3. The said amendment was set out in notification No.SOR-\nIII(S&GAD)1-16/2006, dated 21.08.2019 issued by Services and\nGeneral Administration Department (Regulation Wing), Government\nof the Punjab.\n\n4. Prior to the issuance of the notification dated 21.08.2019, the\nmethod of recruitment for Provincial Management Service Officers\n(BS-17) (“PMS Officers”) provided in clause 2(a), column 7 in\nSchedule-I of 2004 Rules was “22.5% on the basis of seniority-cum-\nfitness from amongst Tehsildars, who are graduates, and have five\nyears of service as Tehsildar.”\n\n2: It was not until 2024 that a process was initiated for the\npromotion of Tehsildars as PMS Officers. In this regard, the Board of\nRevenue, Punjab Establishment (Field Branch) vide letter dated\n24.04.2024 made a request for special arrangements to be made for\npre-promotion training for Tehsildars, which was mandatory for their\npromotion as PMS Officers. Letter dated 04.09.2024 from the\nServices and General Administration Department, Government of the\nPunjab (“S&GAD”) shows that a meeting of the Departmental\nPromotion Committee (“DPC”) was to be scheduled to consider the\npromotion cases of Tehsildars (BS-16) as PMS Officers (BS-17)\nagainst vacant posts. A request was made to the Secretary, Board of\nRevenue to furnish a working paper of eligible Tehsildars along with\n\nrelevant documentation.\n\nCPLA No.55 OF 2025 “3 :-\n\n6. It is crucial to bear in mind that most of the Inducted\nTehsildars were appointed in the year 2022 i.e., more than two years\nafter the issuance of the said notification dated 21.08.2019. The\ninitiation of the said process for promotion gave a cause of concern\nto those Inducted Tehsildars as they admittedly did not have five\nyears of service as Tehsildars to be eligible for consideration for\npromotion as PMS Officers. What posed as an obstacle to their\nconsideration for promotion was the amendment made in the 2004\nRules through the said notification dated 21.08.2019. The five years\nof service as Tehsildars was not required for the Promotee Tehsildars\nto be considered for promotion as PMS Officers. Some of the\nPromotee Tehsildars being considered for promotion were junior to\nthe Inducted Tehsildars in that they were promoted after the\ninduction of the Inducted Tehsildars. Consequently, the Inducted\nTehsildars submitted representations to Government of the Punjab\nrequesting for the notification dated 21.08.2019 to be revised / set-\naside.\n\n7. Apparently, writ petition No.18126/2024 was filed by the\nInducted Tehsildars before the Lahore High Court challenging the\nvires of notification dated 21.08.2019, whereas writ petition\nNo.14236/2024 was filed by the Promotee Tehsildars seeking for the\npromotion process to be taken to its logical conclusion. We say\n“apparently” because copies of these writ petitions are not on the\nrecord. Be that as it may, both these writ petitions were disposed of\nby the Lahore High Court with the direction to the Senior Member,\nBoard of Revenue, Punjab (““SMBR”) to afford an opportunity of a\nhearing to the parties and decide their grievances.\n\n8. On 18.11.2024, SMBR passed two orders - one with respect to\n\nthe order passed in writ petition No.14236/2024 filed by the\n\nCPLA No.55 OF 2025 = 45-\n\nPromotee Tehsildars and the other with respect to the order passed\nin writ petition No.18126/2024 filed by the Inducted Tehsildars.\n\n9. We shall first deal with the SMBR’s order dated 18.11.2024 as\nregards the grievances of the Promotee Tehsildars. Through the said\norder, the SMBR directed the Secretary, Board of Revenue, Punjab to\nensure the furnishing of a working paper for the promotion of\nTehsildars as PMS Officers to S&GAD “in accordance with existing\n\nPMS Rules, 2004.” The said order shows that there were more than\n\n110 posts of PMS Officers lying vacant against the 22.5% share /\nquota reserved under the 2004 Rules for the promotion of\nTehsildars. The said order also shows that two batches of Tehsildars\n(60 in numbers) had completed the mandatory training for\npromotion as PMS Officers and as such they were eligible for\nconsideration for promotion. The officer that had afforded an\nopportunity of a hearing to the parties had made the following\nrecommendations:-\n\n“In view of above, it is submitted that stance of B-Class Tehsildars\ncarries weight as having served for more than 12 years they were\npromoted from Naib Tehsildar to Tehsildar and now despite having\nmore than 110 vacant posts of PMC officers non furnishing of working\npaper to S&GAD may compromise their future promotion prospects.\nMoreover, there is no legal hitch in forwarding their working paper to\nS&GAD in accordance with prevailing PMS Rules. As far as the matter\npertains to request of A-Class Tehsildars regarding waiving off the\ncondition of five years service as Tehsildar on promotee Tehsildar is\nconcerned, it can be processed simultaneously.\n\nForegoing in view, in compliance with the direction made by the\nHon'ble Court it is recommended that working paper of Tehsildars for\npromotion against more than 110 vacant PMS posts against Tehsildari\nshare may be allowed to be forwarded to S&GAD in accordance with\nprevailing PMS Rules, 2004 and matter pertaining to the request of A-\nClass Tehsildar regarding waiving off the condition of five years as\nTehsildar on promotee Tehsildar may also be _ processed\nsimultaneously which will come into force after approval of due\namendment in PMS Rules, 2004 with immediate effect accordingly.”\n\n10. As regards SMBR’s second order dated 18.11.2024 dealing\nwith the grievances of the Inducted Tehsildars, a direction was\nissued to the Secretary, Revenue, Government of the Punjab to move\n\na reference to the Additional Secretary (Administration), S&GAD so\n\nCPLA No.55 OF 2025 =5:-\n\nthat the amendment made in the 2004 Rules through notification\ndated 21.08.2019 (pertaining to the waiving off of the condition of\nfive years of service for the promotion of Promotee Tehsildars as PMS\nOfficers) is reconsidered. In the said order, it was observed by the\nSMBR that the amendment made in the 2004 Rules made through\nnotification dated 21.08.2019 was “contrary to fundamental notion of\nequality and fair-play, against the principles of natural justice and is\ntantamount to infringing upon the rights of directly inducted tehsildars\nwho deserve equal treatment without any discrimination.”\n\n11. On 18.12.2024, the Board of Revenue, Punjab Establishment\n(Field Branch) called upon 37 Promotee Tehsildars to submit the\nrequisite documentation for their consideration for promotion as\nPMS Officers. Letter dated 24.12.2024 from S&GAD, Government of\nthe Punjab shows that the meeting of the DPC to consider the\npromotion cases of Tehsildars, etc. as PMS Officers (BS-17)\nscheduled to be held on 24.12.2024 was postponed.\n\n12. Two Inducted Tehsildars, namely Manzoor-ul-Haq /\nrespondent No,1 and Muhammad Abdul Rehman / respondent No.2\nfiled appeal No.3450/2024 before the Punjab Service Tribunal\nchallenging (i) letter dated 04.09.2024 from the S&GAD, Government\nof the Punjab showing that a meeting of the DPC was to be\nscheduled to consider the promotion cases of Tehsildars (BS-16) as\nPMS Officers (BS-17) against vacant posts, and (ii) letter dated\n18.12.2024, whereby 37 Promotee Tehsildars were required to\nsubmit their credentials for being considered in the process of their\npromotion as PMS Officers (BS-17). Furthermore, the appellants in\nthe said appeal sought a direction for their inclusion in the seniority\nlist of Tehsildar and for necessary amendments to be made in the\n\n2004 Rules on the basis of SMBR’s order dated 18.11.2024.\n\nCPLA No.55 OF 2025 - 6 i-\n\n13. Vide impugned order dated 23.12.2024, the Punjab Service\nTribunal disposed of appeal No.3450/2024 in the following terms:-\n\n“6. In view of the above, the instant appeal is disposed of with\nthe direction that the respondents to decide the departmental\nappeal/representation in view of letter/order dated 21.08.2019 and\n18.11.2024 and prepare a fresh seniority list in accordance with the\nPunjab Civil Servants (Appointment and Conditions of Service) Rules,\n1974 subject to outcome of decision of the departmental\nappeal/ representation.\n\nTill then, the promotion process of the respondents shall remain\nsuspended.”\n\nThe said order dated 23.12.2024 has been assailed by the\nPromotee Tehsildars in the instant petition.\n14. Learned counsel for the petitioners / Promotee Tehsildars\nsubmitted that the petitioners had served as Naib Tehsildars for\nseveral years before they were promoted as Tehsildars; that the\npetitioners are amongst the Tehsildars who are going to be\nconsidered for promotion as PMS Officers in the DPC which had\nbeen scheduled to be held on 24.12.2024; that the Inducted\nTehsildars have challenged the amendment made in the 2004 Rules,\nthrough notification dated 21.08.2019, in writ petition\nNo.61255/2024 which is still pending before the Lahore High Court;\nthat since the notification dated 21.08.2019 has not been declared\nunconstitutional, the same is to have its normal operation; and that\nan appeal before the service tribunal was filed by the Inducted\nTehsildars only after they were not able to obtain an injunctive order\nfrom the high court against the process of promotion.\n15. On the other hand, learned counsel for the contesting\nrespondents / Inducted Tehsildars submitted that 65 persons were\nselected as A-Class Tehsildars (BS-16) by the Punjab Public Service\nCommission after a rigorous and merit based selection process; that\nthe amendment in the 2004 Rules through notification dated\n\n21.08.2019 was causing sheer injustice to the Inducted Tehsildars;\n\nCPLA No.55 OF 2025 -: 7:\n\nthat through the said notification the condition of five years of\nmandatory service as Tehsildar for promotion as PMS Officers was\nremoved only for the Promotee Tehsildars; that since the Inducted\nTehsildars are mandatorily required to complete five years of service\nto be eligible for promotion as PMS Officers, discriminatory\ntreatment is being meted out to them; that the said notification\ndated 21.08.2019 has resulted in undue leverage to the Promotee\nTehsildars as many of them junior to the Inducted Tehsildars will\nbecome eligible for promotion before their senior Inducted\nTehsildars; that the said notification dated 21.08.2019 operates\ncontrary to the norms of equality and fair play; that the said\nnotification dated 21.08.2019 was issued at a time when direct\nrecruitment as Tehsildars had been halted since 2004; and that\nthere were hardly any Inducted Tehsildars to oppose the amendment\nmade in the 2004 Rules through the said notification dated\n21.08.2019. Learned counsel for the Inducted Tehsildars prayed for\nthe instant petition to be dismissed.\n\n16. We have heard the contentions of the learned counsel for the\ncontesting parties and have perused the record with their able\nassistance.\n\n17. Section 23(i) of the Punjab Civil Servants Act, 1974 provides\nthat the Governor, or any person authorized in this behalf may make\nsuch rules as appear to him to be necessary or expedient for\ncarrying out the purposes of the said Act. The 2004 Rules have been\nmade by the Governor in exercise of the powers conferred on him\nunder Section 23, and so has the amendment in Schedule-I to the\nsaid Rules through notification dated 21.08.2019. These Rules have\n\nthe same force as the provisions of the statute under which they are\n\nCPLA No.55 OF 2025 =4 Ght=\n\nframed. In the case of Anmad Hassaan Vs. Government of Punjab\n(2005 SCMR 186), this court held as follows:-\n\n“27. It is well-settled that Rules made under a statute must be treated\nfor all purposes of construction or application exactly as if they were\nin the Act and are to be of the same effect as if contained in the Act\nand are to be judicially noticed for all purposes of construction and\napplication. Such Rules cannot be treated as administrative\ndirections. Harilal v. Dy. Director of Consolidation, 1982 All. LJ\n223. They continue to be rules subordinate to the Act, and though for\ncertain purposes, including the purpose of construction, they are to be\ntreated as if contained in the Act, their true nature as subordinate rule\nis not lost. Chief Inspector of Mines v. K.C. Thapar, AIR 1961 SC 838,\n8457.7\n\n18. The amendments made in Schedule-I to the 2004 Rules\nthrough the said notification dated 21.08.2019 issued by S&GAD,\nGovernment of the Punjab, whereby the condition of five years of\nservice as Tehsildar for the Promotee Tehsildars for their\nconsideration for promotion as PMS Officers was done away with,\nare still in the field. Till date the notification dated 21.08.2019, has\nnot been declared ultra vires the provisions of the Punjab Civil\nServants Act, 1974 or the Constitution either by any court or\ntribunal.\n\n19. Respondents No.1 and 2 in their appeal before the Punjab\nService Tribunal also did not call in question the vires of the\nnotification dated 21.08.2019. Therefore, we in exercise of appellate\njurisdiction under Article 212(3) of the Constitution will not embark\non the exercise of examining the vires of the said notification.\n\n20. The views that the SMBR may have expressed in his order\ndated 18.11.2024 qua the said notification or the directions that he\nmay have issued to the Secretary, Revenue, Government of the\nPunjab would not have the effect of the annulment of the said\nnotification dated 21.08.2019. The said notification is based on an\n\namendment made in Schedule-I to the 2004 Rules by the Governor\n\nCPLA No.55 OF 2025 “ce\n\nin exercise of statutory power and it is he alone who can in the\nexercise of the very same power undo the amendment.\n\n21. Now, it remains to be seen whether the Governor in exercise of\nthe powers under Section 23 of the Punjab Civil Servants Act, 1974\nfurther amends Schedule-I to the 2004 Rules so as to reverse the\neffect of the notification dated 21.08.2019. Even though the\nGovernment of the Punjab has not challenged the order dated\n23.12.2024, Mr. Khalid Masood Ghani, Assistant Advocate General\nrepresenting the Government of the Punjab, could not state with\ncertainty as to whether the process has been initiated for the\nGovernor to make such an amendment. In the present scenario, we\nare of the view that the Promotee Tehsildars’ consideration of\npromotion as PMS Officers cannot be indefinitely placed in abeyance.\nIt is well settled that vacant posts must be filled in accordance with\nthe prescribed method of appointment at the earliest. In the case of\nGovernment of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Vs. Hizbullah Khan (2021\nSCMR 1281), the respondent’s case for promotion as Superintendent\n(BS-17) had been kept pending on the ground that new service rules\nwere in the process of being made. Since the existing rules were very\nmuch in force when the respondent’s case was put up before the\nDPC, this court took the view that the department’s justification for\nkeeping the respondent’s case pending till the finalization of new\nservice rules was ex facie illegal and also unjustified. Recently, this\ncourt in the judgment dated 21.04.2025 (not reported as yet) passed\nin CPLA No.3116/2022, titled “Aatika Hina Mushtaq Vs. Secretary,\nSpecial Education, Government of the Punjab” held that the decision\nof a DPC to withhold promotions till such time that the rules are\nsuitably amended was not sustainable. In this regard, paragraph 4\n\nof the said judgment is reproduced herein below:-\n\nCPLA No.55 OF 2025 -: 10:-\n\n“4, ...The DPC does not possess the mandate or the authority to\nquestion the Rules or refuse their enforcement. The Rules, including\nthe Note, provide a clear mechanism for determining seniority from the\ndate of acquiring the requisite qualification which had to be given\neffect by the DPC. The decision of the DPC that the Rules governing\nthe posts of PTI, PET, and DPE needed to be amended first before\nconsidering promotions, leading to the deferment of the petitioner’s\ncase, is without any lawful authority. Parties aggrieved of the\nNote/Rules can challenge the Rules, if they are so advised, but\nthe DPC cannot sit in judgment over the legality and\nenforceability of the Rules, which are duly framed under the\nlaw. The DPC is to examine the candidature of the officers under the\nlaw and process their cases for promotion, it lacks the authority to\nquestion the legality of the law or the Rules, which it is bound to\nenforce. Therefore, any proposed future amendments of the\nRules proposed by a Deputy Secretary/Representative of\nRegulations Wing, S&GAD, cannot bind the DPC to lay their\nhands off and defer promotions on this pretext. The DPC is\nbound to follow the law as it exists. It is axiomatic that the\npromotion of a civil servant cannot be withheld merely because\namendments to the Rules are being contemplated.\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\n22. The process of the promotion, in our view, cannot be halted at\nthe instance of the Inducted Tehsildars for the simple reason that\nwhen the Inducted Tehsildars were directly appointed in the year\n2022, the notification dated 21.08.2019 had already been issued.\nThe Inducted Tehsildars were aware or expected to be aware of their\nterms and conditions of service to be governed by the 2004 Rules of\nwhich the amendment made in Schedule-I to the 2004 Rules\nthrough notification dated 21.08.2019 was an integral part. They\njoined service knowing fully well the adverse effect of the notification\ndated 21.08.2019 on their promotion prospects. Therefore, unless\nand until and if at all the amendments brought about in Schedule-I\nto the 2004 Rules through the notification dated 21.08.2019 are\ndeclared ultra vires by a competent court / tribunal or the said\nnotification is withdrawn on the basis of the Governor reversing the\namendment made in the method of promotion of Tehsildars as PMS\nOfficers contained in Schedule-I to the 2004 Rules, the process of\n\npromotion cannot be halted.\n\nCPLA No.55 OF 2025 --11:-\n\n23. We are dismayed to note that presently there are 110 vacant\nposts of PMS Officers which are to be filled by promotion of\nTehsildars. Public sector employment in Pakistan is a significant\nsource of financial stability for many households. Prolonged\nvacancies not only limit their employment opportunities but also\ndiminish public confidence in government institutions.\n\n24. “Post” denotes the number of posts in the cadre, whether filled\nor vacant. “Vacancy” means a vacant post available for appointment,\nthrough recruitment / promotion, on the creation of new post(s) or\nretirement, death or resignation or removal of the incumbent\nworking on the post. In public administration, every post in the\norganizational hierarchy is created after due deliberation and\napproval, taking into account the functional requirements of the\ndepartment, the workload, and the efficient delivery of services to the\npublic. This process ensures that each sanctioned post is essential\nfor the functioning of public institutions. In other words, each\nsanctioned post reflects a deliberate recognition of a need — whether\ntechnical, supervisory, operational, or strategic - within the\nframework of good governance. Importantly, financial allocations are\nalso secured through budgetary processes to ensure that post is\nfunded and resourced. The practice of routinely leaving posts in\npublic institutions unfilled undermines the very rationale of\nsanctioned strength. If a post is not needed, it should be abolished\nthrough proper procedure; but if it has been duly approved and\nbudgeted, it must be filled without undue delay.\n\n25. It is not advisable to keep a post vacant as it hampers the\nfunctioning of public institutions and is not conducive to the\nmaintenance of efficiency of administration. The objective of timely\n\npromotions of eligible employees in various public institutions can be\n\nCPLA No.55 OF 2025 --12:-\n\nachieved only by convening of meetings of DPCs. The timely filling of\nvacant posts is not only an administrative imperative but is essential\nfor maintaining the integrity, efficiency, and responsiveness of public\ninstitutions.\n\n26. In view of the above, leave to appeal is granted; the instant\npetition is converted into appeal and allowed in terms that the\nprocess for the promotion of Tehsildars as PMS Officers already\ninitiated may continue unless amendment made in the 2004 Rules\nthrough notification dated 21.08.2019 is withdrawn by the Governor\nin exercise of the powers conferred by Section 23 of the Punjab Civil\nServants Act, 1974 or the Governor further amends clause 2(a) in\ncolumn No.7 with respect to the post of PMS Officers (BS-17) in\n\nSchedule-I to the 2004 Rules.\n\nAnnounced in open Court on 30 .06.2025 at Islamabad\n\nt_ approved for reportin\nhtesham Majid",
            "CleanedText": "JUDGMENT MIANGUL HASSAN AURANGZEB, J.- The subject matter of the instant petition is a dispute between two categories of Tehsildars. The petitioners fall in the category of Tehsildars who were promoted from the position of Naib Tehsildar, whereas the contesting respondents were directly inducted as Tehsildars through the Punjab Public Service Commission in the year 2022. In this order, the first category shall be referred to as Promotee Tehsildars and the second as Inducted Tehsildars. 2. The Punjab Provincial Management Service Rules, 2004 the 2004 Rules have been made by the Governor of the Province of Punjab in exercise of the powers conferred under Section 23 of the Punjab Civil Servants Act, 1974. In exercise of the very same powers, CPLA No.55 OF 2025 -2:- the Governor amended the 2004 Rules by substituting clause 2 a in column 7 against the post of PMS BS-17 in Schedule-I with the following:- a 22.5 on the basis of seniority-cum-fitness from amongst Tehsildars, who are graduates, and have five years service as Tehsildar. However, in case of promotee Tehsildar, the condition of five years service shall not be applicable; and . Emphasis added 3. The said amendment was set out in notification No.SORIII S GAD 1-16/2006, dated 21.08.2019 issued by Services and General Administration Department Regulation Wing , Government of the Punjab. 4. Prior to the issuance of the notification dated 21.08.2019, the method of recruitment for Provincial Management Service Officers BS-17 PMS Officers provided in clause 2 a , column 7 in Schedule-I of 2004 Rules was 22.5 on the basis of seniority-cumfitness from amongst Tehsildars, who are graduates, and have five years of service as Tehsildar. 2: It was not until 2024 that a process was initiated for the promotion of Tehsildars as PMS Officers. In this regard, the Board of Revenue, Punjab Establishment Field Branch vide letter dated 24.04.2024 made a request for special arrangements to be made for pre-promotion training for Tehsildars, which was mandatory for their promotion as PMS Officers.

A request was made to the Secretary, Board of Revenue to furnish a working paper of eligible Tehsildars along with relevant documentation. CPLA No.55 OF 2025 3 :- 6. It is crucial to bear in mind that most of the Inducted Tehsildars were appointed in the year 2022 i.e., more than two years after the issuance of the said notification dated 21.08.2019. The initiation of the said process for promotion gave a cause of concern to those Inducted Tehsildars as they admittedly did not have five years of service as Tehsildars to be eligible for consideration for promotion as PMS Officers. What posed as an obstacle to their consideration for promotion was the amendment made in the 2004 Rules through the said notification dated 21.08.2019. The five years of service as Tehsildars was not required for the Promotee Tehsildars to be considered for promotion as PMS Officers. Some of the Promotee Tehsildars being considered for promotion were junior to the Inducted Tehsildars in that they were promoted after the induction of the Inducted Tehsildars. Consequently, the Inducted Tehsildars submitted representations to Government of the Punjab requesting for the notification dated 21.08.2019 to be revised / setaside. 7. Apparently, writ petition No.18126/2024 was filed by the Inducted Tehsildars before the Lahore High Court challenging the vires of notification dated 21.08.2019, whereas writ petition No.14236/2024 was filed by the Promotee Tehsildars seeking for the promotion process to be taken to its logical conclusion. We say apparently because copies of these writ petitions are not on the record. Be that as it may, both these writ petitions were disposed of by the Lahore High Court with the direction to the Senior Member, Board of Revenue, Punjab SMBR to afford an opportunity of a hearing to the parties and decide their grievances. 8. On 18.11.2024, SMBR passed two orders - one with respect to the order passed in writ petition No.14236/2024 filed by the CPLA No.55 OF 2025 45Promotee Tehsildars and the other with respect to the order passed in writ petition No.18126/2024 filed by the Inducted Tehsildars. 9. We shall first deal with the SMBR s order dated 18.11.2024 as regards the grievances of the Promotee Tehsildars. Through the said order, the SMBR directed the Secretary, Board of Revenue, Punjab to ensure the furnishing of a working paper for the promotion of Tehsildars as PMS Officers to S GAD in accordance with existing PMS Rules, 2004. The said order shows that there were more than 110 posts of PMS Officers lying vacant against the 22.5 share / quota reserved under the 2004 Rules for the promotion of Tehsildars. The said order also shows that two batches of Tehsildars 60 in numbers had completed the mandatory training for promotion as PMS Officers and as such they were eligible for consideration for promotion. The officer that had afforded an opportunity of a hearing to the parties had made the following recommendations:- In view of above, it is submitted that stance of B-Class Tehsildars carries weight as having served for more than 12 years they were promoted from Naib Tehsildar to Tehsildar and now despite having more than 110 vacant posts of PMC officers non furnishing of working paper to S GAD may compromise their future promotion prospects. Moreover, there is no legal hitch in forwarding their working paper to S GAD in accordance with prevailing PMS Rules. As far as the matter pertains to request of A-Class Tehsildars regarding waiving off the condition of five years service as Tehsildar on promotee Tehsildar is concerned, it can be processed simultaneously. Foregoing in view, in compliance with the direction made by the Hon ble Court it is recommended that working paper of Tehsildars for promotion against more than 110 vacant PMS posts against Tehsildari share may be allowed to be forwarded to S GAD in accordance with prevailing PMS Rules, 2004 and matter pertaining to the request of AClass Tehsildar regarding waiving off the condition of five years as Tehsildar on promotee Tehsildar may also be processed simultaneously which will come into force after approval of due amendment in PMS Rules, 2004 with immediate effect accordingly. 10. As regards SMBR s second order dated 18.11.2024 dealing with the grievances of the Inducted Tehsildars, a direction was issued to the Secretary, Revenue, Government of the Punjab to move a reference to the Additional Secretary Administration , S GAD so CPLA No.55 OF 2025 5:- that the amendment made in the 2004 Rules through notification dated 21.08.2019 pertaining to the waiving off of the condition of five years of service for the promotion of Promotee Tehsildars as PMS Officers is reconsidered. In the said order, it was observed by the SMBR that the amendment made in the 2004 Rules made through notification dated 21.08.2019 was contrary to fundamental notion of equality and fair-play, against the principles of natural justice and is tantamount to infringing upon the rights of directly inducted tehsildars who deserve equal treatment without any discrimination. 11. On 18.12.2024, the Board of Revenue, Punjab Establishment Field Branch called upon 37 Promotee Tehsildars to submit the requisite documentation for their consideration for promotion as PMS Officers. Letter dated 24.12.2024 from S GAD, Government of the Punjab shows that the meeting of the DPC to consider the promotion cases of Tehsildars, etc. as PMS Officers BS-17 scheduled to be held on 24.12.2024 was postponed. 12. Two Inducted Tehsildars, namely Manzoor-ul-Haq / respondent No,1 and Muhammad Abdul Rehman / respondent No.2 filed appeal No.3450/2024 before the Punjab Service Tribunal challenging i letter dated 04.09.2024 from the S GAD, Government of the Punjab showing that a meeting of the DPC was to be scheduled to consider the promotion cases of Tehsildars BS-16 as PMS Officers BS-17 against vacant posts, and ii letter dated 18.12.2024, whereby 37 Promotee Tehsildars were required to submit their credentials for being considered in the process of their promotion as PMS Officers BS-17 . Furthermore, the appellants in the said appeal sought a direction for their inclusion in the seniority list of Tehsildar and for necessary amendments to be made in the 2004 Rules on the basis of SMBR s order dated 18.11.2024. CPLA No.55 OF 2025 - 6 i13. Vide impugned order dated 23.12.2024, the Punjab Service Tribunal disposed of appeal No.3450/2024 in the following terms:- 6. In view of the above, the instant appeal is disposed of with the direction that the respondents to decide the departmental appeal/representation in view of letter/order dated 21.08.2019 and 18.11.2024 and prepare a fresh seniority list in accordance with the Punjab Civil Servants Appointment and Conditions of Service Rules, 1974 subject to outcome of decision of the departmental appeal/ representation. Till then, the promotion process of the respondents shall remain suspended. The said order dated 23.12.2024 has been assailed by the Promotee Tehsildars in the instant petition. 14. Learned counsel for the petitioners / Promotee Tehsildars submitted that the petitioners had served as Naib Tehsildars for several years before they were promoted as Tehsildars; that the petitioners are amongst the Tehsildars who are going to be considered for promotion as PMS Officers in the DPC which had been scheduled to be held on 24.12.2024; that the Inducted Tehsildars have challenged the amendment made in the 2004 Rules, through notification dated 21.08.2019, in writ petition No.61255/2024 which is still pending before the Lahore High Court; that since the notification dated 21.08.2019 has not been declared unconstitutional, the same is to have its normal operation; and that an appeal before the service tribunal was filed by the Inducted Tehsildars only after they were not able to obtain an injunctive order from the high court against the process of promotion. 15. On the other hand, learned counsel for the contesting respondents / Inducted Tehsildars submitted that 65 persons were selected as A-Class Tehsildars BS-16 by the Punjab Public Service Commission after a rigorous and merit based selection process; that the amendment in the 2004 Rules through notification dated 21.08.2019 was causing sheer injustice to the Inducted Tehsildars; CPLA No.55 OF 2025 -: 7: that through the said notification the condition of five years of mandatory service as Tehsildar for promotion as PMS Officers was removed only for the Promotee Tehsildars; that since the Inducted Tehsildars are mandatorily required to complete five years of service to be eligible for promotion as PMS Officers, discriminatory treatment is being meted out to them; that the said notification dated 21.08.2019 has resulted in undue leverage to the Promotee Tehsildars as many of them junior to the Inducted Tehsildars will become eligible for promotion before their senior Inducted Tehsildars; that the said notification dated 21.08.2019 operates contrary to the norms of equality and fair play; that the said notification dated 21.08.2019 was issued at a time when direct recruitment as Tehsildars had been halted since 2004; and that there were hardly any Inducted Tehsildars to oppose the amendment made in the 2004 Rules through the said notification dated 21.08.2019. Learned counsel for the Inducted Tehsildars prayed for the instant petition to be dismissed. 16. We have heard the contentions of the learned counsel for the contesting parties and have perused the record with their able assistance. 17. Section 23 i of the Punjab Civil Servants Act, 1974 provides that the Governor, or any person authorized in this behalf may make such rules as appear to him to be necessary or expedient for carrying out the purposes of the said Act. The 2004 Rules have been made by the Governor in exercise of the powers conferred on him under Section 23, and so has the amendment in Schedule-I to the said Rules through notification dated 21.08.2019. These Rules have the same force as the provisions of the statute under which they are CPLA No.55 OF 2025 4 Ght framed. In the case of Anmad Hassaan Vs. Government of Punjab 2005 SCMR 186 , this court held as follows:- 27. It is well-settled that Rules made under a statute must be treated for all purposes of construction or application exactly as if they were in the Act and are to be of the same effect as if contained in the Act and are to be judicially noticed for all purposes of construction and application. Such Rules cannot be treated as administrative directions. Harilal v. Dy. Director of Consolidation, 1982 All. LJ 223. They continue to be rules subordinate to the Act, and though for certain purposes, including the purpose of construction, they are to be treated as if contained in the Act, their true nature as subordinate rule is not lost. Chief Inspector of Mines v. K.C. Thapar, AIR 1961 SC 838, 8457.7 18. The amendments made in Schedule-I to the 2004 Rules through the said notification dated 21.08.2019 issued by S GAD, Government of the Punjab, whereby the condition of five years of service as Tehsildar for the Promotee Tehsildars for their consideration for promotion as PMS Officers was done away with, are still in the field. Till date the notification dated 21.08.2019, has not been declared ultra vires the provisions of the Punjab Civil Servants Act, 1974 or the Constitution either by any court or tribunal. 19. Respondents No.1 and 2 in their appeal before the Punjab Service Tribunal also did not call in question the vires of the notification dated 21.08.2019. Therefore, we in exercise of appellate jurisdiction under Article 212 3 of the Constitution will not embark on the exercise of examining the vires of the said notification. 20. The views that the SMBR may have expressed in his order dated 18.11.2024 qua the said notification or the directions that he may have issued to the Secretary, Revenue, Government of the Punjab would not have the effect of the annulment of the said notification dated 21.08.2019. The said notification is based on an amendment made in Schedule-I to the 2004 Rules by the Governor CPLA No.55 OF 2025 ce in exercise of statutory power and it is he alone who can in the exercise of the very same power undo the amendment. 21. Now, it remains to be seen whether the Governor in exercise of the powers under Section 23 of the Punjab Civil Servants Act, 1974 further amends Schedule-I to the 2004 Rules so as to reverse the effect of the notification dated 21.08.2019. Even though the Government of the Punjab has not challenged the order dated 23.12.2024, Mr. Khalid Masood Ghani, Assistant Advocate General representing the Government of the Punjab, could not state with certainty as to whether the process has been initiated for the Governor to make such an amendment. In the present scenario, we are of the view that the Promotee Tehsildars consideration of promotion as PMS Officers cannot be indefinitely placed in abeyance. It is well settled that vacant posts must be filled in accordance with the prescribed method of appointment at the earliest. In the case of Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Vs. Hizbullah Khan 2021 SCMR 1281 , the respondent s case for promotion as Superintendent BS-17 had been kept pending on the ground that new service rules were in the process of being made. Since the existing rules were very much in force when the respondent s case was put up before the DPC, this court took the view that the department s justification for keeping the respondent s case pending till the finalization of new service rules was ex facie illegal and also unjustified. Recently, this court in the judgment dated 21.04.2025 not reported as yet passed in CPLA No.3116/2022, titled Aatika Hina Mushtaq Vs. Secretary, Special Education, Government of the Punjab held that the decision of a DPC to withhold promotions till such time that the rules are suitably amended was not sustainable. In this regard, paragraph 4 of the said judgment is reproduced herein below:- CPLA No.55 OF 2025 -: 10:- 4, ...The DPC does not possess the mandate or the authority to question the Rules or refuse their enforcement. The Rules, including the Note, provide a clear mechanism for determining seniority from the date of acquiring the requisite qualification which had to be given effect by the DPC. The decision of the DPC that the Rules governing the posts of PTI, PET, and DPE needed to be amended first before considering promotions, leading to the deferment of the petitioner s case, is without any lawful authority. Parties aggrieved of the Note/Rules can challenge the Rules, if they are so advised, but the DPC cannot sit in judgment over the legality and enforceability of the Rules, which are duly framed under the law. The DPC is to examine the candidature of the officers under the law and process their cases for promotion, it lacks the authority to question the legality of the law or the Rules, which it is bound to enforce. Therefore, any proposed future amendments of the Rules proposed by a Deputy Secretary/Representative of Regulations Wing, S GAD, cannot bind the DPC to lay their hands off and defer promotions on this pretext. The DPC is bound to follow the law as it exists. It is axiomatic that the promotion of a civil servant cannot be withheld merely because amendments to the Rules are being contemplated. Emphasis added 22. The process of the promotion, in our view, cannot be halted at the instance of the Inducted Tehsildars for the simple reason that when the Inducted Tehsildars were directly appointed in the year 2022, the notification dated 21.08.2019 had already been issued. The Inducted Tehsildars were aware or expected to be aware of their terms and conditions of service to be governed by the 2004 Rules of which the amendment made in Schedule-I to the 2004 Rules through notification dated 21.08.2019 was an integral part. They joined service knowing fully well the adverse effect of the notification dated 21.08.2019 on their promotion prospects. Therefore, unless and until and if at all the amendments brought about in Schedule-I to the 2004 Rules through the notification dated 21.08.2019 are declared ultra vires by a competent court / tribunal or the said notification is withdrawn on the basis of the Governor reversing the amendment made in the method of promotion of Tehsildars as PMS Officers contained in Schedule-I to the 2004 Rules, the process of promotion cannot be halted. CPLA No.55 OF 2025 --11:- 23. We are dismayed to note that presently there are 110 vacant posts of PMS Officers which are to be filled by promotion of Tehsildars. Public sector employment in Pakistan is a significant source of financial stability for many households. Prolonged vacancies not only limit their employment opportunities but also diminish public confidence in government institutions. 24. Post denotes the number of posts in the cadre, whether filled or vacant. Vacancy means a vacant post available for appointment, through recruitment / promotion, on the creation of new post s or retirement, death or resignation or removal of the incumbent working on the post. In public administration, every post in the organizational hierarchy is created after due deliberation and approval, taking into account the functional requirements of the department, the workload, and the efficient delivery of services to the public. This process ensures that each sanctioned post is essential for the functioning of public institutions. In other words, each sanctioned post reflects a deliberate recognition of a need whether technical, supervisory, operational, or strategic - within the framework of good governance. Importantly, financial allocations are also secured through budgetary processes to ensure that post is funded and resourced. The practice of routinely leaving posts in public institutions unfilled undermines the very rationale of sanctioned strength. If a post is not needed, it should be abolished through proper procedure; but if it has been duly approved and budgeted, it must be filled without undue delay. 25. It is not advisable to keep a post vacant as it hampers the functioning of public institutions and is not conducive to the maintenance of efficiency of administration. The objective of timely promotions of eligible employees in various public institutions can be CPLA No.55 OF 2025 --12:- achieved only by convening of meetings of DPCs. The timely filling of vacant posts is not only an administrative imperative but is essential for maintaining the integrity, efficiency, and responsiveness of public institutions. 26. In view of the above, leave to appeal is granted; the instant petition is converted into appeal and allowed in terms that the process for the promotion of Tehsildars as PMS Officers already initiated may continue unless amendment made in the 2004 Rules through notification dated 21.08.2019 is withdrawn by the Governor in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 23 of the Punjab Civil Servants Act, 1974 or the Governor further amends clause 2 a in column No.7 with respect to the post of PMS Officers BS-17 in Schedule-I to the 2004 Rules.

We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioners\nand have also gone through the available record.\n\n2. The record of the case would reveal that Respondent\nNo.1 (now deceased, through her legal heirs) being daughter of\n\nSiraj Din had filed a suit for declaration claiming therein her\n\n\n20-Civil Petition No.1841 of 2025 -2-\n\nlegal/sharai share from the legacy of her father. The inheritance\nmutation of Siraj Din bearing No.1896 dated 17.06.1947 (Exh.P-5)\navailable on the file itself would show that attempts were made to\ngrab the property of Siraj Din even by Haji (his brother, father of\nDefendants No.2-9 and gnd husband of Defendant No.1 (now\ndeceased) and ultimately it was attested in the name of his widow\nMst. Bhagan Bibi (the deceased Defendant No.1). The Defendants\nNo.1-9 except Defendant No.4 (the defendants) contested the suit\nby filing their written statement whereas Defendant No.4, who filed\nhis separate written statement. The Defendants denied the stance\nof Respondent No.1 by alleging that Siraj Din (the father of\nRespondent No.1) died issueless and as such Respondent No.1 was\nnot his daughter and not entitled to inherit from the legacy of Siraj\nDin. The Defendant No.4 (who is the brother of the Defendants)\nthrough his written statement not only admitted that the\nRespondent No.1 was the daughter of Siraj Din, his real uncle, and\nhas also admitted that she was the step sister of the Defendants\nand daughter of Mst. Bhagan Bibi, the Defendant No.1 and this\nvery written statement fully supports the stance of Respondent\nNo.1 and thereby the Respondent No.4 depicted and portrayed the\nactual story of the true facts and for no apparent benefit through\nsuch conceding statement, despite the fact that he had the same\nlegal and sharai status as the other Defendants had. He also\nappeared as PW-3 and reiterated his stance by facing the test of\ncross-examination. Despite long and searching cross-examination\nhis stance was not shattered. The Defendants also failed to put\n\nforth any specific stance qua the status of Respondent No.1. Mere\n\n\n20-Civil Petition No.1841 of 2! -3-\n\ndenial of her status by them would not absolve them from their\nresponsibility and the stance of the Respondent No.1 cannot be\nfalsified by simple denial of the Defendants. In support of their\nspecific stance, there should have been a strong and worth reliance\nevidence. The evidence so led by them is not only oral one but also\nshort of such requirements and is not sufficient/enough to rebut\nthe documentary evidence led by the Respondent No.1.\n\n4. The legal and sharai status of the plaintiff (Respondent\nNo.1) and the Defendants (the Respondents No.2-9) is established\non the record and all the three Courts have concurrently accepted\nthe claim of Respondent No.1. It is important to mention here that\nthe Respondents No.2-9, who are the main contestants of the case,\nhave not challenged the decree of the trial Court in favour of\nRespondent No.1 by way of an appeal or civil revision. This alone\nfurther strengthens the case of Respondent No.1. After dismissal of\nappeal and then civil revision, the decree of the trial Court merged\ninto the decree of the High Court. It was the Defendant No.10 and\nthen his legal heirs, who have challenged the decree of the trial\nCourt by way of an appeal before the District Judge and then civil\nrevision before the High Court but were unable to get any relief.\nNow they are before this Court through the instant civil petition.\n\n5. The Defendant No.10 (the predecessor of the\npetitioners) vide Mutation No.3961 dated 09.07.2009 (Exh.P-6)\npurchased the share of Mst. Bhagan Bibi (the property inherited\nby her as widow of Siraj Din). This was the property of Mst.\nBhagan Bibi received by her from the inheritance of her deceased\n\nhusband namely, Siraj Din as limited owner. Her status as limited\n\n\n20-Civil Petition 41 of 202. -4-\n\nowner was terminated under Section 3 of the West Pakistan\nMuslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1962 (the Act of\n1962).\n\nAfter termination of her status as limited owner, the property\noccupied by her would be considered as the property of last male\nowner and in this case last male owner was her late husband Siraj\nDin and according to the Act of 1962, the property has to be\nreverted back to his legal heirs. The record would establish the fact\nthat the plaintiff as daughter, Defendant No.1 as widow and\nremaining to Haji as brother (as Siraj Din had no male issue) are\nentitled to inherit the legacy of Siraj Din and this very status of the\nparties as declared by the three Courts has attained finality. The\nsame has not been questioned by the actual parties i.e., the\nDefendants (Respondents No.2-9). The predecessor of the\npetitioners, the Defendant No. 10, legally stepped into the shoes of\nthe Defendant No.1 (now deceased) as he purchased the property\nfrom her vide Ex.P-6 and can ask only for the share of Mst.\nBhagan Bibi received by her after promulgation of the Act of 1962\nand the rest would go to the other legal heirs of Siraj Din as noted\nabove. So, the sale made by Mst. Bhagan Bibi, the Defendant No.1\nvide Exh.P-6 will only be effective to the extent of her own share as\ndiscussed above and that will be invalid, void and will be ineffective\nto the extent of rights of plaintiff (Respondent No.1) and Haji,\npredecessor of Respondents No.2-9. This would not be out of\ncontext to mention here that the plaintiff (Respondent No.1) cannot\nclaim legacy of her mother (in the property left by her father) as\n\nshe sold away her share in her lifetime to the predecessor of the\n\n\n20-Ciyil Petition No.1841 of 2025 -5-\n\npetitioners, the Defendant No.10. As far as the transfer of property\nby way of an exchange Mutation No.2787 dated 26.04.2004\n(Exh.P-8) in favour of Defendant No.11 (Respondent No. 10)\nMuhammad Ashiq (deceased) is concerned that was only to the\nextent of 15/1647 shares, an area of 3 Kanal and 0 Marla only, so\nthe remaining property if any, in the name of Mst. Bhagan Bibi as\nwidow of Haji (if not further transferred in her lifetime) would be\nheritable by the plaintiff (Respondent No.1) being her daughter to\nthe extent of her legal/ sharai share along with her other legal\nheirs, Respondents No.3-9. This can be clarified from the record\nand is necessary for substantial justice.\n\n6. Since the actual defendants (Respondents No.3-9)\nhave accepted the decrees in favour of plaintiff (Respondent No.1)\nand the status of Defendant No.10 (predecessor of the petitioners)\nis simply that of a purchaser who _ legally cannot\nchallenge/question the legal and sharai status of Respondent No.1\nor the other respondents. He, (the petitioners) for that matter, has\nno locus standi and cause of action to challenge the same. He, (the\npetitioners) at the most, can ask the Defendants No.2-9\n(Respondents No.3-9) as they are the legal heirs of Mst. Bhagan\nBibi for redressal of their grievance if any. This petition, his appeal\nbefore the District Court and civil revision before the High Court\nwere not maintainable even on this score alone.\n\nte The concurrent findings of facts recorded by three\nCourts cannot be questioned in absence of any misreading or non-\n\nreading of material evidence or any other material irregularity or\n\n\nCivil n_No.1841 of 20. -6-\n\nillegality.

The powers of the President of Pakistan under Sub-article (1)\nof Article 200 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of\nPakistan, 1973 (“Constitution”) for the transfer of a Judge of\nthe High Court from one High Court to another High Court and\nthe provisions contained under Article 175A of the Constitution\nfor appointment of Judges to the Supreme Court, High Courts,\nand the Federal Shariat Court by the Judicial Commission of\nPakistan (“JCP”) are two distinct provisions dealing with\ndifferent situations and niceties. Neither do they overlap nor\noverride each other. The transfer of a judge by the President of\nPakistan by means of Article 200 of the Constitution\n(permanently or temporarily) cannot be construed as a fresh\nappointment. Furthermore, the powers of transfer conferred to\nthe President by none other than the framers of the Constitution\n\nConst.Ps.No.22,20,25-28 & 30/2025 -3-\n\ncannot be questioned on the anvil or ground that if the posts\nwere vacant in the Islamabad High Court, then why they were\nnot filled up by JCP through fresh appointments. One more\nimportant facet that cannot be lost sight of is that the transfer\nfrom one High Court to another High Court can only be made\nwithin the sanctioned strength, which can only be regarded as a\nmere transfer and does not amount to raising the sanctioned\nstrength of a particular High Court.\n\n2. In all fairness, if it is presumed that all posts should be filled\nby the JCP alone through fresh appointments, then such\ninterpretation or state of mind, in our view, would not only go\nagainst the manifest intention of the framers of the Constitution\nbut will also amount to negating or making redundant the\nsubstratum and existence of Article 200 of the Constitution;\nwhich Article is absolutely not dependent, concomitant, or at the\nmercy of Article 175A of the Constitution, but is an independent\nand standalone provision dealing with the transfer of judges of a\nHigh Court (permanently or temporarily) and not the\nappointment of judges, which assignment has _ been\nincontrovertibly conferred to the JCP autonomously in terms of\nArticle 175A of the Constitution.\n\n3. As far as Section 3 of the Islamabad High Court Act, 2010, is\nconcerned, it only divulges that the Islamabad High Court shall\nconsist of a Chief Justice and twelve other judges to be appointed\nfrom the provinces and other territories of Pakistan in\naccordance with the Constitution. In our considered view, this\nprovision is only germane to the appointment of judges and does\nnot, in any way, mean that a judge can only join the Islamabad\nHigh Court through a fresh appointment and not by way of a\ntransfer or, in other words, that Article 200 does not apply to the\nIslamabad High Court, which interpretation would be against\nthe exactitudes of the Constitution. Neither can Section 3 of the\naforesaid Act supersede/override a constitutional mandate, nor\ncan it control, nullify, or rescind the powers of transfer that are\nvested in the President of Pakistan under Article 200 of the\nConstitution.\n\n4. Nevertheless, the exercise of the powers of transfer by the\nPresident of Pakistan under Article 200 of the Constitution is not\nunregulated or unfettered. It is structured on a four tier formula\nwhich expounds that no judge shall be transferred except with\nhis consent and after consultation by the President with the\nChief Justice of Pakistan and the Chief Justices of both High\nCourts. What does this mean? If at the very initial stage, a judge\nintended to be transferred from one High Court to another High\nCourt refuses the offer/ proposal, then obviously the matter ends\nforthwith. Even in the case of consent, the transfer shall be\nsubject to consultation with two Chief Justices of the High\nCourts and the Chief Justice of Pakistan, as the paterfamilias of\njudiciary, who may, during the consultation process,\npragmatically ruminate the pros and cons germane to the\ntransfer proposal, including the aspect of public interest, if any.\nHence, for all intents and purposes, it is reverberated beyond\nany shadow of doubt that before exercising the power of transfer,\ncertain inbuilt procedures and mechanisms have to be followed\nin letter and spirit and the decision, or the right of refusal or\nprimacy, is within the sphere and realm of judiciary and not\nwithin the domain of executives. Therefore, it does not in any\n\nConst.Ps.No.22,20,25-28 & 30/2025 -4-\n\ncase compromise the independence of the judiciary for the\ndiscernable reason that the decision to accept or reject is\nexclusively within the hands of the judiciary.\n\n5. Thus, for all intents and purposes, the transfer of judges by\nthe President of Pakistan, by means of the impugned Notification\nNo. F.10 (2)/2024-A.I], dated 1st February 2025 (“Notification”)\nis within the framework of the Constitution and cannot be\ndeclared ultra vires.\n\n6. We are sanguine that in normal circumstances, the decision\non inter_se seniority disputes or disagreements amongst the\njudges of a High Court are within the domain of the Chief Justice\nof that High Court, at the administrative side, but here the\nmatter relates to the transfer of judges from other High Courts\nto the Islamabad High Court. Thus, the seniority issue is not\nexactly inter se seniority within the existing strength of judges of\none and the same High Court, prior to bringing forth the transfer\nof three judges under Article 200 of the Constitution, but is\nsomewhat cropped up between the transferee judges and the\njudges that already existed prior to the transfer. At this juncture,\nit is also pertinent to mention that there is no All Pakistan\nCadre/unified or combined seniority list of High Court judges for\ndetermining their seniority at the time of transfer. Therefore, in\nour view, the terms and conditions of transfer (permanently or\ntemporary) including seniority should have been taken up and\nmentioned by the President of Pakistan at the time of issuing the\nNotification of transfer in terms of Article 200 of the\nConstitution.\n\n7. As a result of the above discussion, we partially remand the\nmatter to the President of Pakistan, without upsetting the\nNotification of transfer, to determine the seniority after\nexamining/vetting the service record of the transferee judges as\nsoon as possible, including the question of whether the transfer\nis on a permanent or temporary basis.\n\n8. Till such time that the seniority and nature of transfer\n(permanent or temporary) of the transferee judges is determined\nby the President of Pakistan by means of notification/order, Mr.\nJustice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar, already holding the\noffice of Acting Chief Justice of the Islamabad High Court, will\ncontinue to perform as the Acting Chief Justice of the Islamabad\nHigh Court.\n\n2.

Sabran Bibi having narcotics in her possession for the purpose of selling the\nsame to customers at the edge of LBDC canal Kachi Abadi falling within the\ncriminal jurisdiction of Police Station Ghalla Mandi Sahiwal, on 19.11.2022\nGhulam Abbas SI (PW.2) along with other police officials including a lady\nconstable Aqsa Saddique No.1620 (PW.1) reached the spot and at 08.00 A.M.\napprehended the petitioner having a blue colour polythene bag in her possession\nsearch of which led to the recovery of two pieces of chars, one weighing 1260\ngrams and another 1100 grams. The Seizing Officer separated 63 grams and 55\ngrams, respectively, from the recovered pieces as samples for chemical analysis by\n\nthe FSL and sealed the same in parcels. He also sealed the remained quantity of\n\nCrl. P.L.A. No. 379/ 2025 2\n\nchars in separate parcel and thereafter took the same into possession through\nrecovery memo Exh.PA in presence of its marginal witnesses. He drafted\ncomplaint Exh.PB on the basis of which FIR No. 1593/2022 dated 19.11.2022\nunder section 9(1)c Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 (“Act of 19097)\n\nwas registered against the petitioner.\n\n2. After facing regular trial, the learned Additional Sessions Judge Sahiwal\n(“Trial Court”) convicted the petitioner under section 9(1)c of the Act of 1997 and\nsentenced her to rigorous imprisonment for nine years along with a fine of Rs.\n80,000/- and in default of payment, to further undergo two months of simple\nimprisonment. The benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C. was extended to her vide\n\njudgment dated 23.10.2023.\n\n3. Aggrieved from her conviction and sentence, the petitioner preferred an\nappeal before the learned Lahore High Court, Multan Bench Multan, but the same\nwas dismissed vide judgment dated 15.01.2025 (“impugned judgment”).\n\n4. The instant petition has now been preferred by the petitioner-convict\nbefore this under Article 185(3) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of\nPakistan, 1973, assailing the impugned judgment of the learned Lahore High\nCourt, Multan Bench dated 15.01.2025.\n\n3. Arguments heard and record as well as evidence perused.\n\n6. The occurrence as alleged in the FIR, took place on 19.11.2022 at 08:00\na.m. The place of occurrence, as shown in the site plan Exh.PD, is a straight kacha\nroad leading for the East to the West, adjacent to the LBDC Canal near kachi\nabadi. The presence of the petitioner is shown at the bank of the canal towards the\nSouth. Towards the North of the road lies the canal itself while towards South, the\nkachi abadi of Shareef Colony is situated. A panoramic view of the site plan\nreveals that the place of occurrence is open and visible from a considerable\ndistance, which renders the presence of any one approaching towards the place of\npresence of the petitioner, visible from sufficient long distance. It is not the\nprosecution’s case that the petitioner upon noticing the arrival of police officials,\nmade any attempt to flee or to dispose of the contraband in the nearby canal. In\nthis background, the easy arrest of the petitioner and recovery of narcotics from\nher possession, appears inherently improbable and does not appeal to reason or the\nconduct of an ordinary prudent person. The FIR also contains a categorical\n\nallegation that the petitioner was present at the spot selling narcotics. However,\n\nCrl. P.L.A. No. 379/ 2025 3\n\nno equipments such as digital or manual weighing scales, staplers, small empty\nsachets, paper slips or similar items which are normally kept by the narcotics\nsellers in their possession for selling narcotics in small quantity has been shown\nrecovered. Neither any alleged customer was arrested at the spot nor has the\nprosecution associated any customer as a witness to lend credence to the allegation\nof the sale of narcotics against the petitioner. The site plan (Exh.PD) is silent with\nregard to the presence of any customer and the presence or positioning of the\nseizing officer, any accompanying police officials, or the witness to the alleged\nrecovery proceedings. This glaring omission from the prosecution’s own\ndocumentary evidence undermines the procedural sanctity and evidentiary\n\nreliability of the recovery proceedings.\n\na. We have also observed that contraband narcotics allegedly recovered from\nthe petitioner were seized on 19.11.2022; however, the samples were dispatched\nfor chemical analysis to the PFSA on 23.11.2022, after a delay of 4 days for which\nno explanation, much less plausible, has been furnished by the prosecution. In\ncases involving recovery of narcotic contraband, the chemical analysis report\nconstitutes the cornerstone of the prosecution’s evidence. Such an inordinate delay\nin forwarding the seized items to PFSA inevitably casts a shadow of doubt on the\nintegrity and authenticity of the samples. In such view of the matter the possibility\nof tampering, substitution, or contamination of the seized narcotics cannot be\n\nexcluded.\n\n8. Yet there is another aspect which also makes the case of the prosecution\ndoubtp[he petitioner has brought on record the Call Data Records (CDRs) of the\nseizing officer Ghulam Abbas, SI, and Lady Constable Aqsa Saddique (PW-1),\nwhich were not effectively rebutted by the prosecution. The CDRs reveal that at\nthe time of occurrence, the mobile device attributed to PW-1 was located in Chak\nNo. 1, Tehsil Burewala, District Vehari, far away from the place of occurrence.\nSimilarly, the mobile data pertaining to SI Ghulam Abbas indicates his mobile cell\nnumber was connected to a cell tower situated in the area of Yosefwala other than\nthe place of occurrence. The mere denial by the said prosecution witnesses that\ntheir mobile phones were not in their possession at the material time, unsupported\nby any corroborative evidence such as the production of a second SIM, mobile\nswap record, or any logical explanation, does not suffice to rebut the documentary\nevidence produced by the petitioner. It is trite law that where circumstances create\nreasonable doubt in a prudent mind regarding the truth of the prosecution's case,\n\nthe accused is entitled to the benefit of such doubt as a matter of right, not of\n\nCri. P.L.A. No. 379/ 2025 4\n\nconcession. The doubts in the present case are not speculative or imaginary but are\nborne out of material contradictions and improbable aspects of the prosecution’s\n\ncase, which remain unexplained and unaddressed.\n\nou: In response to Question No.6 in her statement recorded under Section 342\nCr.P.C, the petitioner has categorically stated that she was apprehended by the\npolice from her residence a day prior to the registration of the instant FIR. The\npolice demanded a huge amount for her release and upon her refusal, she was\nfalsely implicated in the present case. In support of her stance, the petitioner has\nalso referred to case FIR No.1045/2020 under Section 9-c of the Control of\nNarcotic Substances Act, 1997, lodged at Police Station Ghalla Mandi. According\nto the petitioner, in the aforesaid case 12 gold earrings and a koka (nose ornament)\nwere forcibly removed from her person by the police but were neither reflected in\nthe recovery memo nor in the written complaint. It is her claim that the said gold\nornaments were subsequently handed over to her husband, indicating police intent\nto misappropriate her belongings. To substantiate this version, the petitioner\nproduced the statements of prosecution witnesses recorded in the said case\nincluding Lady Constable Sajida Kausar No.264/LC who had acknowledged that\nthe aforementioned gold items were indeed taken from the petitioner. Mushtaq Gul\nSI (PW-4), also admitted in his testimony that the same were later returned to the\npetitioner’s husband. This sequence of events were in two separate criminal cases\nwere registered against the petitioner within the same police station, and where\nboth share common factual threads, raises serious questions about the\nprosecution’s case. The consistent claim of the petitioner, supported by\ndepositions from prosecution witnesses in the earlier case, lends material credence\nto her defence narrative. In such circumstances, the possibility of mala fide on the\npart of the police cannot be ruled out, particularly where animus and prior\n\nmisconduct stand demonstrated on the record.\n\n10. In a criminal case, it is the duty of the Court to review the entire evidence\nthat has been produced by the prosecution and the defence. If, after an\nexamination of the whole evidence, the Court is of the opinion that there is a\nreasonable possibility that the defence put forward by the accused might be true, it\nis clear that such a view reacts on the whole prosecution case. In these\ncircumstances, the accused is entitled to the benefit of doubt, not as a matter of\ngrace, but as of right, because the prosecution has not proved its case beyond\nreasonable doubt. Viewed in totality, the surrounding circumstances significantly\n\nreinforce the defence narrative and cast doubt on the prosecution’s narrative.\n\nes\n\n»\nCri. P.L.A. No. 379/ 2025 5\n\nTherefore, the instant petition is converted into an appeal and is allowed. The\nconviction and sentence of the petitioner/appellant are set aside; the petitioner is\n\nacquitted, and shall be set at liberty forthwith if not required in any other case.\n\nIslamabad\n30.05.2025.\nM.

A panoramic view of the site plan reveals that the place of occurrence is open and visible from a considerable distance, which renders the presence of any one approaching towards the place of presence of the petitioner, visible from sufficient long distance. It is not the prosecution s case that the petitioner upon noticing the arrival of police officials, made any attempt to flee or to dispose of the contraband in the nearby canal. In this background, the easy arrest of the petitioner and recovery of narcotics from her possession, appears inherently improbable and does not appeal to reason or the conduct of an ordinary prudent person. The FIR also contains a categorical allegation that the petitioner was present at the spot selling narcotics. However, Crl. P.L.A. No. 379/ 2025 3 no equipments such as digital or manual weighing scales, staplers, small empty sachets, paper slips or similar items which are normally kept by the narcotics sellers in their possession for selling narcotics in small quantity has been shown recovered. Neither any alleged customer was arrested at the spot nor has the prosecution associated any customer as a witness to lend credence to the allegation of the sale of narcotics against the petitioner. The site plan Exh.PD is silent with regard to the presence of any customer and the presence or positioning of the seizing officer, any accompanying police officials, or the witness to the alleged recovery proceedings. This glaring omission from the prosecution s own documentary evidence undermines the procedural sanctity and evidentiary reliability of the recovery proceedings. a. We have also observed that contraband narcotics allegedly recovered from the petitioner were seized on 19.11.2022; however, the samples were dispatched for chemical analysis to the PFSA on 23.11.2022, after a delay of 4 days for which no explanation, much less plausible, has been furnished by the prosecution. In cases involving recovery of narcotic contraband, the chemical analysis report constitutes the cornerstone of the prosecution s evidence. Such an inordinate delay in forwarding the seized items to PFSA inevitably casts a shadow of doubt on the integrity and authenticity of the samples. In such view of the matter the possibility of tampering, substitution, or contamination of the seized narcotics cannot be excluded. 8. Yet there is another aspect which also makes the case of the prosecution doubtp he petitioner has brought on record the Call Data Records CDRs of the seizing officer Ghulam Abbas, SI, and Lady Constable Aqsa Saddique PW-1 , which were not effectively rebutted by the prosecution. The CDRs reveal that at the time of occurrence, the mobile device attributed to PW-1 was located in Chak No. 1, Tehsil Burewala, District Vehari, far away from the place of occurrence. Similarly, the mobile data pertaining to SI Ghulam Abbas indicates his mobile cell number was connected to a cell tower situated in the area of Yosefwala other than the place of occurrence. The mere denial by the said prosecution witnesses that their mobile phones were not in their possession at the material time, unsupported by any corroborative evidence such as the production of a second SIM, mobile swap record, or any logical explanation, does not suffice to rebut the documentary evidence produced by the petitioner. It is trite law that where circumstances create reasonable doubt in a prudent mind regarding the truth of the prosecution s case, the accused is entitled to the benefit of such doubt as a matter of right, not of Cri. P.L.A. No. 379/ 2025 4 concession. The doubts in the present case are not speculative or imaginary but are borne out of material contradictions and improbable aspects of the prosecution s case, which remain unexplained and unaddressed. ou: In response to Question No.6 in her statement recorded under Section 342 Cr.P.C, the petitioner has categorically stated that she was apprehended by the police from her residence a day prior to the registration of the instant FIR. The police demanded a huge amount for her release and upon her refusal, she was falsely implicated in the present case. In support of her stance, the petitioner has also referred to case FIR No.1045/2020 under Section 9-c of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, lodged at Police Station Ghalla Mandi. According to the petitioner, in the aforesaid case 12 gold earrings and a koka nose ornament were forcibly removed from her person by the police but were neither reflected in the recovery memo nor in the written complaint. It is her claim that the said gold ornaments were subsequently handed over to her husband, indicating police intent to misappropriate her belongings. To substantiate this version, the petitioner produced the statements of prosecution witnesses recorded in the said case including Lady Constable Sajida Kausar No.264/LC who had acknowledged that the aforementioned gold items were indeed taken from the petitioner. Mushtaq Gul SI PW-4 , also admitted in his testimony that the same were later returned to the petitioner s husband. This sequence of events were in two separate criminal cases were registered against the petitioner within the same police station, and where both share common factual threads, raises serious questions about the prosecution s case. The consistent claim of the petitioner, supported by depositions from prosecution witnesses in the earlier case, lends material credence to her defence narrative. In such circumstances, the possibility of mala fide on the part of the police cannot be ruled out, particularly where animus and prior misconduct stand demonstrated on the record. 10. In a criminal case, it is the duty of the Court to review the entire evidence that has been produced by the prosecution and the defence. If, after an examination of the whole evidence, the Court is of the opinion that there is a reasonable possibility that the defence put forward by the accused might be true, it is clear that such a view reacts on the whole prosecution case. In these circumstances, the accused is entitled to the benefit of doubt, not as a matter of grace, but as of right, because the prosecution has not proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. Viewed in totality, the surrounding circumstances significantly reinforce the defence narrative and cast doubt on the prosecution s narrative. es Cri. P.L.A.

Respondent(s)\nFor the Petitioner(s) : Mr. Ibad-ur-Rehman Lodhi, ASC\n\nSyed Rifaqat Hussain Shah, AOR\nFor the Respondent(s) : NLR.\nDate of Hearing : 13.05.2025\nORDER\n\nMazhar Alam Khan Miankhel, J:- The petitioners\nbeing defendants in the main suit for possession of the suit\nproperty have impugned the order dated 13.11.2024 of the Lahore\nHigh Court, Multan Bench, Multan (the High Court), whereby the\nconcurrent findings of decreeing the suit of the respondents by the\ntwo Courts below were upheld and the civil revision of the\npetitioners was dismissed.\n\n2. We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioners\nand have also gone through the available record.\n\n3. The record of the case reveals that the respondents,\nbeing owner of the property, on the strength of registered sale\n\ndeeds, filed a suit for possession and mesne profit by alleging that\n\n20-Civil Petition No.182 of 2025\n\nthe present petitioners have illegally and unlawfully occupied their\nproperty. The suit of the respondents though was contested by the\npetitioners by filing their written statements but after recording of\nevidence, the same was decreed by the trial Court and the said\ndecree was maintained by the appellate Court and the High Court\nby dismissing their appeal and civil revision respectively.\n\n4. The learned counsel for the petitioners at the very\noutset was asked that as to how he would defend the concurrent\nfindings of facts rendered by the High Court as well as the two\nCourts below, he frankly submitted at the bar that he is not going\nto touch the merits of the case, rather he would like to argue his\ncase only on three points, namely, (i) Mesne profit (ii) Res Judicata\n(ili) Refusal of additional documents by the appellate Court. This\nwould simply mean that ownership of the respondents is out of\nquestion and the possession of the petitioners over the suit\nproperty has been established to be illegal and unlawful, as they\nduring the course of trial failed to justify their possession over the\nsuit property. The trial Court while granting the decree in favour of\nthe respondents refused to award mesne profit for want of proof\nbut the appellate Court while dismissing the appeal of the\npetitioners allowed the cross objections of the respondents by\nawarding mesne profit to the tune of Rs.10,000/- per month with\n10% annual increase. When ownership and the possession of this\nproperty by the respondents goes unrebutted what legal strength\nand force would have the points to be argued by the learned\n\ncounsel for the petitioners is the question requiring consideration.\n\n20-Civil Petition No.182 of 2025\n\n5. The learned counsel for the petitioners argued that\ngrant/imposition of mesne profit was based on no cogent reason\nand there was no evidence of the respondents regarding the same\nwhich on the face of it is illegal, unlawful and unwarranted under\nthe law. He went on to argue that the mesne profit has only been\ndefined under Section 2 (12) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908\n(CPC) but nowhere a specific criteria for such grant/award is\nprovided.\n\n6. Here in this case the claim of the respondents was for\npossession of the suit property along-with mesne profit. This is an\nadmitted and established fact on the record that the respondents\nare the owners of the suit property, which was illegally and\nunlawfully occupied by the petitioners without any legal\njustification. It is an established fact on the record that the suit\nproperty is situated within the city and has got a better location\nand the potential value. The case of the respondents has also been\nfurther strengthened when the learned counsel for the petitioners\nrefused to argue his petition on merits of the case.\n\nThough the trial Court declined to grant mesne profit for\nwant of proof but the appellate Court on acceptance of cross\nobjections of the respondents granted/awarded the mesne profit to\nthe tune of Rs.10,000/- per month by giving reasons in para-14 of\nits judgment and that reasoning has not been denied or shattered.\nie; The learned counsel for the petitioners in support of\nhis submissions placed reliance on the judgments of Fateh Chand\nvs. Balkishan Dass (AIR 1963 Supreme Court 1405 (v 50 C 204),\n\nHidayatullah and _another vs. Khurshid Khan (1987 CLC 832) and\n\n20-Civil Petition No.182 of 2025\n\nThe Aministrator, Lahore Municipal Corporation, Lahore vs. Abdul\nHamid and others (1987 CLC 1261).\n\n8. We have gone through the judgments so referred by\nthe learned counsel for the petitioners and have also gone through\nthe available record. These judgments are distinguishable and\nhave no bearing on the merits of this case.\n\n9. No doubt that mesne profit has been defined in Section\n2(12) of the CPC but no specific criteria for award of mesne profit\nexcept Rule 12 of Order XX CPC is provided. This rule provides a\nmechanism for assessment of quantum of mesne profit. For ease of\n\nreference both are reproduced as under: -\n\nSection 2(12) of the Code of Civil Procedure\n(CPC) defines \"mesne profits\". Mesne profits\nrefer to the profits that a person wrongfully in\npossession of property either actually received or\ncould have received with ordinary diligence,\nincluding interest, but excluding profits due to\nimprovements made by the wrongful\npossessor. In essence, it's compensation for the\nloss of income or benefit to the rightful owner\n\ndue to the wrongful occupation of their\n\nproperty.”\n\nOrder XX, Rule 12 of the Civil Procedure\nCode (CPC) deals with decrees related to\n\npossession and mesne profits. It allows the court\nto order an inquiry into the amount of mesne\nprofits payable by a defendant who was in\npossession of a property, and to pass a final\ndecree accordingly. This rule is _ particularly\n\nrelevant in cases where a plaintiff seeks to\n\n20-Civil Petition No.182 of 2025\n\nrecover possession of property and damages for\n\nthe defendant's unlawful use of the property.”\n\nA bare perusal of the above rule would make it confirm that\nno hard and fast mechanism/rules can be made in this regard and\nthe criteria for determining the quantum of mesne profit is subject\nto enquiry if the trial Court so directs. This would mean that the\nquantum of award of mesne profit would depend on case to case\nbasis.\n\n10. Here in this case one of the respondents while\nappearing as witness claimed Rs.50,000/- per month along-with\n10% annual increase because of the location of the suit property\nbut this was not accepted by the trial Court but the appellate\nCourt while accepting their cross objections validly gave sound\nreasons for such award. The argument of the learned counsel for\nthe petitioners that despite the specific ground raised in the civil\nrevision, the learned Judge in Chambers did not give any findings\non the same appears to be misconceived.\n\nDAs With regard to the said argument of the learned\ncounsel, we are of the considered view that no doubt a specific\nground was taken by the petitioners but at the time of hearing\nwhat was argued before the Court was reproduced in the\nimpugned order. This would mean that this plea was not argued\nbefore the Court at the time of hearing. Besides the above, the\npetitioners have not taken any specific ground qua mesne profit in\nthis petition for leave to appeal. This would amount to an\nacceptance of all the findings on the said question by the\n\npetitioners. So this argument of the learned counsel has no force at\n\n20-Civil Petition No.182 of 2025\n\nall and legally cannot be allowed to argue a new ground, which is\nnot raised in the memo of petition, unless specially permitted by\nthe Court to argue.\n\n12. Turning to the other argument of the learned counsel\nregarding bar of present suit under Section 11 of CPC. No doubt\nthe petitioners have raised a preliminary objection in their written\nstatement in this regard but nothing in support of their argument\nhas been placed before the Court. It is very strange to observe that\nalmost entire record of the case has been annexed with this\npetition but the evidence of the petitioners has not been appended\neither intentionally or for any other purpose/reason best known to\nthem.\n\n13. From perusal of the record, we are unable to see any\nprevious decision qua the suit property between the same parties.\nMere alleging a specific plea cannot legally be considered as\nsufficient unless proved on the record. We have also noted that\nPetitioner No.1-Iftikhar Ali Abbasi had posed himself to be the\nspecial attorney of the legal heirs of Muhammad Shamim Khan in\nthe suit titled as Mst. Tayyaba Khurram and others vs. Province of\nPunjab and filed a suit for declaration on their behalf, copy of\nwhich is Exhibit P-11 but Tayyaba Khurram herself appeared in\nthe Court on 29.07.2016 and recorded her statement (Exh.P-13)\nthat they have not given any power of attorney to Iftikhar Ali\nAbbasi (Petitioner No.1) and they also have no concern with the\nproperty of Dr. Amjad Pervez etc., the suit property. This fact alone\n\nwould be sufficient to reflect the conduct of the petitioners. So the\n\n20-Civil Petition No.182 of 2025\n\nargument of the learned counsel qua res judicata has no force at\nall.\n\n14. Now comes the argument of the learned counsel\nregarding additional evidence under Rule 27 of Order XLI of the\nCPC. No doubt the petitioners had applied for additional evidence\nand the law on the subject is very much settled but it cannot be\nclaimed as of right and it is for the Court to decide whether any\ndocument to be produced or any witness to be examined to enable\nthe Court to pronounce the judgment or for any other substantial\ncause and also when the Court from whose decree the appeal is\npreferred has refused to admit such additional evidence and for\nallowing such evidence to be recorded, the Court has to record\nreasons for such permission. For ready reference, Order XLI, Rule\n27 of the CPC is reproduced as under: -\n\n“Order XLI, Rule 27 of the Code of Civil\nProcedure (CPC) in India allows an appellate\ncourt to admit additional evidence in certain\ncircumstances. This rule is an exception to the\ngeneral principle that appeals should be decided\nsolely on the evidence presented at the trial\nlevel. The appellate court can permit additional\nevidence if it deems it necessary to pronounce a\nfair judgment, if the trial court refused to admit\nevidence that should have been admitted, or for\n\nany other substantial cause.”\n15. The perusal of the record would reveal that the\npetitioners have failed to establish their nexus with the suit\n\nproperty except alleging an agreement to sell with legal heirs of\n\nShamim Khan for which till date no suit for specific performance\n\n20-Civil Petition No.182 of 2025\n\nhas been filed by them. It will not be out of place to mention here\nthat the suit property and property owned by the legal heirs of\nShamim Khan though adjacent but two separate properties. The\nperusal of the application for additional evidence moved by the\npetitioners would reflect that no particulars and details of the\ndocuments to be produced as additional evidence has been given\nby them. Mere a vague application in this regard would not suffice\nthe purpose of an application under Rule 27 ibid. No doubt, as per\nsettled law, the appellate Court was duty bound to decide the said\napplication for one way or the other but has failed to do so but in\nthe peculiar circumstances of the instant case no fruitful purpose\nwould be achieved by sending the case back to the appellate Court\nfor decision of the application by setting aside all the judgments\nand decrees especially when the petitioners have bitterly failed to\nprove any nexus with the suit property and justify their unlawful\npossession. It would cause no prejudice to the petitioners and as\nsuch not following the settled law of the land would not be harmful\nfor the petitioners.\n\n16, For what has been discussed above, we are of the view\nthat the instant petition is meritless, hence the same is dismissed\n\nand leave refused. The costs shall follow the event.\n\nIslamabad\n\n13.05.2025\n\nAPPROVED FOR REPORTING\n‘Rabbani*/",

The record of the case reveals that the respondents, being owner of the property, on the strength of registered sale deeds, filed a suit for possession and mesne profit by alleging that 20-Civil Petition No.182 of 2025 the present petitioners have illegally and unlawfully occupied their property. The suit of the respondents though was contested by the petitioners by filing their written statements but after recording of evidence, the same was decreed by the trial Court and the said decree was maintained by the appellate Court and the High Court by dismissing their appeal and civil revision respectively. 4. The learned counsel for the petitioners at the very outset was asked that as to how he would defend the concurrent findings of facts rendered by the High Court as well as the two Courts below, he frankly submitted at the bar that he is not going to touch the merits of the case, rather he would like to argue his case only on three points, namely, i Mesne profit ii Res Judicata ili Refusal of additional documents by the appellate Court. This would simply mean that ownership of the respondents is out of question and the possession of the petitioners over the suit property has been established to be illegal and unlawful, as they during the course of trial failed to justify their possession over the suit property. The trial Court while granting the decree in favour of the respondents refused to award mesne profit for want of proof but the appellate Court while dismissing the appeal of the petitioners allowed the cross objections of the respondents by awarding mesne profit to the tune of Rs.10,000/- per month with 10 annual increase. When ownership and the possession of this property by the respondents goes unrebutted what legal strength and force would have the points to be argued by the learned counsel for the petitioners is the question requiring consideration. 20-Civil Petition No.182 of 2025 5. The learned counsel for the petitioners argued that grant/imposition of mesne profit was based on no cogent reason and there was no evidence of the respondents regarding the same which on the face of it is illegal, unlawful and unwarranted under the law. He went on to argue that the mesne profit has only been defined under Section 2 12 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 CPC but nowhere a specific criteria for such grant/award is provided. 6. Here in this case the claim of the respondents was for possession of the suit property along-with mesne profit. This is an admitted and established fact on the record that the respondents are the owners of the suit property, which was illegally and unlawfully occupied by the petitioners without any legal justification. It is an established fact on the record that the suit property is situated within the city and has got a better location and the potential value. The case of the respondents has also been further strengthened when the learned counsel for the petitioners refused to argue his petition on merits of the case. Though the trial Court declined to grant mesne profit for want of proof but the appellate Court on acceptance of cross objections of the respondents granted/awarded the mesne profit to the tune of Rs.10,000/- per month by giving reasons in para-14 of its judgment and that reasoning has not been denied or shattered. ie; The learned counsel for the petitioners in support of his submissions placed reliance on the judgments of Fateh Chand vs. Balkishan Dass AIR 1963 Supreme Court 1405 v 50 C 204 , Hidayatullah and another vs. Khurshid Khan 1987 CLC 832 and 20-Civil Petition No.182 of 2025 The Aministrator, Lahore Municipal Corporation, Lahore vs. Abdul Hamid and others 1987 CLC 1261 . 8. We have gone through the judgments so referred by the learned counsel for the petitioners and have also gone through the available record. These judgments are distinguishable and have no bearing on the merits of this case. 9. No doubt that mesne profit has been defined in Section 2 12 of the CPC but no specific criteria for award of mesne profit except Rule 12 of Order XX CPC is provided. This rule provides a mechanism for assessment of quantum of mesne profit. For ease of reference both are reproduced as under: - Section 2 12 of the Code of Civil Procedure CPC defines mesne profits . Mesne profits refer to the profits that a person wrongfully in possession of property either actually received or could have received with ordinary diligence, including interest, but excluding profits due to improvements made by the wrongful possessor. In essence, it s compensation for the loss of income or benefit to the rightful owner due to the wrongful occupation of their property. Order XX, Rule 12 of the Civil Procedure Code CPC deals with decrees related to possession and mesne profits. It allows the court to order an inquiry into the amount of mesne profits payable by a defendant who was in possession of a property, and to pass a final decree accordingly. This rule is particularly relevant in cases where a plaintiff seeks to 20-Civil Petition No.182 of 2025 recover possession of property and damages for the defendant s unlawful use of the property. A bare perusal of the above rule would make it confirm that no hard and fast mechanism/rules can be made in this regard and the criteria for determining the quantum of mesne profit is subject to enquiry if the trial Court so directs. This would mean that the quantum of award of mesne profit would depend on case to case basis. 10. Here in this case one of the respondents while appearing as witness claimed Rs.50,000/- per month along-with 10 annual increase because of the location of the suit property but this was not accepted by the trial Court but the appellate Court while accepting their cross objections validly gave sound reasons for such award. The argument of the learned counsel for the petitioners that despite the specific ground raised in the civil revision, the learned Judge in Chambers did not give any findings on the same appears to be misconceived. DAs With regard to the said argument of the learned counsel, we are of the considered view that no doubt a specific ground was taken by the petitioners but at the time of hearing what was argued before the Court was reproduced in the impugned order. This would mean that this plea was not argued before the Court at the time of hearing. Besides the above, the petitioners have not taken any specific ground qua mesne profit in this petition for leave to appeal. This would amount to an acceptance of all the findings on the said question by the petitioners. So this argument of the learned counsel has no force at 20-Civil Petition No.182 of 2025 all and legally cannot be allowed to argue a new ground, which is not raised in the memo of petition, unless specially permitted by the Court to argue. 12. Turning to the other argument of the learned counsel regarding bar of present suit under Section 11 of CPC. No doubt the petitioners have raised a preliminary objection in their written statement in this regard but nothing in support of their argument has been placed before the Court. It is very strange to observe that almost entire record of the case has been annexed with this petition but the evidence of the petitioners has not been appended either intentionally or for any other purpose/reason best known to them. 13. From perusal of the record, we are unable to see any previous decision qua the suit property between the same parties. Mere alleging a specific plea cannot legally be considered as sufficient unless proved on the record. We have also noted that Petitioner No.1-Iftikhar Ali Abbasi had posed himself to be the special attorney of the legal heirs of Muhammad Shamim Khan in the suit titled as Mst. Tayyaba Khurram and others vs. Province of Punjab and filed a suit for declaration on their behalf, copy of which is Exhibit P-11 but Tayyaba Khurram herself appeared in the Court on 29.07.2016 and recorded her statement Exh.P-13 that they have not given any power of attorney to Iftikhar Ali Abbasi Petitioner No.1 and they also have no concern with the property of Dr. Amjad Pervez etc., the suit property. This fact alone would be sufficient to reflect the conduct of the petitioners. So the 20-Civil Petition No.182 of 2025 argument of the learned counsel qua res judicata has no force at all. 14. Now comes the argument of the learned counsel regarding additional evidence under Rule 27 of Order XLI of the CPC. No doubt the petitioners had applied for additional evidence and the law on the subject is very much settled but it cannot be claimed as of right and it is for the Court to decide whether any document to be produced or any witness to be examined to enable the Court to pronounce the judgment or for any other substantial cause and also when the Court from whose decree the appeal is preferred has refused to admit such additional evidence and for allowing such evidence to be recorded, the Court has to record reasons for such permission. For ready reference, Order XLI, Rule 27 of the CPC is reproduced as under: - Order XLI, Rule 27 of the Code of Civil Procedure CPC in India allows an appellate court to admit additional evidence in certain circumstances. This rule is an exception to the general principle that appeals should be decided solely on the evidence presented at the trial level. The appellate court can permit additional evidence if it deems it necessary to pronounce a fair judgment, if the trial court refused to admit evidence that should have been admitted, or for any other substantial cause. 15. The perusal of the record would reveal that the petitioners have failed to establish their nexus with the suit property except alleging an agreement to sell with legal heirs of Shamim Khan for which till date no suit for specific performance 20-Civil Petition No.182 of 2025 has been filed by them. It will not be out of place to mention here that the suit property and property owned by the legal heirs of Shamim Khan though adjacent but two separate properties. The perusal of the application for additional evidence moved by the petitioners would reflect that no particulars and details of the documents to be produced as additional evidence has been given by them. Mere a vague application in this regard would not suffice the purpose of an application under Rule 27 ibid. No doubt, as per settled law, the appellate Court was duty bound to decide the said application for one way or the other but has failed to do so but in the peculiar circumstances of the instant case no fruitful purpose would be achieved by sending the case back to the appellate Court for decision of the application by setting aside all the judgments and decrees especially when the petitioners have bitterly failed to prove any nexus with the suit property and justify their unlawful possession. It would cause no prejudice to the petitioners and as such not following the settled law of the land would not be harmful for the petitioners. 16, For what has been discussed above, we are of the view that the instant petition is meritless, hence the same is dismissed and leave refused. The costs shall follow the event. Islamabad 13.05.2025 APPROVED FOR REPORTING Rabbani /",

JUSTICE AAMER FAROOQ\n\nCPLA No.746-L OF 2025\n[Against judgment dated 11.03.2025 passed in W.P.No.30953 of 2024\nby Lahore High Court, Lahore]\n\nMuhammad Arif Tarar and another\n\n...Petitioner(s)\nVersus\nMatloob Ahmad Warraich and others\n...Respondent(s)\nFor the Petitioner(s) : Mr. Muhammad Saleem, ASC\nFor the Respondent(s) : NLR.\nDate of Hearing : 05.06.2025\nORDER\n\nSHAHID BILAL HASSAN-J: This petition for leave to appeal\nunder Article 185(3) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of\n\nPakistan, 1973 has been preferred against the judgment dated\n11.03.2025 passed by Lahore High Court, Lahore, in W.P. 30953 of\n2024.\n\n2. The relevant facts giving rise to this petition are that the\nRespondent, an overseas Pakistani residing in Canada, is the owner of\na double-storey house bearing House No. 142-E-II, measuring 1 Kanal,\nsituated in M.A. Johar Town, Lahore. The petitioner(s) instituted a suit\nfor specific performance against the respondent(s) based on an alleged\noral agreement to sell the suit property. The respondent(s) contested\nthe suit by filing a written statement, denying the entering and\nexecution of any such agreement. The trial court, out of divergent\npleadings of the parties, framed issues and fixed the suit for recording\nthe petitioners’ evidence, which was repeatedly adjourned. On\n15.06.2022, nearly ten years after the institution of the suit, the\npetitioner filed an application under Order VI Rule 17 of the Code of\n\nCivil Procedure, 1908, seeking the following amendment to the plaint:\n\nC.P.L.A.No.746-L of 2025 2\n\n“...an amendment in the eleventh line of first paragraph of the\n\nplaint (5th line of Page 2) after the word ‘same day’, the following\n\nwords will be added\n\nfn the drawing room of the same house’\n\nThe respondent(s) contested the said application by filing a written\nreply and the learned trial court, after hearing arguments, dismissed\nthe application vide order dated 29.11.2022. The petitioner(s) assailed\nthe said order by filing a revision petition, which was allowed by the\nlearned Additional District Judge, Lahore, on 20.03.2024, thereby\npermitting the purported amendment. The respondent(s) then filed a\nwrit petition before the Lahore High Court challenging the order of the\nAdditional District Judge concerned. Through its order dated\n11.03.2025, the Lahore High Court accepted the writ petition, thereby\nsetting aside the revision order and dismissing the petitioner’s\namendment application; hence, the instant petition.\n3. Heard. For ease of reference, Order VI Rule 17 of the Code of\nCivil Procedure, 1908 is reproduced as hereunder;\n\n“Order VI — Pleadings Generally\n\n17. Amendment of pleadings.\n\nThe Court may at any stage of the proceedings allow either party\n\nto alter or amend his pleadings in such manner and on such\n\nterms as may be just, and all such amendments shall be made as\n\nmay be necessary for the purpose of determining the real\n\nquestions in controversy between the parties.”\nIn determining the propriety of the impugned judgment, it is necessary\nto revisit the governing legal principles concerning amendment of\npleadings. At the outset and from a plain reading of this provision, it is\nevident that the Court is empowered to allow a party to amend their\npleadings, particularly where such an amendment is necessary to\ndetermine the real issue in controversy between the parties. This\npower, in the express terms of the provision and as affirmed in Ghulam\n\nNabi vs. Sardar Nazir Ahmed (1985 SCMR 824), can be exercised, at\n\nany time, during the pendency of such proceedings and even after the\npassage of the decree at the appellate stage or at the stage of revision\nin the highest Court.\n\n4. While it is true that the courts are empowered under Order VI\nRule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 to permit amendment “at\nany stage of the proceeding,” this discretion is to be exercised with\n\ncaution and only in furtherance of justice. This Court has held in\n\nC.P.L.A.No.746-L of 2025 3\n\nAbaid Ullah Malik vs. Additional District Judge, Mianwali_and_others\n(PLD 2013 SC 239) that although the rule ibid is to be construed\n\nliberally, certain guardrails must be strictly observed. An amendment\ncannot be allowed if it alters the nature of the suit, seeks to withdraw\nadmissions previously made, is tainted with mala fide intent, causes\nprejudice to the opposite party, or is designed to overcome evidentiary\ncontradictions or prior judicial determinations. Courts must be vigilant\nin evaluating the motive behind the request, the stage at which it is\nbrought and its impact on the rights of the opposite party.\n\nIn the present case, the petitioner sought to amend a factual\nassertion—specifically, relating to the ‘alleged place’ where the oral\nagreement was made—after a delay of ten years. Such a request raises\nserious questions about the bona fides of the petitioner(s). This Court\n\nhas held in Muhammad Akram and _another vs. Altaf Ahmad (PLD 2003\n\nSC 688) that where an amendment is sought after an inordinate delay,\nwithout adequate explanation, the delay itself, though not conclusive,\nbecomes a weighty factor. An amendment of such a nature, introduced\nafter the close of pleadings and during the trial phase, is likely to\nprejudice the opposing party by shifting the nature or focus of the\ncontroversy.\n\n5. Additionally, as held in Sardar Muhammad_Naseem_ Khan vs.\nReturning Officer, PP-12 and others (2015 SCMR 1698), pleadings frame\n\nthe boundaries of a party’s case and the parties are bound to lead\nevidence in line with them. A party is not permitted to go beyond its\npleadings and cannot lead or rely upon evidence that is inconsistent\nwith what has been pleaded; even if such evidence is brought on\nrecord, it must be ignored. In this context, any belated amendment\nthat introduces a new factual assertion must be examined with\nheightened scrutiny.\n\nSimilarly, in Mst. Noor Khatoon through Legal Heirs and_another\nvs. Muhammad_Shafi (2003 SCMR 542), the Court disallowed an\n\namendment at a belated stage where the party had failed to raise the\nrelevant plea earlier despite having full knowledge of the underlying\nfacts. The petitioner(s) in that case sought to introduce a new line of\nargument by way of amendment which had not been raised before the\nappropriate forum at the proper time. The Court held that failure to\n\nact diligently bars a party from invoking the court’s jurisdiction under\n\nC.P.L.A.No.746-L of 2025 4\n\nOrder VI Rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 at a later stage,\neven where such power exists.\n\n6. When the principle settled in the above said precedents are\napplied to the instant case, it can safely be held that the petitioners’\namendment in this case was a direct attempt to support and fortify a\ndisputed fact, central to the dispute over the existence of the alleged\nagreement—its location. The intention behind the amendment was not\nto clarify a ‘typographical error’, which this Court has permitted,! nor\nwas it to rectify an ‘accidental omission’ as in Dausa_and others vs.\n\nProvince of the Punjab _and_others (2016 SCMR 1621), where the\n\nSupreme Court permitted a correction of the mortgage date as it was\nan undisputed formal clarification. In contrast, the amendment sought\nhere goes to the root of the case which would prejudice the\nrespondent(s)’ stance. Hence, it would be impermissible for this Court\nto allow such an amendment.\n\n7. To build upon the element of prejudice to the opposing party and\nwhy it cannot be overlooked, the courts have consistently warned,\nnotably in Secretary to Government of West Pakistan v. Kazi Abdul Kafil\n(PLD 1978 SC 242), that an amendment should not be allowed where it\n\nalters the litigation landscape in a way that disadvantages the\nopposing party who relied upon the original pleading in the conduct of\ntheir case. In the case at hand, the proposed amendment had the\neffect of adding a key factual detail long after the other side had\ncommitted to a line of defence based on the original version of events.\n\n8. The delay of ten years in seeking this amendment in absence of\nany compelling explanation is also relevant in the present case, as\n\nreaffirmed in Muhammad Akram v. Altaf Ahmad (PLD 2003 SC 688), an\n\namendment sought at a late stage—especially after years of litigation,\nfiling of successive pleadings, and recording of evidence—without any\ncredible justification, creates a strong inference against the party's\ncredibility. A sudden recollection of a material fact so central to the\npetitioner(s)’ case, coming after a decade, raises serious doubts as to\nthe authenticity of the assertion and undermines the fairness of\nallowing such a change. Similarly, in Mst. Ghulam Bibi and others vs.\n\nSarsa Khan _and others (PLD 1985 SC 345), the Court acknowledged\n\nthat while delay alone is not conclusive, it becomes significant when\n\nthe amendment is sought to be introduced after the trial has\n\n1 Qamar-ud-din vs. Muhammad Din and others — PLD 2001 SC 518\n\nC.P.L.A.No.746-L of 2025 5\n\nprogressed substantially. The timing of the amendment request must,\ntherefore, be viewed not in isolation, but in the context of its potential\nto disturb the procedural fairness and substantive rights of the\nopposing party. In the present case, the petitioner(s)’ amendment was\nsought after a decade of pendency, and multiple adjournments, all the\nwhile failing to lead evidence. The attempt to insert a significant\nfactual detail relating to the alleged oral agreement—namely the\nlocation of its execution—after such an extended lapse of time cannot\nbe viewed as a benign clarification. Instead, it appears to be an effort\nto recalibrate the factual matrix of the petitioner(s)’ case in light of the\ntrial’s trajectory. As held in Mst. Ghulam Bibi ibid, this type of\namendment, coming at a late stage justifies close judicial scrutiny and\nmay rightly be refused to preserve the integrity of the proceedings.\n\n9. In view of the above, applying the reasoning of Mst. Ghulam Bibi,\nthe amendment in question cannot be allowed, as it is not only\nsignificantly delayed but also appears to be tactically motivated and\nwould result in prejudicing the opposing party. The petitioner(s)’\nconduct does not merit the equitable indulgence contemplated under\nOrder VI Rule 17 CPC.\n\n10. In light of the settled legal principles and the conduct of the\npetitioner(s), the Lahore High Court’s decision to disallow the\namendment is legally sound and does not warrant interference.\n\n11. For the foregoing reasons, this petition has no merits which is\naccordingly dismissed and leave to appeal refused.\n\n12. These are the detailed reasons for our short order dated\n05.06.2025 which is reproduced here for the completion of the record:\n\n\"For the reasons to be recorded later, the instant petition stands\ndismissed.

            "CleanedText": "ORDER SHAHID BILAL HASSAN-J: This petition for leave to appeal under Article 185 3 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 has been preferred against the judgment dated 11.03.2025 passed by Lahore High Court, Lahore, in W.P. 30953 of 2024. 2. The relevant facts giving rise to this petition are that the Respondent, an overseas Pakistani residing in Canada, is the owner of a double-storey house bearing House No. 142-E-II, measuring 1 Kanal, situated in M.A. Johar Town, Lahore. The petitioner s instituted a suit for specific performance against the respondent s based on an alleged oral agreement to sell the suit property. The respondent s contested the suit by filing a written statement, denying the entering and execution of any such agreement. The trial court, out of divergent pleadings of the parties, framed issues and fixed the suit for recording the petitioners evidence, which was repeatedly adjourned. On 15.06.2022, nearly ten years after the institution of the suit, the petitioner filed an application under Order VI Rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, seeking the following amendment to the plaint: C.P.L.A.No.746-L of 2025 2 ...an amendment in the eleventh line of first paragraph of the plaint 5th line of after the word same day , the following words will be added fn the drawing room of the same house The respondent s contested the said application by filing a written reply and the learned trial court, after hearing arguments, dismissed the application vide order dated 29.11.2022. The petitioner s assailed the said order by filing a revision petition, which was allowed by the learned Additional District Judge, Lahore, on 20.03.2024, thereby permitting the purported amendment. The respondent s then filed a writ petition before the Lahore High Court challenging the order of the Additional District Judge concerned. Through its order dated 11.03.2025, the Lahore High Court accepted the writ petition, thereby setting aside the revision order and dismissing the petitioner s amendment application; hence, the instant petition. 3. Heard. For ease of reference, Order VI Rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 is reproduced as hereunder; Order VI Pleadings Generally 17. Amendment of pleadings. The Court may at any stage of the proceedings allow either party to alter or amend his pleadings in such manner and on such terms as may be just, and all such amendments shall be made as may be necessary for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties. In determining the propriety of the impugned judgment, it is necessary to revisit the governing legal principles concerning amendment of pleadings. At the outset and from a plain reading of this provision, it is evident that the Court is empowered to allow a party to amend their pleadings, particularly where such an amendment is necessary to determine the real issue in controversy between the parties. This power, in the express terms of the provision and as affirmed in Ghulam Nabi vs. Sardar Nazir Ahmed 1985 SCMR 824 , can be exercised, at any time, during the pendency of such proceedings and even after the passage of the decree at the appellate stage or at the stage of revision in the highest Court. 4. While it is true that the courts are empowered under Order VI Rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 to permit amendment at any stage of the proceeding, this discretion is to be exercised with caution and only in furtherance of justice. This Court has held in C.P.L.A.No.746-L of 2025 3 Abaid Ullah Malik vs. Additional District Judge, Mianwali and others PLD 2013 SC 239 that although the rule ibid is to be construed liberally, certain guardrails must be strictly observed. An amendment cannot be allowed if it alters the nature of the suit, seeks to withdraw admissions previously made, is tainted with mala fide intent, causes prejudice to the opposite party, or is designed to overcome evidentiary contradictions or prior judicial determinations. Courts must be vigilant in evaluating the motive behind the request, the stage at which it is brought and its impact on the rights of the opposite party. In the present case, the petitioner sought to amend a factual assertion specifically, relating to the alleged place where the oral agreement was made after a delay of ten years. Such a request raises serious questions about the bona fides of the petitioner s . This Court has held in Muhammad Akram and another vs. Altaf Ahmad PLD 2003 SC 688 that where an amendment is sought after an inordinate delay, without adequate explanation, the delay itself, though not conclusive, becomes a weighty factor. An amendment of such a nature, introduced after the close of pleadings and during the trial phase, is likely to prejudice the opposing party by shifting the nature or focus of the controversy. 5. Additionally, as held in Sardar Muhammad Naseem Khan vs. Returning Officer, PP-12 and others 2015 SCMR 1698 , pleadings frame the boundaries of a party s case and the parties are bound to lead evidence in line with them. A party is not permitted to go beyond its pleadings and cannot lead or rely upon evidence that is inconsistent with what has been pleaded; even if such evidence is brought on record, it must be ignored. In this context, any belated amendment that introduces a new factual assertion must be examined with heightened scrutiny. Similarly, in Mst. Noor Khatoon through Legal Heirs and another vs. Muhammad Shafi 2003 SCMR 542 , the Court disallowed an amendment at a belated stage where the party had failed to raise the relevant plea earlier despite having full knowledge of the underlying facts. The petitioner s in that case sought to introduce a new line of argument by way of amendment which had not been raised before the appropriate forum at the proper time. The Court held that failure to act diligently bars a party from invoking the court s jurisdiction under C.P.L.A.No.746-L of 2025 4 Order VI Rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 at a later stage, even where such power exists. 6. When the principle settled in the above said precedents are applied to the instant case, it can safely be held that the petitioners amendment in this case was a direct attempt to support and fortify a disputed fact, central to the dispute over the existence of the alleged agreement its location. The intention behind the amendment was not to clarify a typographical error , which this Court has permitted,! nor was it to rectify an accidental omission as in Dausa and others vs. Province of the Punjab and others 2016 SCMR 1621 , where the Supreme Court permitted a correction of the mortgage date as it was an undisputed formal clarification. In contrast, the amendment sought here goes to the root of the case which would prejudice the respondent s stance. Hence, it would be impermissible for this Court to allow such an amendment. 7.

It is prudent to note that the respondent did not change or alter her\n\n' Letter No. F.1-260/2012-H-I dated 29.04.2025 issued by the Ministry of National Health Services Regulations and\nCoordination (C.M.A. No. 3555/2025).\n\nC.P.L.A.

Subsequently, during service, the respondent\nchanged her domicile to that of her husband i.e, Province of Balochistan\non 20.10.2018 and formally relinquished her Province of KPK domicile on\n25.10.2018. On the basis of her new domicile, she applied for an\nadvertised post of Associate Professor (Obstetrics & Gynaecology) (BS-19)\nat PIMS against the Balochistan seat. Controversy arose when the\nrespondent, having obtained the requisite departmental no objection\ncertificates (“NOCs”) for applying to the post of Assistant Professor\n(Obstetrics & Gynaecology) (BS-19) on the basis of her Balochistan\ndomicile, got rejected by Federal Public Service Commission (“FPSC”).\nAlthough the respondent successfully passed the written examination,\nher candidature was rejected by the FPSC vide memorandum dated\n10.07.2024, on two grounds: first, that a change of domicile after entry\ninto government service is impermissible; and second, that she lacked the\nrequisite experience for the post. Dissatisfied with the FPSC’s decision,\nthe respondent preferred a departmental representation, which, along\nwith her subsequent review petition, was dismissed through orders dated\n12.09.2024 and 02.10.2024, respectively. However, her appeal under\nSection 7(3)(d) of the FPSC Ordinance, 1977 (“Ordinance”) before the\nIslamabad High Court was allowed vide judgment dated 28.01.2025\n(“impugned judgment”), whereby the impugned decisions rejecting her\ncandidature were set aside. Aggrieved by the impugned judgment, the\npresent petition for leave to appeal has been filed before this Court by the\nFPSC.\n\n2. The learned Additional Attorney General, assisted by\nrepresentatives of the FPSC and MNHS, contended that under the\nEstablishment Division’s Office Manual No. F.8/5/75-WC dated\n12.08.1975 (“O.M. 1975”)?, a married female candidate may adopt her\nhusband’s domicile if applying for a post through “direct recruitment”.\nHowever, it was argued that “direct recruitment” refers solely to first-time\nentry into service, after which the domicile declared at initial induction\nunder Establishment Division Office Manual No. 1/14/71-TRV dated\n20.09.1971 (“O.M. 1971”) becomes final and binding for the duration of\nservice. The High Court, it was submitted, erred in holding that O.M.\n1975 overrides O.M. 1971; instead, both operate in distinct spheres: O.M.\n1975 governs initial appointments, while O.M. 1971 applies post-entry.\n\nPermitting a change of domicile mid-service, it was argued, could lead to\n\n? An Office Manual in Pakistan’s service law framework is a departmental guide for internal procedures. It does not\noverride statutory service rules but can be used to interpret or implement them unless it contradicts a statute or\nconstitutional provision. This is issued under Section 25 of the Civil Servants Act, 1973.\n\nC.P.L.A. No. 651/2025 3\n\narbitrary advantage and disruption of seniority. On the respondent’s\n\nexperience, it was submitted that the certificates were issued by\nunauthorized officials and reflected service on an internal arrangement,\nnot a substantive appointment or promotion to BS-18. Hence, her\nexperience was non-countable. Additionally, the NOC was challenged as\nlegally infirm, allegedly obtained through misrepresentation of domicile.\nAccordingly, the FPSC’s rejection of both her Balochistan domicile and\n\nexperience was defended as lawful.\n\n3. Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent raised several\nobjections to the FPSC’s actions. As a preliminary matter, he contended\nthat the FPSC lacks locus standi to file the petition and cannot be\nrepresented by the State, relying on this Court’s settled jurisprudence.\nOn merits, it was argued that the respondent, having secured the highest\nmarks in the written examination, acquired a vested right to be fairly\nconsidered for appointment, one that could not be arbitrarily denied. He\nfurther submitted that the respondent does not fall within the definition\nof a “civil servant” under the Occupational Groups and Services\n(Probation, Training and Seniority) Rules, 1990, making O.M. 1971\ninapplicable. Since the post was to be filled through “direct recruitment”,\nher husband’s domicile recognized under O.M. 1975 ought to be\nconsidered. “Direct recruitment”, it was emphasized, entails fresh\nappointments distinct from existing service, seniority, or promotion\nstructures, involving independent pay scales and selection procedures.\nThe respondent was said to have met all experiential requirements,\nsupported by a valid experience certificate issued under the Pakistan\nMedical and Dental Council Regulations, 2018 (“PMDC Regulations”). As\nthis certificate had not been challenged through any legal forum, it had\nattained finality. Reference was also made to Rule 14 of the Civil Servants\n(Appointment, Promotion and Transfer) Rules, 1973, which allocates only\nsix percent of seats for Balochistan. It was argued that had the\nrespondent retained her KPK domicile, her selection prospects would\nhave been stronger, undermining allegations of strategic domicile change.\nAccordingly, the FPSC’s rejection of her domicile and experience was\n\ncharacterized as arbitrary, erroneous, and without legal basis.\n\n4. The learned amicus curiae opined that Sections 15 and 16 of\nthe Succession Act, 1925 (“1925 Act”) are inapplicable to the present\nmatter, as their provisions do not extend to Muslims. She further\nsubmitted that the respondent may avail the benefit of O.M. 1975 only if\nthis Court concludes on the factual plane that the advertised post\n\nconstitutes a new post and falls within the scope of “direct recruitment”.\n\nC.P.L.A. No. 651/2025 4\n\n5. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and\n\namicus curiae at length and have carefully examined the impugned\n\njudgment, the applicable law, and the record of the case.\n\nPreliminary Objections: Locus Standi, Representation and_Status of the\n\nRespondent\n\n6. Before addressing the substantive issues, we must first\ndispose of the preliminary objections raised by the respondent. Firstly, he\ncontended that the FPSC lacks locus standi to file the petition relying on\nRahim Foods*. We have examined the said judgement whereby this Court\ncategorically held that the Competition Commission of Pakistan (“CCP”),\nunder the Competition Act, 2010 (“2010 Act”), functions primarily as a\nregulatory body and also as a quasi-judicial forum. However, when CCP\ndecides a matter between rival parties in exercise of its quasi-judicial\npowers, CCP cannot claim to be an aggrieved person for the purposes of\nchallenging a decision before a superior forum.+ No such quasi-\nadjudicatory framework exists under the Ordinance in question®, which\nmerely provides for an administrative review of the FPSC’s own decisions.\nTherefore, the instant case is distinguishable. The impugned rejection of\nthe respondent’s candidature is not a determination made in a quasi-\njudicial capacity of FPSC between contesting parties but rather exercising\nan administrative power of review of its earlier order. Therefore, the\nprecedent cited by the respondent is inapposite, as it pertains to quasi-\njudicial bodies seeking to defend their adjudicatory decisions, which is\nnot the situation here. The objection to the locus standi of the FPSC to\n\nfile the present appeal is misconceived.\n\n7. The second objection challenging the competence of the\nlearned Additional Attorney General to represent the FPSC is equally\nuntenable. As an attached department of the Establishment Division®,\nthe FPSC is a Federal Government entity and, as a matter of settled law,\nmust be represented by government counsel, not private advocates.’ The\nrespondent’s claim of a vested right to appointment on the basis of her\nperformance in the written test is similarly flawed. The FPSC retains the\nauthority to determine eligibility, and mere success in the examination or\n\na conditional recommendation does not confer a vested right to\n\n3 A. Rahim Foods (Pvt.) v. K & N’s Foods (Pvt.) PLD 2023 SC 516.\n\n4 Wafaqi Mohtasib v.

No. 651/2025 5\n\nappointment.’ Further, the argument that the respondent is not a civil\n\nservant lacks merit. It is settled by this Court that a civil servant is\nsomeone who holds a civil post in connection with the affairs of the\nFederation and who has been employed by the competent authority i.e.,\neither by the FPSC or the Provincial Public Service Commission in the\nprescribed manner after following the due process of law and having gone\nthrough the process of competition.? Applying this to the instant case, the\nrespondent was appointed through the KPK Public Service Commission\ni.e., competent authority through an open competition, Moreover, this\nCourt has already held that doctors employed in PIMS and other federal\ninstitutions hold civil posts and are civil servants within the meaning of\nSection 2(1)(b) of the Civil Servants Act, 1973.19 Accordingly, the\nrespondent’s reliance on the inapplicability of O.M. 1971 is misplaced\n\nand does not withstand scrutiny.\n\nThe Legal Doctrine _of Domicile: Origins, Elements, and Contemporary\n\nRelevance\n\n8. Before turning to the core controversy surrounding domicile\nand its bearing on “direct recruitment”, it is instructive to examine the\nlegal doctrine of domicile itself. Modern scholarship traces its origins to\nRoman law, with English Canon Law serving as the vehicle for its\ntransmission into the common law tradition.!! The term “domicile” is\nderived from the Latin domicilium (from domum colere - to inhabit or\ncultivate a home), and its Dutch counterpart woonplaats, both evoking\nthe notion of a permanent legal home “this is where you are, because this\nis where you belong.”!2 Across jurisdictions, legal dictionaries and judicial\npronouncements consistently define domicile as a person’s legal home to\n\nwhich they intend to return whenever absent.!% Lord Chelmsford aptly\n\n8 Paragraph 14(b) of General Instructions of Federal Public Service Commission states that ‘Eligibility of the candidates\nin terms of Recruitment Rules and the advertised conditions shall be determined after the conduct of\nscreening/professional test/descriptive examination. On detailed scrutiny of the applications if they are found ineligible,\ntheir candidatures will be cancelled irrespective of the fact whether they have appeared in the examination/test or even\nqualified therein.’\n\n° Sindh Irrigation and Drainage Authority v.

No. 651/2025 6\n\ndescribed it as the “intention of a permanent home.”!+ Thus, domicile has\n\ntwo essential components: (i) factum - the physical fact of residence;\nand (ii) animus manendi - the intention of remaining there permanently.!5\nImportantly, domicile is not synonymous with residence. While one may\nhave multiple residences, a person can have only one domicile at a time.\nIndeed, even a person with no physical home cannot be without a\ndomicile in law. Domicile may be categorized as: (i) Domicile of origin:\nacquired by operation of law at birth; (ii) Domicile of choice: adopted\nvoluntarily by a legally competent person intending to make a place their\n\npermanent home; and (iii) Domicile of dependence: determined by the\n\ndomicile of another, such as a spouse, parent, or legal guardian.!© It is a\nsettled principle that any person, subject to legal capacity and in\n\naccordance with applicable law, may lawfully change their domicile.\n\n9. Domicile, though often perceived as administrative, is a\nfoundational legal concept that shapes an individual’s access to rights,\nopportunities, and entitlements. It is not merely a declaration of\npermanent residence, but a legal construct that governs access to public\nservices, education, employment, political participation, and regional\nentitlements. Domicile can influence taxation, voting rights, and eligibility\nfor regional quotas in civil service recruitment.!” In Lord Westbury’s\nwords, domicile is “a relation which the law creates between an individual\nand a particular locality or country.”!8 Theories of domicile span several\ndisciplines — law, human geography, and residential mobility, each\nhighlighting how one’s place of habitual residence affects jurisdiction,\nmigration patterns, and settlement dynamics. Accordingly, domicile must\nalways be interpreted in light of the underlying purpose it is meant to\n\nserve.\n\n10. In Pakistan, the concept of domicile is recognized in Part II of\nthe 1925 Act, Section 17 of the Citizenship Act, 1951 (“1951 Act”), and\nthe Schedule to Rule 310-A of the Civil Service Regulations (“CSR”)\nVolume I. These provisions acknowledge changes of domicile through\ndependence, voluntary relocation, choice, or marriage. The procedural\nframework for obtaining, modifying, renewing, or cancelling domicile is\n\noutlined in the Citizenship Rules, 1952.19 This legal understanding of\n\n'4 Waicker v Hume (1858) 10 HLC 124.\n\n'S Peter Stone, Conflict of Laws (Longman Law Series 1995) and District Education Officer (Female), Charsadda v.\nSonia Begum 2023 SCMR 217.\n\n‘6 Paul Torremans, ‘Domicile, Nationality and Residence’ in Paul Torremans (ed), Cheshire, North & Fawcett: Private\nInternational Law (15th edn, OUP 2017).\n\n'7 Anggi Fitratama Rianto Putra and Rifgi Ridlo Phahlevy, ‘The Concept of Domicile in Filling Government Positions\nin the Regions’ (2024) 1(4) Journal of Geography, Regional Planning and Development.\n\n'8 JG Castel, ‘Domicile’ (1958) McGill LJ 179.\n\n'9 Rules 23, 28-B and 30, Citizenship Rules, 1952.\n\n\nC.P.L.A. No. 651/2025 7\n\ndomicile is central to the present controversy, as the respondent claims\n\neligibility for appointment under the province of Balochistan quota on the\nbasis of a changed domicile acquired through marriage. Whether such a\nchange is legally sustainable, for a civil servant, for the purpose of “direct\nrecruitment”, particularly after entry into civil service, lies at the heart of\n\nthe dispute now before this Court.\n\nApplicability of Sections 15 and 16 of the Succession Act, 1925 on Muslims\n\n11. The respondent argued that, by virtue of Sections 15 and 16\nof the 1925 Act that a wife’s domicile automatically shifts to that of her\nhusband upon marriage. However, this contention is legally untenable.\nThese provisions fall under Part II of the 1925 Act, which, by virtue of\nSection 4, expressly excludes their application to Muslims, Hindus,\nBuddhists, Sikhs, and Jainas. The historical context reinforces this\nexclusion. Prior to the Succession Act, 1865, Muslims and Hindus were\ngoverned by their respective personal laws, while other communities were\nsubject to a patchwork of colonial legal principles. The 1925 Act was a\nconsolidating statute aimed at non-Muslim and non-Hindu communities,\ndeliberately preserving the autonomy of personal laws in succession\nmatters for the latter.2° Accordingly, Sections 15 and 16 have no\napplicability to Muslims, and the respondent’s reliance on them is\n\nmisplaced.\n\n12. For civil servants, the applicable domicile regime is set out in\nthe Schedule to Rule 310-A of the CSR, Volume I. This Schedule explicitly\nrecognizes the change of domicile through marriage and other modes, and\naffirms that the domicile of a married woman ordinarily follows that of\nher husband. As the respondent is a civil servant, it is this framework not\nthe 1925 Act or 1951 Act that governs the determination and change of\n\nher domicile.\n\nDomicile and Marriage: Autonomy, Dependency, and the Rights of Women\n\nin Civil Service\n\n13. While CSR recognizes that a married woman may adopt her\nhusband’s domicile by virtue of Item No. 7 of the Schedule to Rule 310-A\nof the CSR. Having established that the respondent’s status as a civil\nservant brings her within the ambit of Rule 310-A, the critical question\nthat arises is whether such adoption is automatic or mandatory; or a\n\nmatter of personal choice under the Item No. 7 of the Schedule and;\n\n?0 Law Commission of India, Report No 247 on Indian Succession Act (Government of India 2014).\n\n\nC.P.L.A. No. 651/2025 8\n\nwhether the domicile of civil servant freezes upon entry into the civil\n\nservice and cannot be altered during service.\n(i) Acquisition of the domicile of the husband is optional\n\n14. To address the first question, it is necessary to examine\nwhether the mere fact of marriage results in a compulsory shift of\ndomicile. There exist interpretational inconsistencies among courts\nregarding whether a wife’s acquisition of her husband’s domicile is a\nmatter of law or choice.?! The traditional common law rule under which\na wife’s domicile followed that of her husband is rooted in the doctrine of\ndependency and aimed at preserving legal unity within the marital\nrelationship. However, this dependency rule has come under strong\ncriticism for subordinating a woman’s agency. Lord Denning famously\ndescribed it as “the last barbarous relic of a wife’s servitude,” calling for\nits abandonment in light of modern principles of equality and autonomy.\nThis rule, born from the doctrine of coverture22 which rendered a married\nwoman “civilly dead” by merging her legal identity into that of her\nhusband has been widely rejected across common law jurisdictions.?°\nLegal reforms in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, and\nSingapore have abolished the automatic domicile rule, affirming a\nwoman’s right to independently determine her legal affiliation.24 Even in\njurisdictions like Malaysia, where no statute has been enacted, courts\nhave recognized a woman’s right to abandon her husband’s domicile and\nassert her own.25 From a constitutional standpoint, tethering a woman’s\nlegal identity and civic entitlements to her husband's domicile infringes\nupon her autonomy, dignity, and equality. The Convention on the\nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (“CEDAW”), to\nwhich Pakistan is a signatory?®, affirms a woman’s right to be free from\nsuch marital subordination and to choose her domicile irrespective of her\nmarital status.2” Accordingly, the proposition that a woman’s domicile\nautomatically changes upon marriage is neither supported by\n\ncontemporary constitutional values nor binding in the absence of express\n\n2!

In the present case, the respondent, by her own\nvolition, opted to adopt her husband’s domicile, which is legally\n\npermissible.\n\n(ii) The domicile freezes on joining the civil service and cannot be changed\n\nduring service in light of O.M. 1971\n\n15. Unlike general domicile concepts rooted in personal identity\nand legal affiliation, the interpretation of domicile for government\nservants must be aligned with the objectives and practical necessities of\nrecruitment policies and service conditions. Domicile must be understood\nin light of the purpose and object of the relevant legal context. In service\nlaw, it is interpreted with reference to recruitment policies and service\nterms.28 The Establishment Division’s O.M. 1971 addresses the issue of\ndomicile change after entry into government service:\nChange of Domicile after entry into Government Service: A question has\narisen whether a government servant who entered service based on the domicile\nof a particular province/region may subsequently change domicile during\nservice. While a government servant, as a Pakistani citizen, may change domicile\nunder law, it has been decided that the domicile declared and accepted at entry\n\nshall be final for the duration of service and no later change shall be recognized\nfor service terms, including postings and transfers. (emphasis supplied)\n\nThe O.M. 1971 permits civil servants irrespective of gender to change\ntheir domicile for purposes related to citizenship rights and obligations.\nHowever, the domicile declared and accepted at entry into civil service\nshall be final for the duration of service and no later change shall be\nrecognized for service terms, including postings and transfers.29 This\nprinciple equally applies to female civil servants. The rationale behind\nthis is that Pakistan, as a constitutional Federation, comprises several\nProvinces with distinct socio-economic profiles and varying levels of\ndevelopment. To ensure equitable representation and fair opportunities\nacross the Federation, the civil service recruitment process allocates\nvacancies based on provincial quotas determined by the domicile of the\ncandidates. Domicile, in this context, serves as a constitutional tool to\npromote inclusivity and national integration by safeguarding the interests\nof less-developed regions and underrepresented populations. Once a\ncandidate enters the civil service against a post allocated to a particular\n\nprovince or region, their domicile is considered “frozen” to maintain the\n\n28 Mauzam Hanif v.

No. 651/2025 10\n\nintegrity of this federal balancing mechanism. It is also important to note\n\nthat permitting the change of domicile may affect the mechanism of\ntransfer and seniority as well. Disregarding seniority undermines\nbureaucratic impartiality, violates constitutional guarantees of due\nprocess and equality (Article 4 and 25 of the Constitution of the Islamic\nRepublic of Pakistan, 1973 (“Constitution”))°° and breeds cynicism within\nthe service. The erosion of seniority norms weakens administrative\nstability.3! Allowing post-induction changes in domicile would not only\nundermine the quota system but also open avenues for manipulation,\nenabling individuals to shift provincial affiliation for personal advantage,\nthereby diluting the constitutional promise of provincial parity. The\nfreezing of domicile thus serves the larger constitutional purpose of\nfederal harmony and administrative fairness within the civil service\n\nstructure of Pakistan.\n\n16. In this context, an unmarried female civil servant such as the\nrespondent while legally entitled to adopt the domicile of her husband\nupon marriage, but for all service-related entitlements and obligations,\nher original domicile (in this case, KPK) continues to be the determining\ndocument. The question that now arises is whether the O.M. 1975 creates\na specific exception that permits a female civil servant to change her\ndomicile (or use her husband’s domicile under the aforesaid O.M.) during\nservice, only in limited cases where appointment to a higher post is\n\nthrough “direct recruitment”?\n\nDirect _Recruitment_of in-service _female_candidates is an exception to\n\ngeneral rule\n\n17. Learned counsel for the respondent relied on O.M. 1975,\narguing that because the advertised post was to be filled by “direct\nrecruitment”, the respondent’s matrimonial domicile cannot be\n\ndisregarded. O.M. 1975 states:\n\nMarried Female Candidates - Determination of Domicile: According to Estt.\nDivision’s O.M. No. 2/2/67 dated August 26, 1968, a candidate’s domicile is\ndetermined by their parents’ domicile or, if the parents of a migrant candidate\nhave not migrated to Pakistan, by the candidate’s own residence and education\nin the province of domicile. The question whether a married female candidate\ncan be deemed to share her husband’s domicile has been considered, and it was\ndecided that for direct recruitment, a married female candidate’s domicile may\nbe accepted as that of her husband.

No. 651/2025 11\n\nThe above shows that a married candidate not yet in service may opt for\n\neither her own or her husband’s domicile, and once chosen, that domicile\nis final for service terms. However, to assess O.M. 1975’s applicability to\na civil servant already in service, three objections raised by the learned\nAdditional Attorney General must be addressed: (i) the advertised post\nwas for initial recruitment not direct recruitment; (ii) direct recruitment\nimplies first entry into service; and (iii) allowing an in-service female civil\nservant to change domicile risks disrupting seniority and service\n\nstructure.\n\nDirect Recruitment and Initial Recruitment are interchangeable terms\n\n18. Having clarified the distinct applicability of O.M. 1975 to\nfemale civil servants, it is essential to address the terminology\nsurrounding recruitment, particularly the distinction or lack thereof\nbetween “direct recruitment” and “initial recruitment,” which forms a\ncritical basis for the arguments advanced. Service rules in Pakistan\nrecognize three modes of appointment®?: (i) initial recruitment, (ii)\npromotion, and (iii) transfer. Initial recruitment is defined as an\nappointment made otherwise than by promotion or transfer, typically\nthrough examination, test, or interview conducted by the Commission.33\nNotably, the term “direct recruitment” is absent from any Pakistani law\nor regulation. However, Indian service jurisprudence** employs a parallel\nclassification comprising (i) direct recruitment, (ii) promotion, and (iii)\ntransfer, with direct recruitment statutorily defined identically to\nPakistan’s initial recruitment. This semantic and functional equivalence\nis reinforced by frequent interchangeable use of “direct recruitment” and\n“initial recruitment” in various Pakistani departmental manuals and\nservice documents.%° Hence, it is legally unsound to treat these terms as\n\ndistinct; they are interchangeable in both meaning and application.\n\n>?

No. 651/2025 12\n\nScope of Direct Recruitment: Fresh Entrants vs In-Service Applicants\n\n19. Initially, the Court was inclined to accept the learned\nAdditional Attorney General’s interpretation that “direct recruitment”\nsignifies only first entry into service. However, a deeper review of\ngovernment service structures reveals that in-service civil servants, with\na NOC from their parent department, may apply for vacancies designated\nfor “direct recruitment”. Thus, “direct recruitment” encompasses two\ncategories: (i) fresh entrants from outside the service, and (ii) in-service\ncandidates seeking appointment to new posts. Hence, the terms “initial\nrecruitment”/“direct recruitment” cannot be strictly confined to a fresh\ncandidate entering service for the first time as the same could equally\ninvolve an in-service candidate through an open competition.%® Therefore,\n“direct recruitment”/“initial recruitment” does not exclusively mean first\n\nentry into service.\n\nOne-Time Domicile Choice for Female Candidates: Purposive and Gender-\n\nSensitive Interpretation of Domicile in Direct Recruitment\n\n20. An exception to the general principle under O.M. 1971\nwhereby the domicile of a civil servat stands frozen upon entering the civil\nservice, has been carved out in the case of female officers who marry\nduring service. Recognizing the constitutional values of equality, dignity,\nand the realities of social mobility that accompany marital life, a limited\nconcession is provided whereby a woman officer may, only once, adopt\nthe domicile of her husband if she seeks appointment to a post through\ndirect recruitment. This exception acknowledges that marriage often\nentails a change in residence and social identity, and aims to\naccommodate such transitions without violating the broader principle of\ndomicile integrity. However, this option is strictly a one-time concession\nin the entire service tenure of the female officer. Once exercised, the new\ndomicile (based on husband’s domicile) stands frozen and remains\nimmutable regardless of whether the officer is subsequently divorced,\nwidowed, or remarries a person from another province. This safeguard\nensures that the exception does not evolve into an instrument of\ncircumvention or manipulation, and preserves the constitutional scheme\n\nof fair and equitable representation across the Federation.\n\nEstt.

The learned Additional Attorney General’s contention that\npermitting the respondent’s change of domicile would destabilize the civil\nservice structure would have been correct if the respondent remained in\nthe same service structure, however, the “direct recruitment” of in-service\ncandidates involves new pay scales, distinct terms, and a separate\nseniority list. Such recruitment neither alters existing service conditions\nnor infringes on vested rights. We are conscious of the fact that the\nrespondent would be accorded a benefit due to the change of her domicile\nas the advertised post was not for the KPK domicile holders, therefore her\nbatchmates holding the KPK domicile were deprived to take part in the\n“direct recruitment” process but as the respondent has changed the\ndomicile legally on the basis of her marriage and O.M. 1975 allows the\ndomicile of the husband to be considered for “direct recruitment”, no such\ndiscrimination exists as her case is distinguishable from that of her\ncolleagues in the same cadre. It is well settled law that statutory\nprovisions must be harmoniously interpreted, avoiding redundancy.37\nWhere two interpretations exist, one favouring the rights of civil servants\nand the other favouring the State, the one beneficial to the civil servants\nprevails.38 In interpreting the O.M. at hand, this Court has adopted a\nwomen-centric approach, consistent with Article 25(3) of the Constitution\nof Pakistan, which explicitly permits affirmative measures in favour of\nwomen. Such an interpretation advances substantive equality by\nrecognizing historical and structural disadvantages faced by women, and\nensures that the law is applied in a manner that promotes gender justice\nand inclusion. A purposive, gender-sensitive reading under Article 25(3),\n34 and 35 of the Constitution supports allowing female candidates,\nwhether fresh or in-service, a one-time, informed choice of domicile for\n“direct recruitment” under O.M. 1975. Once this choice is exercised the\ndomicile is once again frozen for the purposes of the civil service. Any\nsubsequent change in the marital status of a female civil servant (if any),\nwould have no bearing on the domicile and her domicile of choice is frozen\nfor the purpose of remaining service and for any posts arising out of\n“direct recruitment” in the future. Consequently, rejecting the\nrespondent’s matrimonial domicile was legally unsustainable. Applying\nthis to the instant case, given that the respondent has exercised the\noption to choose her domicile, this would be treated as a one-time choice\n\nonly in matters of direct rectuiment to a higher post during serivce.\n\n37 Wagar Zafar v.

No. 651/2025 14\n\nValidity of Experience Certificate, NOC, and Domicile Documentation\n\n22. The learned Additional Attorney General’s objection to the\nrespondent’s experience certificate on the ground that it was issued\nwithout a substantive appointment or promotion is without merit. While\nearlier certificates were issued by the Executive Director, PIMS, and the\nAdditional Secretary, MNHS, the competent authority under Section V(5),\n(6), and (9) of the PMDC Regulations is the Pakistan Medical and Dental\nCouncil (“PMDC”).39 The PMDC issued a certificate on 31.10.2023,\nconfirming that the respondent possesses 6 years, 4 months, and 29 days\nof teaching experience.4° This certification was issued after duly\nconsidering her performance of duties as a designated Assistant Professor\nunder an “internal arrangement”. It was argued that the term “internal\narrangement” does not connote that the respondent was posted as an\nAssistant Professor, hence her experience as such is not countable.\nHowever, in light of the certificates issued by PIMS, MNHS, and PMDC,\nthe term “internal arrangement” is at best an indoor policy of PIMS and\nhas no bearing on the rights of the respondent. No justifiable explanation\nhas been given by PIMS or MHNS regarding the term “internal\narrangement”. In this background, the PMDC certificate remains valid\nand unchallenged, and has achieved finality.41 Hence, the FPSC cannot\noverride or disregard the jurisdiction and findings of the duly designated\n\ncertifying authority.\n\n23. In view of the above reasons, and not for the reasons given in\nthe impugned judgment, this petition is hereby dismissed. Consequently,\nthe orders of the FPSC dated 02.10.2014 and 10.07.2024, whereby the\nrespondent’s candidature was rejected, are set aside. It is pointed out\nthat a seat of Associate Professor is still vacant.

            "CleanedText": "JUDGMENT Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, J.- Briefly, Dr. Shumaila Naeem the respondent then unmarried, joined government service as a Medical Officer on 07.09.2007!, based on her domicile of origin in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa KPK . Following her marriage on 31.05.2008 to a civil servant domiciled in Balochistan, she was transferred on deputation to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences PIMS under the Ministry of National Health Services Regulations and Coordination MNHS , in accordance with the wedlock policy, vide order dated 08.09.2009. She was subsequently absorbed at PIMS through a notification dated 17.12.2013, and was later promoted to the post of Senior Registrar BS18 on 14.12.2021 and also performed duties as Assistant Professor BS19 . It is prudent to note that the respondent did not change or alter her Letter No. F.1-260/2012-H-I dated 29.04.2025 issued by the Ministry of National Health Services Regulations and Coordination C.M.A. No. 3555/2025 . C.P.L.A. No. 651/2025 2 domicile throughout this time on the basis of her husband s domicile which is of Balochistan. Subsequently, during service, the respondent changed her domicile to that of her husband i.e, Province of Balochistan on 20.10.2018 and formally relinquished her Province of KPK domicile on 25.10.2018. On the basis of her new domicile, she applied for an advertised post of Associate Professor Obstetrics Gynaecology BS-19 at PIMS against the Balochistan seat. Controversy arose when the respondent, having obtained the requisite departmental no objection certificates NOCs for applying to the post of Assistant Professor Obstetrics Gynaecology BS-19 on the basis of her Balochistan domicile, got rejected by Federal Public Service Commission FPSC . Although the respondent successfully passed the written examination, her candidature was rejected by the FPSC vide memorandum dated 10.07.2024, on two grounds: first, that a change of domicile after entry into government service is impermissible; and second, that she lacked the requisite experience for the post. Dissatisfied with the FPSC s decision, the respondent preferred a departmental representation, which, along with her subsequent review petition, was dismissed through orders dated 12.09.2024 and 02.10.2024, respectively. However, her appeal under Section 7 3 d of the FPSC Ordinance, 1977 Ordinance before the Islamabad High Court was allowed vide judgment dated 28.01.2025 impugned judgment , whereby the impugned decisions rejecting her candidature were set aside. Aggrieved by the impugned judgment, the present petition for leave to appeal has been filed before this Court by the FPSC. 2. The learned Additional Attorney General, assisted by representatives of the FPSC and MNHS, contended that under the Establishment Division s Office Manual No. F.8/5/75-WC dated 12.08.1975 O.M. 1975 ?, a married female candidate may adopt her husband s domicile if applying for a post through direct recruitment . However, it was argued that direct recruitment refers solely to first-time entry into service, after which the domicile declared at initial induction under Establishment Division Office Manual No. 1/14/71-TRV dated 20.09.1971 O.M. 1971 becomes final and binding for the duration of service. The High Court, it was submitted, erred in holding that O.M. 1975 overrides O.M. 1971; instead, both operate in distinct spheres: O.M. 1975 governs initial appointments, while O.M. 1971 applies post-entry. Permitting a change of domicile mid-service, it was argued, could lead to ? An Office Manual in Pakistan s service law framework is a departmental guide for internal procedures. It does not override statutory service rules but can be used to interpret or implement them unless it contradicts a statute or constitutional provision. This is issued under Section 25 of the Civil Servants Act, 1973. C.P.L.A. No. 651/2025 3 arbitrary advantage and disruption of seniority. On the respondent s experience, it was submitted that the certificates were issued by unauthorized officials and reflected service on an internal arrangement, not a substantive appointment or promotion to BS-18. Hence, her experience was non-countable. Additionally, the NOC was challenged as legally infirm, allegedly obtained through misrepresentation of domicile. Accordingly, the FPSC s rejection of both her Balochistan domicile and experience was defended as lawful. 3. Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent raised several objections to the FPSC s actions. As a preliminary matter, he contended that the FPSC lacks locus standi to file the petition and cannot be represented by the State, relying on this Court s settled jurisprudence. On merits, it was argued that the respondent, having secured the highest marks in the written examination, acquired a vested right to be fairly considered for appointment, one that could not be arbitrarily denied. He further submitted that the respondent does not fall within the definition of a civil servant under the Occupational Groups and Services Probation, Training and Seniority Rules, 1990, making O.M. 1971 inapplicable. Since the post was to be filled through direct recruitment , her husband s domicile recognized under O.M. 1975 ought to be considered. Direct recruitment , it was emphasized, entails fresh appointments distinct from existing service, seniority, or promotion structures, involving independent pay scales and selection procedures. The respondent was said to have met all experiential requirements, supported by a valid experience certificate issued under the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council Regulations, 2018 PMDC Regulations . As this certificate had not been challenged through any legal forum, it had attained finality. Reference was also made to Rule 14 of the Civil Servants Appointment, Promotion and Transfer Rules, 1973, which allocates only six percent of seats for Balochistan. It was argued that had the respondent retained her KPK domicile, her selection prospects would have been stronger, undermining allegations of strategic domicile change. Accordingly, the FPSC s rejection of her domicile and experience was characterized as arbitrary, erroneous, and without legal basis. 4. The learned amicus curiae opined that Sections 15 and 16 of the Succession Act, 1925 1925 Act are inapplicable to the present matter, as their provisions do not extend to Muslims. She further submitted that the respondent may avail the benefit of O.M. 1975 only if this Court concludes on the factual plane that the advertised post constitutes a new post and falls within the scope of direct recruitment . C.P.L.A. No. 651/2025 4 5. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and amicus curiae at length and have carefully examined the impugned judgment, the applicable law, and the record of the case. Preliminary Objections: Locus Standi, Representation and Status of the Respondent 6. Before addressing the substantive issues, we must first dispose of the preliminary objections raised by the respondent. Firstly, he contended that the FPSC lacks locus standi to file the petition relying on Rahim Foods . We have examined the said judgement whereby this Court categorically held that the Competition Commission of Pakistan CCP , under the Competition Act, 2010 2010 Act , functions primarily as a regulatory body and also as a quasi-judicial forum. However, when CCP decides a matter between rival parties in exercise of its quasi-judicial powers, CCP cannot claim to be an aggrieved person for the purposes of challenging a decision before a superior forum. No such quasiadjudicatory framework exists under the Ordinance in question , which merely provides for an administrative review of the FPSC s own decisions. Therefore, the instant case is distinguishable. The impugned rejection of the respondent s candidature is not a determination made in a quasijudicial capacity of FPSC between contesting parties but rather exercising an administrative power of review of its earlier order. Therefore, the precedent cited by the respondent is inapposite, as it pertains to quasijudicial bodies seeking to defend their adjudicatory decisions, which is not the situation here. The objection to the locus standi of the FPSC to file the present appeal is misconceived. 7. The second objection challenging the competence of the learned Additional Attorney General to represent the FPSC is equally untenable. As an attached department of the Establishment Division , the FPSC is a Federal Government entity and, as a matter of settled law, must be represented by government counsel, not private advocates. The respondent s claim of a vested right to appointment on the basis of her performance in the written test is similarly flawed. The FPSC retains the authority to determine eligibility, and mere success in the examination or a conditional recommendation does not confer a vested right to 3 A. Rahim Foods Pvt. v. K N s Foods Pvt. PLD 2023 SC 516. 4 Wafaqi Mohtasib v. SNGPL PLD 2020 SC 586. 5 Section 7 of the Ordinance. Rule 4 4 read with Schedule III of The Rules of Business 1973 and Dr. Riffat Kamal v.

No. 651/2025 5 appointment. Further, the argument that the respondent is not a civil servant lacks merit. It is settled by this Court that a civil servant is someone who holds a civil post in connection with the affairs of the Federation and who has been employed by the competent authority i.e., either by the FPSC or the Provincial Public Service Commission in the prescribed manner after following the due process of law and having gone through the process of competition.? Applying this to the instant case, the respondent was appointed through the KPK Public Service Commission i.e., competent authority through an open competition, Moreover, this Court has already held that doctors employed in PIMS and other federal institutions hold civil posts and are civil servants within the meaning of Section 2 1 b of the Civil Servants Act, 1973.19 Accordingly, the respondent s reliance on the inapplicability of O.M. 1971 is misplaced and does not withstand scrutiny. The Legal Doctrine of Domicile: Origins, Elements, and Contemporary Relevance 8. Before turning to the core controversy surrounding domicile and its bearing on direct recruitment , it is instructive to examine the legal doctrine of domicile itself. Modern scholarship traces its origins to Roman law, with English Canon Law serving as the vehicle for its transmission into the common law tradition.!! The term domicile is derived from the Latin domicilium from domum colere - to inhabit or cultivate a home , and its Dutch counterpart woonplaats, both evoking the notion of a permanent legal home this is where you are, because this is where you belong. !2 Across jurisdictions, legal dictionaries and judicial pronouncements consistently define domicile as a person s legal home to which they intend to return whenever absent.! Lord Chelmsford aptly 8 Paragraph 14 b of General Instructions of Federal Public Service Commission states that Eligibility of the candidates in terms of Recruitment Rules and the advertised conditions shall be determined after the conduct of screening/professional test/descriptive examination. On detailed scrutiny of the applications if they are found ineligible, their candidatures will be cancelled irrespective of the fact whether they have appeared in the examination/test or even qualified therein.

See Article 240 of the Constitution and Section 2 1 b , Civil Servants Act, 1973 which defines civil servants as means a person who is a member of an All-Pakistan Service or of a civil service of the Federation, or who holds a civil post in connection with the affairs of the Federation, including any such post connected with defence, but does not include i a person who is on deputation to the Federation from any Province or other authority; ii a person who is employed on contract, or on work-charged basis or who is paid from contingencies; or ili a person who is a worker or workman as defined in the Factories Act, 1934 XXV of 1934 , or the Workmen s Compensation Act, 1923. !

No. 651/2025 6 described it as the intention of a permanent home. ! Thus, domicile has two essential components: i factum - the physical fact of residence; and ii animus manendi - the intention of remaining there permanently.!5 Importantly, domicile is not synonymous with residence. While one may have multiple residences, a person can have only one domicile at a time. Indeed, even a person with no physical home cannot be without a domicile in law. Domicile may be categorized as: i Domicile of origin: acquired by operation of law at birth; ii Domicile of choice: adopted voluntarily by a legally competent person intending to make a place their permanent home; and iii Domicile of dependence: determined by the domicile of another, such as a spouse, parent, or legal guardian.! It is a settled principle that any person, subject to legal capacity and in accordance with applicable law, may lawfully change their domicile. 9. Domicile, though often perceived as administrative, is a foundational legal concept that shapes an individual s access to rights, opportunities, and entitlements. It is not merely a declaration of permanent residence, but a legal construct that governs access to public services, education, employment, political participation, and regional entitlements. Domicile can influence taxation, voting rights, and eligibility for regional quotas in civil service recruitment.! In Lord Westbury s words, domicile is a relation which the law creates between an individual and a particular locality or country. !8 Theories of domicile span several disciplines law, human geography, and residential mobility, each highlighting how one s place of habitual residence affects jurisdiction, migration patterns, and settlement dynamics. Accordingly, domicile must always be interpreted in light of the underlying purpose it is meant to serve. 10. In Pakistan, the concept of domicile is recognized in Part II of the 1925 Act, Section 17 of the Citizenship Act, 1951 1951 Act , and the Schedule to Rule 310-A of the Civil Service Regulations CSR Volume I. These provisions acknowledge changes of domicile through dependence, voluntary relocation, choice, or marriage. The procedural framework for obtaining, modifying, renewing, or cancelling domicile is outlined in the Citizenship Rules, 1952.19 This legal understanding of 4 Waicker v Hume 1858 10 HLC 124.

No. 651/2025 7 domicile is central to the present controversy, as the respondent claims eligibility for appointment under the province of Balochistan quota on the basis of a changed domicile acquired through marriage. Whether such a change is legally sustainable, for a civil servant, for the purpose of direct recruitment , particularly after entry into civil service, lies at the heart of the dispute now before this Court. Applicability of Sections 15 and 16 of the Succession Act, 1925 on Muslims 11. The respondent argued that, by virtue of Sections 15 and 16 of the 1925 Act that a wife s domicile automatically shifts to that of her husband upon marriage. However, this contention is legally untenable. These provisions fall under Part II of the 1925 Act, which, by virtue of Section 4, expressly excludes their application to Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, and Jainas. The historical context reinforces this exclusion. Prior to the Succession Act, 1865, Muslims and Hindus were governed by their respective personal laws, while other communities were subject to a patchwork of colonial legal principles. The 1925 Act was a consolidating statute aimed at non-Muslim and non-Hindu communities, deliberately preserving the autonomy of personal laws in succession matters for the latter.2 Accordingly, Sections 15 and 16 have no applicability to Muslims, and the respondent s reliance on them is misplaced. 12. For civil servants, the applicable domicile regime is set out in the Schedule to Rule 310-A of the CSR, Volume I. This Schedule explicitly recognizes the change of domicile through marriage and other modes, and affirms that the domicile of a married woman ordinarily follows that of her husband. As the respondent is a civil servant, it is this framework not the 1925 Act or 1951 Act that governs the determination and change of her domicile. Domicile and Marriage: Autonomy, Dependency, and the Rights of Women in Civil Service 13. While CSR recognizes that a married woman may adopt her husband s domicile by virtue of Item No. 7 of the Schedule to Rule 310-A of the CSR. Having established that the respondent s status as a civil servant brings her within the ambit of Rule 310-A, the critical question that arises is whether such adoption is automatic or mandatory; or a matter of personal choice under the Item No. 7 of the Schedule and; ?0 Law Commission of India, Report No 247 on Indian Succession Act Government of India 2014 . C.P.L.A. No. 651/2025 8 whether the domicile of civil servant freezes upon entry into the civil service and cannot be altered during service. i Acquisition of the domicile of the husband is optional 14. To address the first question, it is necessary to examine whether the mere fact of marriage results in a compulsory shift of domicile. There exist interpretational inconsistencies among courts regarding whether a wife s acquisition of her husband s domicile is a matter of law or choice.?! The traditional common law rule under which a wife s domicile followed that of her husband is rooted in the doctrine of dependency and aimed at preserving legal unity within the marital relationship. However, this dependency rule has come under strong criticism for subordinating a woman s agency. Lord Denning famously described it as the last barbarous relic of a wife s servitude, calling for its abandonment in light of modern principles of equality and autonomy. This rule, born from the doctrine of coverture22 which rendered a married woman civilly dead by merging her legal identity into that of her husband has been widely rejected across common law jurisdictions.? Legal reforms in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, and Singapore have abolished the automatic domicile rule, affirming a woman s right to independently determine her legal affiliation.24 Even in jurisdictions like Malaysia, where no statute has been enacted, courts have recognized a woman s right to abandon her husband s domicile and assert her own.25 From a constitutional standpoint, tethering a woman s legal identity and civic entitlements to her husband s domicile infringes upon her autonomy, dignity, and equality. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women CEDAW , to which Pakistan is a signatory? , affirms a woman s right to be free from such marital subordination and to choose her domicile irrespective of her marital status.2 Accordingly, the proposition that a woman s domicile automatically changes upon marriage is neither supported by contemporary constitutional values nor binding in the absence of express 2!

C.P.L.A. No. 651/2025 9 legal compulsion. It is therefore held that a married woman retains the legal discretion, choice or agency to either adopt her husband s domicile or retain her own. In the present case, the respondent, by her own volition, opted to adopt her husband s domicile, which is legally permissible. ii The domicile freezes on joining the civil service and cannot be changed during service in light of O.M. 1971 15. Unlike general domicile concepts rooted in personal identity and legal affiliation, the interpretation of domicile for government servants must be aligned with the objectives and practical necessities of recruitment policies and service conditions. Domicile must be understood in light of the purpose and object of the relevant legal context. In service law, it is interpreted with reference to recruitment policies and service terms.28 The Establishment Division s O.M. 1971 addresses the issue of domicile change after entry into government service: Change of Domicile after entry into Government Service: A question has arisen whether a government servant who entered service based on the domicile of a particular province/region may subsequently change domicile during service. While a government servant, as a Pakistani citizen, may change domicile under law, it has been decided that the domicile declared and accepted at entry shall be final for the duration of service and no later change shall be recognized for service terms, including postings and transfers. emphasis supplied The O.M. 1971 permits civil servants irrespective of gender to change their domicile for purposes related to citizenship rights and obligations. However, the domicile declared and accepted at entry into civil service shall be final for the duration of service and no later change shall be recognized for service terms, including postings and transfers.29 This principle equally applies to female civil servants. The rationale behind this is that Pakistan, as a constitutional Federation, comprises several Provinces with distinct socio-economic profiles and varying levels of development. To ensure equitable representation and fair opportunities across the Federation, the civil service recruitment process allocates vacancies based on provincial quotas determined by the domicile of the candidates. Domicile, in this context, serves as a constitutional tool to promote inclusivity and national integration by safeguarding the interests of less-developed regions and underrepresented populations. Once a candidate enters the civil service against a post allocated to a particular province or region, their domicile is considered frozen to maintain the 28 Mauzam Hanif v. Settlement Officer 2006 SCMR 642. ?9 Qaisar Khan v. Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 2021 SCMR 67 and Muhammad Shakoor and Rehan Safdar v. Federal Public Service Commission PLD 2007 SC 381. C.P.L.A. No. 651/2025 10 integrity of this federal balancing mechanism. It is also important to note that permitting the change of domicile may affect the mechanism of transfer and seniority as well. Disregarding seniority undermines bureaucratic impartiality, violates constitutional guarantees of due process and equality Article 4 and 25 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 Constitution and breeds cynicism within the service. The erosion of seniority norms weakens administrative stability.3! Allowing post-induction changes in domicile would not only undermine the quota system but also open avenues for manipulation, enabling individuals to shift provincial affiliation for personal advantage, thereby diluting the constitutional promise of provincial parity. The freezing of domicile thus serves the larger constitutional purpose of federal harmony and administrative fairness within the civil service structure of Pakistan. 16. In this context, an unmarried female civil servant such as the respondent while legally entitled to adopt the domicile of her husband upon marriage, but for all service-related entitlements and obligations, her original domicile in this case, KPK continues to be the determining document. The question that now arises is whether the O.M. 1975 creates a specific exception that permits a female civil servant to change her domicile or use her husband s domicile under the aforesaid O.M. during service, only in limited cases where appointment to a higher post is through direct recruitment ? Direct Recruitment of in-service female candidates is an exception to general rule 17. Learned counsel for the respondent relied on O.M. 1975, arguing that because the advertised post was to be filled by direct recruitment , the respondent s matrimonial domicile cannot be disregarded. O.M. 1975 states: Married Female Candidates - Determination of Domicile: According to Estt. Division s O.M. No. 2/2/67 dated August 26, 1968, a candidate s domicile is determined by their parents domicile or, if the parents of a migrant candidate have not migrated to Pakistan, by the candidate s own residence and education in the province of domicile. The question whether a married female candidate can be deemed to share her husband s domicile has been considered, and it was decided that for direct recruitment, a married female candidate s domicile may be accepted as that of her husband. emphasis supplied 3 Hadayat Ullah v.

Barbara Geddes, Politician s Dilemma: Building State Capacity in Latin America University of California Press 1994 and Paul P Craig and Adam Tomkins eds , The Executive and Public Law: Power and Accountability in Comparative Perspective Oxford University Press 2006 . C.P.L.A. No. 651/2025 11 The above shows that a married candidate not yet in service may opt for either her own or her husband s domicile, and once chosen, that domicile is final for service terms. However, to assess O.M. 1975 s applicability to a civil servant already in service, three objections raised by the learned Additional Attorney General must be addressed: i the advertised post was for initial recruitment not direct recruitment; ii direct recruitment implies first entry into service; and iii allowing an in-service female civil servant to change domicile risks disrupting seniority and service structure. Direct Recruitment and Initial Recruitment are interchangeable terms 18. Having clarified the distinct applicability of O.M. 1975 to female civil servants, it is essential to address the terminology surrounding recruitment, particularly the distinction or lack thereof between direct recruitment and initial recruitment, which forms a critical basis for the arguments advanced. Service rules in Pakistan recognize three modes of appointment ?: i initial recruitment, ii promotion, and iii transfer. Initial recruitment is defined as an appointment made otherwise than by promotion or transfer, typically through examination, test, or interview conducted by the Commission.33 Notably, the term direct recruitment is absent from any Pakistani law or regulation. However, Indian service jurisprudence employs a parallel classification comprising i direct recruitment, ii promotion, and iii transfer, with direct recruitment statutorily defined identically to Pakistan s initial recruitment. This semantic and functional equivalence is reinforced by frequent interchangeable use of direct recruitment and initial recruitment in various Pakistani departmental manuals and service documents. Hence, it is legally unsound to treat these terms as distinct; they are interchangeable in both meaning and application. ?

No. 651/2025 12 Scope of Direct Recruitment: Fresh Entrants vs In-Service Applicants 19. Initially, the Court was inclined to accept the learned Additional Attorney General s interpretation that direct recruitment signifies only first entry into service. However, a deeper review of government service structures reveals that in-service civil servants, with a NOC from their parent department, may apply for vacancies designated for direct recruitment . Thus, direct recruitment encompasses two categories: i fresh entrants from outside the service, and ii in-service candidates seeking appointment to new posts. Hence, the terms initial recruitment / direct recruitment cannot be strictly confined to a fresh candidate entering service for the first time as the same could equally involve an in-service candidate through an open competition. Therefore, direct recruitment / initial recruitment does not exclusively mean first entry into service. One-Time Domicile Choice for Female Candidates: Purposive and GenderSensitive Interpretation of Domicile in Direct Recruitment 20. An exception to the general principle under O.M. 1971 whereby the domicile of a civil servat stands frozen upon entering the civil service, has been carved out in the case of female officers who marry during service. Recognizing the constitutional values of equality, dignity, and the realities of social mobility that accompany marital life, a limited concession is provided whereby a woman officer may, only once, adopt the domicile of her husband if she seeks appointment to a post through direct recruitment. This exception acknowledges that marriage often entails a change in residence and social identity, and aims to accommodate such transitions without violating the broader principle of domicile integrity. However, this option is strictly a one-time concession in the entire service tenure of the female officer. Once exercised, the new domicile based on husband s domicile stands frozen and remains immutable regardless of whether the officer is subsequently divorced, widowed, or remarries a person from another province. This safeguard ensures that the exception does not evolve into an instrument of circumvention or manipulation, and preserves the constitutional scheme of fair and equitable representation across the Federation.

The learned Additional Attorney General s contention that permitting the respondent s change of domicile would destabilize the civil service structure would have been correct if the respondent remained in the same service structure, however, the direct recruitment of in-service candidates involves new pay scales, distinct terms, and a separate seniority list. Such recruitment neither alters existing service conditions nor infringes on vested rights. We are conscious of the fact that the respondent would be accorded a benefit due to the change of her domicile as the advertised post was not for the KPK domicile holders, therefore her batchmates holding the KPK domicile were deprived to take part in the direct recruitment process but as the respondent has changed the domicile legally on the basis of her marriage and O.M. 1975 allows the domicile of the husband to be considered for direct recruitment , no such discrimination exists as her case is distinguishable from that of her colleagues in the same cadre. It is well settled law that statutory provisions must be harmoniously interpreted, avoiding redundancy.37 Where two interpretations exist, one favouring the rights of civil servants and the other favouring the State, the one beneficial to the civil servants prevails.38 In interpreting the O.M. at hand, this Court has adopted a women-centric approach, consistent with Article 25 3 of the Constitution of Pakistan, which explicitly permits affirmative measures in favour of women. Such an interpretation advances substantive equality by recognizing historical and structural disadvantages faced by women, and ensures that the law is applied in a manner that promotes gender justice and inclusion. A purposive, gender-sensitive reading under Article 25 3 , 34 and 35 of the Constitution supports allowing female candidates, whether fresh or in-service, a one-time, informed choice of domicile for direct recruitment under O.M. 1975. Once this choice is exercised the domicile is once again frozen for the purposes of the civil service. Any subsequent change in the marital status of a female civil servant if any , would have no bearing on the domicile and her domicile of choice is frozen for the purpose of remaining service and for any posts arising out of direct recruitment in the future. Consequently, rejecting the respondent s matrimonial domicile was legally unsustainable. Applying this to the instant case, given that the respondent has exercised the option to choose her domicile, this would be treated as a one-time choice only in matters of direct rectuiment to a higher post during serivce. 37 Wagar Zafar v. Haji Mazhar Hussain Shah PLD 2018 SC 81 and Aftab Shahban Mirani v. Muhammad Ibrahim PLD 2008 SC 779. 38 Mohsin Ali Hasani v. Government of Pakistan 1990 SCMR 1685. C.P.L.A. No. 651/2025 14 Validity of Experience Certificate, NOC, and Domicile Documentation 22. The learned Additional Attorney General s objection to the respondent s experience certificate on the ground that it was issued without a substantive appointment or promotion is without merit. While earlier certificates were issued by the Executive Director, PIMS, and the Additional Secretary, MNHS, the competent authority under Section V 5 , 6 , and 9 of the PMDC Regulations is the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council PMDC .39 The PMDC issued a certificate on 31.10.2023, confirming that the respondent possesses 6 years, 4 months, and 29 days of teaching experience.4 This certification was issued after duly considering her performance of duties as a designated Assistant Professor under an internal arrangement . It was argued that the term internal arrangement does not connote that the respondent was posted as an Assistant Professor, hence her experience as such is not countable. However, in light of the certificates issued by PIMS, MNHS, and PMDC, the term internal arrangement is at best an indoor policy of PIMS and has no bearing on the rights of the respondent. No justifiable explanation has been given by PIMS or MHNS regarding the term internal arrangement . In this background, the PMDC certificate remains valid and unchallenged, and has achieved finality.41 Hence, the FPSC cannot override or disregard the jurisdiction and findings of the duly designated certifying authority. 23. In view of the above reasons, and not for the reasons given in the impugned judgment, this petition is hereby dismissed. Consequently, the orders of the FPSC dated 02.10.2014 and 10.07.2024, whereby the respondent s candidature was rejected, are set aside. It is pointed out that a seat of Associate Professor is still vacant. The petitioner is, therefore, directed to consider the case of the respondent for appointment for the post of Associate Professor on her Balochistan domicile strictly in accordance with law and after complying with all codal formalities within a fortnight of the receipt of this judgment.

It is the ultimate guardian of fundamental rights and the final sentinel against executive or legislative overreach. Judges of this Court are not passive interpreters of text, they are the custodians of liberty, equality, and institutional independence. The Court must remain alive to the evolving aspirations of society and innovate new remedies to advance justice. 25. Judges are to act with integrity and courage, to resist all encroachments, external or internal that threaten to erode the autonomy of the judiciary or subvert the rule of law. Judges must not fall prey to the lure of small, short-term benefits, whether of elevation, power, or personal comfort that may accrue if they speak the language of authority rather than that of the Constitution. Such benefits are illusory and transient. The true reward of a judge lies in preserving the dignity of the institution and the trust of the people. It is also the solemn duty of judges of this Court to call out, with moral clarity and institutional courage, those among their ranks who surrender to the power of the day at the cost of constitutional principles. Critique from within, when rooted in fidelity to the Constitution, is not disloyalty, it is the highest form of service to the judicial institution. History is a vigilant witness. It does not remember those who accommodated power, but those who stood resolute in defense of principle. The jurisprudential legacy of a judge is not built on appeasement but on principled defiance when the soul of justice is imperiled. Courts must never become tools of expediency. Rather, they must be lighthouses of constitutional morality and guardians of democratic integrity. History will not absolve judges who abandon their constitutional duty; it will remember them not as dispensers of justice, but as collaborators in injustice. 26.

He did not deny execution of Nikah Nama or the relationship\nof husband and wife between the parties, however, he took the plea\nthat the dower claimed by the petitioner/ plaintiff has already been\npaid, without producing any proof of such plea. On the pleadings of\n\nCivil Petition No. 252'P of 2925\n2s\nthe parties, the trial Court framed the following issues and directed the\n\nparties to produce their evidence:-\n\n1.

The petitioner has challenged the\nimpugned order dated 12.02.2025 passed by the Division Bench of\nPeshawar High Court, Peshawar in Custom Reference Application No.\n154-P/2024, whereby the reference filed under Section 196 of the\nCustoms Act 1969, (hereinafter referred to as the “Act”) against the\njudgment dated 04.11.2024 passed by the Custom Appellate Tribunal,\n\nPeshawar (Special Division Bench), was dismissed.\n\n2. Brief facts of the case as recorded by the Division Bench\nof Peshawar High Court in the impugned order while deciding the\naforesaid reference application are that “the staff of the Field\nIntelligence Unit, Mardan intercepted a Toyota Corolla Motorcar\nbearing Registration No. BA-1812/Peshawar (hereinafter referred to\nas the “subject vehicle”) at Charsadda Road, Peshawar. On demand,\nthe driver Muhammad Jamil son of Damsaz produced a GD No.\nKAPR-HC-137314 dated 06.04.2006 showing the import of a used\nToyota Corolla Car Model 2003 chassis No. NZE120-3027717. The\n\nCivil Petition No. 288-P/2025 2\n\nvehicle was brought to the office of Intelligence and Investigation\nCustoms Peshawar and was detained in terms of section 17 of the Act.\nAccordingly, a letter dated 30.10.2022 was sent to Junior User\nSupport Officer, Intelligence & Investigation (PRAL), Hayatabad,\nPeshawar to verify the import status of the vehicle and in response, it\nwas reported vide letter dated 02.01.2022 that the record of the\nvehicle pertaining to chassis No. NZE120-3027717 could not be\ntraced in one customs database. Further, the Director FSL, Peshawar\nwas also requested vide letter dated 02.11.2022 to chemically\nexamine the chassis number of the vehicle and through letter dated\n08.11.2022, the Director FSL submitted his report, according to\nwhich, no other number has been deciphered in its chassis number.\nAs there was reason to believe that the foreign-origin Toyota Corolla\nMotorcar was a non-duty paid/smuggled one and was brought into\nthe country through unauthorized routes without payment of leviable\nduty/taxes; therefore, the vehicle was seized on 10.11.2022 in terms\nof section 168(1) of the Act for violation of section 2(s) and 16 of the\nAct read with section 3(1) of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act,\n1950 and SRO 566(1)/2005 dated 06.06.2005 punishable under\nsection 156(1) clause (8) and (89) of the Act read with section 3(3) of\nthe Imports and Exports (Control) Act, 1950 and SRO 499(1)/2009\ndated 13.06.2009. After completion of requisite formalities, the matter\nwas placed before the Collector of Customs (Adjudication), Islamabad,\nwho vie order-in-original 39/2023 dated 08.02.2023 ordered for\noutright confiscation of the vehicle. The respondents feeling aggrieved\nfiled an appeal bearing No. Cus-160/PB/2023 before the worthy\nTribunal. The Worthy Tribunal allowed the appeal and released the\nvehicle to the owner unconditionally vide impugned judgment dated\n04.11.2024”.\n\n3. The Division Bench of the Peshawar High Court after\nhearing the learned counsel for the petitioner and scrutiny of entire\nrecord while referring to the relevant provisions of the Customs Act,\n1969 as well as the provisions of West Pakistan Motor Vehicles\nOrdinance, 1965 was pleased to dismiss the reference application by\nholding that the seizure of the subject vehicle by the Custom\nAuthorities on the allegations of its being smuggled vehicle was\nunlawful. It has been further held that in view of the fact that the\nsubject vehicle was duly registered under Section 25 of the West\n\nPakistan Motor Vehicles Ordinance, 1965, the presumption of truth\n\nCivil Petition No. 288-P/2025 3\n\nwas attached to the official document of registration hence, the\nburden under Section 187 of the Act was shifted from the owner of\nsubject vehicle upon the Custom Authorities to establish that subject\nvehicle was unlawfully imported. While reaching to such conclusion\nthe Division Bench of Peshawar High Court, Peshawar has further\nheld that since the subject vehicle was more than 5 years old at the\ntime of its confiscation by the Custom Authorities, therefore, in view\nof Section 211 of the Act the owner of the subject vehicle was not\nunder legal obligation to keep the record of such import beyond the\nperiod of 5 years. Accordingly, the reference filed by the Custom\nAuthorities before the Peshawar High Court was dismissed and the\n\norder passed by the Custom Appellate Tribunal was upheld.\n\n4. The learned counsel for the petitioner while referring to\nthe questions proposed in the instant civil petition for leave to appeal\nvehemently argued that the controversy involved in the instant case\nrelates to the authority of the officials of Directorate of Intelligence,\nCustoms, to intercept any imported vehicle while plying on road for\nthe purposes of verification of its lawful import, payment of duty and\ntaxes etc. Whereas, the burden to prove that such vehicle is lawfully\nimported is upon the importer/owner of said vehicle in terms of\nSection 187 of the Act and in case the importer/owner of subject\nvehicle fails to discharge the burden, than the said vehicle can be\nseized in terms of section 168(1) of the Act for violation of section 2(s)\nand 16 of the Act read with section 3(1) of the Imports and Exports\n(Control) Act, 1950 and SRO 566(1)/2005 dated 06.06.2005\npunishable under section 156(1) clause (8) and (89) of the Act read\nwith section 3(3) of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, 1950 and\nSRO 499(1)/2009 dated 13.06.2009. According to the learned counsel\nfor the petitioner the Customs Appellate Tribunal and the Hon’ble\nDivision Bench of Peshawar High Court, Peshawar have erred in law\nand facts while holding that the burden of proof regarding the lawful\nimport of subject vehicle was lawfully discharged by the\nimporter/owner of subject vehicle in view of Registration of the\nsubject vehicle under Section 25 of the West Pakistan Motor\nRegistration Authority which fact alone is sufficient to discharge such\nburden in terms of Section 187 of the Act. It has been prayed that the\nimpugned order may be set aside and instant civil petition for leave to\n\nappeal may be allowed.\n\n5. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, perused the\n\nCivil Petition No. 288-P/2025 4\n\nrecord and the impugned order passed by the Division Bench of\nPeshawar High Court, Peshawar in the above aforesaid reference\n\napplication with his assistance.\n\n6. Since the facts as recorded by the Division Bench of\nPeshawar High Court are not disputed by the learned counsel for the\npetitioner, therefore, we need not further elaborate the factual\nposition and would decide the legal issues involved in the instant\ncase, including seizure of an imported vehicle duly registered in\nPakistan by the Motor Vehicle Registration Authority by the Custom\nAuthorities, while plying on the road within the city limits, by\ninvoking the provisions of Section 168(1) of the Act requiring the\nowner to show the import documents and in case of failure by the\nowner of such import documents, to seize the same on the\n\npresumption that such vehicle is a smuggled vehicle.\n\nth It is pertinent to note that the questions as proposed in\nthe instant civil petition for leave to appeal as decided by the Custom\nAppellate Tribunal and the Division Bench of Peshawar High Court,\nPeshawar in aforesaid reference application have already been dealt\nwith in detail by the Division Bench of High Court of Sindh in the case\nof the Additional Director, Directorate General of Intelligence and\nInvestigation-FBR, Regional Office, Karachi and another v. Imran Khan\nand another (2021 PTD 1683) in Special Custom Reference\nApplication No. 110/2014 alongwith others. It will be advantageous to\nreproduce the proposed questions of law which have been decided by\nthe Division Bench of High Court of Sindh in the aforesaid cited case\n\nwhich read as follows:\n\n\"1. Whether banned goods (Notified vide Serial No. 26 of SRO\n566(I)/2005 dated 06.06.2005, issued for the purpose of\nSections 2(s) and 156(2) of the Customs Act, 1969, could be\nreleased by the learned Customs Appellate Tribunal without\nany discussion much less examination and analysis of the\nfacts and law involved?\n\n2. Whether the learned Member (Technical), Appellate\nTribunal, Bench-II, Karachi, has seriously erred in law by not\ntaking notice and giving findings on the evidence of Chemical\nExamination Report No.AIG/FD/OR/274/2012 dated\n06.11.2012, confirming therein tampering of the chassis\nframe?\n\n3. Whether the learned Member (Technical), Appellate\nTribunal, Bench-II, Karachi, while concluding the impugned\njudgment has seriously erred in law and failed to\nunderstand that in terms of subsection (2) of Section 156 and\nSection 187 of the Customs Act, 1969, the\nrespondent/ possession holder of the vehicle has failed to\n\nCivil Petition No. 288-P/2025 5\n\n8.\n\ndischarge burden of proof of lawful possession?\n\n4, Whether registration of smuggled vehicle, having tampered\nchassis number with Motor Registration Authority Civic\nCentre, Karachi can regularize a smuggled vehicle and\nabsolve it from penal action under the Customs Act, 1969?\n\n5. Whether \"importation\" and registration, in context of\nvehicles, are not different and distinct concepts, the former\nbeing under the Customs Act, 1969 and the latter being the\nProvincial subject and whether mere registration of vehicle\nabsolves the owner/ possessor of a vehicle to prove its legal\nimportation under the Customs Act, 1969?\n\nHowever, above proposed questions were reframed in the\n\nfollowing terms:\n\n9.\n\n(i) Whether a motor vehicle, duly registered with the Excise\nand Taxation Department under the Motor Vehicle\nRegistration Ordinance, 1965, can be detained/seized by the\nCustoms Authorities on the charges of smuggling in terms of\nSection 2(S) read with Section 156(1)(89) and (90) of the\nCustoms Act, 1969, if the owner is not in possession of the\nimport documents?\n\n(ii) Whether the Customs Authorities can ask for production of\nrecord including import documents from owner in respect of a\nMotor Vehicle or any other importable item, beyond the period\nof five years in terms of Section 211 of the Customs Act,\n1969?\n\n(iii) Whether the Registration Book, Customs Auction\nDocuments, Form of Transfer Order, Bank challans towards\npayments of additional duty and taxes, capital value tax\n(CVT), registration fee transfer fee and other charges, unless\nproved to be bogus and forged, constitute other documents\nprescribed by or under any law for the time being in force in\nterms of Section 187 of the Customs Act, 1969?\n\n(iv) Whether production of documents as prescribed by or\nunder any law for the time being in force by the owner in\nrespect of a motor vehicle or any other importable item shifts\nthe burden of proof from the owner, upon the Customs\nAuthorities to establish the charge of smuggling through\npositive evidence or any concrete material to the contrary, in\nterms of Section 2(s) read with Section 156(1)(89) and (90) of\nCustoms Act, 1969?\n\nPerusal of hereinabove questions shows that the\n\ncontroversy involved in the above mentioned case is identical to\n\nquestions involved in the instant case, therefore, the decision on the\naforesaid questions has a direct bearing on the legal issues involved in\n\nthe instant case, hence the relevant findings on the said issues are\n\nreproduced as under:\n\n“7. We have reproduced the relevant facts, questions\nproposed and the findings recorded thereon by the\nDivisional Bench of this Court in the aforesaid reference\napplication at length, as we are of the view that the facts\nand legal issues involved in all these cases are similar to\nthe facts and legal issues of the above cited case, and,\n\nCivil Petition No. 288-P/2025 6\n\ntherefore, would be relevant to decide the questions of law\nand legal points involved in these reference applications\nand the connected petitions as well as High Court Appeal.\nAs we have already observed that in none of these cases,\nthere is any allegation against the owners/subsequent\npurchases for having committed an act of smuggling in\nterms of Section 2(s) of the Customs Act, 1969, as neither\nthey have imported subject vehicles nor they have brought\nsuch vehicles into Pakistan from routes other than\nspecified under Section 9 or 10 from any place other than\na Customs Station, nor any evidence or material has been\nproduced by the Customs Authorities, which could\notherwise establish that documents produced, e.g.\nRegistration Books issued by Excise and Taxation\nDepartment, Motor Vehicle Registration Authority,\nGovernment of Sindh, Form of Transfer Order, the\nsale/purchase agreements, the Custom Auction\ndocuments, Bank Challans towards payment of Additional\nCustoms duty and taxes, CVT, registration fee, transfer\nfee and other charges etc., produced in respect of subject\nvehicles, are forged or bogus documents. Admittedly, all\nthe owners of the subject vehicles in these cases are\nsecond, third or even fifth owners, and have supplied the\nabove documents which, prima-facie, show that initial\nburden of proof to the effect that they are the bona fide\nlawful owners/purchasers of the subject vehicles and\nhave not committed any act of smuggling nor they are in\npossession of smuggled vehicles. The subject vehicles do\nnot fall within the category of banned items as defined in\nAppendix-A of the Import Policy Order, 2009, 2012, and\n2016, however, their import is subject to certain conditions\nprescribed by the Federal Government through\nNotifications issued in terms of Section 2(s)(ti) read with\nsection 156(2) of the Customs Act, 1969, Import Policy\nOrders, 2009, 2012, 2013 and 2016, which includes\nrestriction of five years as to the age of manufacture of a\nvehicle to be imported. In fact none of the Motors Vehicles,\nsubject matter of instant cases, is less than 5 years old\nrather, they are mostly old Models of 1998 to 2004,\ntherefore, reference to provisions of Section 211 of the\nCustoms Act, 1969, becomes relevant as it provides that\nrecord required under subsection (i) of Section 211 of\nthe Customs Act, 1969, in respect of any imported\nitem shall be kept for a period of not less than five\nyears in such form as the Board may by Notification\nin the official gazette, specify. In other words, any\nimporter or owner of the imported items is under no legal\nobligation to maintain any record pertaining to import\nbeyond the period of five years under the Customs Act,\n1969, nor the Customs Authorities can demand such\nrecord under the Customs Act, 1969, hence non-\navailability of customs documents, older than five years,\nparticularly in cases of Registered Motor Vehicles, would\nnot attract the provisions of Section 2(s) read with Section\n156(1)(89) and (90) of the Customs Act, 1969.\n\n8. We would now examine the provisions of Section 187 of\nthe Customs Act, 1969, relating to discharge of burden of\nproof, according to which, when any person alleged to\nhave committed an offence under this Act, and any\nquestion arises whether he did any act or was in\npossession of anything with lawful authority or under a\npermit, license or other document prescribed by or under\nany law for the time being in force, the burden of proving\nthat he had such authority, permit, license or other\n\nCivil Petition No. 288-P/2025 i\n\ndocument shall be upon such person. In all the above\nreferences and the petitions, it has been noted that\noriginal Registration Book issued by Motor Vehicle\nRegistration Authority in respect of subject vehicles, along\nwith Customs Auction documents, Bank Challans towards\npayment of Additional duty and taxes. Form of Transfer\nOrder, Capital Value Tax (CVT), Registration Fee and other\ncharges were produced before the Customs Authorities to\njustify the lawful ownership/possession towards\ndischarge of initial burden of proof in terms of Section 187\nof the Customs Act, 1969. In the afore cited judgment, the\nlearned Divisional Bench of this Court has elaborately\ndilated upon all the above legal issues related to discharge\nof burden of proof and has been pleased to hold that in\nterms of Section 187 of the Customs Act, 1969, once the\ninitial burden relating to ownership and lawful possession\nof the imported vehicle has been discharged through\nproduction of original Registration Book issued by the\nMotor Vehicle Registration Authority or any other\ndocument prescribed by law or under any other law for\nthe time being in force, then burden shifts upon the\nCustoms Authorities to establish that either the Documents\nproduced are forged, bogus or the same have been\nobtained illegally, hence of no legal consequences.\nHowever, in these cases, no proceedings, whatsoever,\nappear to have been initiated either against the previous\nowners of the subject vehicles, whose particulars have\nbeen provided by the respondents to the Customs\nAuthorities to verify the mode and manner in which such\nvehicles were brought into Pakistan, nor any action\nagainst the officials of the Motor Vehicle Registration\nAuthority. Customs Authorities and the Bank officials has\nbeen taken, for having issued the Registration Books,\nCustom Auction documents and Bank paid challans\nwhich, according to Customs Authorities are forged and\nbogus documents. On the contrary, in the absence of any\nmaterial, inquiry/investigation or any steps required to be\nundertaken for establishing the charge of smuggling in\nterms of Section 2(s), or to make out a case that owners of\nthe vehicles are found in possession of smuggled vehicles\nin terms of Sections 156(1), (89) and (90) of the Customs\nAct, 1969, and even without following the legal course of\nadjudication as provided under Chapter XIX of the\nCustoms Act, 1969, subject vehicles have been\ndetained/seized on the charges of smuggling. In all these\ncases, subject vehicles have been detained / confiscated\nby the Customs Authorities in a highly arbitrary manner\nwhile the same were plying within the territorial city limits,\ninspite of the fact that initial burden to prove the lawful\nownership and possession of subject Registered Vehicles\nwas discharged by the owners through production of\naforesaid documents. Reliance in this regard can be\nplaced in the case of Messrs Muhammad Ateeq Paracha\nand others v. The State (2005 PTD (Trib.) 135) and Abdul\nRazzaq v. Directorate General of Intelligence and\nInvestigation - FBR and 2 others (2016 PTD 1861).”\n\n9. This Court in a recent judgment in the case of Collector\nof Customs v. Messrs Muhammad Tahir Construction\nCompany, Loralai (2019 PTD 1599) while examining the\nscope of importability of Hino Trucks in term of Import\nPolicy Order, 2016 and the provisions of section 187 of the\nCustoms Act, 1969, relating to discharge of burden of\nproof, has been pleased to hold as under:\n\n\"7. Learned counsel for the applicant has not been\n\nCivil Petition No. 288-P/2025 8\n\nable to point out any factual error or illegality in the\nimpugned order passed by the Customs Appellate\nTribunal in the instant case, nor could assist this\nCourt as to how, on the basis of a purported\ncertificate obtained from local manufacturer of Hino\nPak Truck, the age of imported Hino Truck can be\nascertained. Moreover. record shows _ that\nrespondent has discharged the initial burden to\nprove that the subject vehicles were imported in\nconformity with paragraph 9Q(ii)(5) of the Import\nPolicy Order, 2016, whereas, applicant has failed to\nproduce any evidence or material which could\notherwise support the allegations of violation of\npara 9ii)(5) of the Import Policy Order, 2016. The\nratio of the case relied upon by learned counsel for\nrespondent as referred to hereinabove is also\nsquarely attracted to the facts of the instant case.\n\n8. Accordingly, we do not find any substance in the\ninstant Reference Application, whereas, the finding\nas recorded by the Appellate Tribunal in the instant\ncase is predominately based on the findings of\nfacts which does not suffer from any factual error\nor legal infirmity, hence does not require any\ninterference by this Court. Reference in this regard\ncan be made to the case of Irom Ghee Mills v.\nCommissioner of Income Tax 2000 SCMR 1871.\nAccordingly, the proposed questions are answered\nin negative against the applicant and in favour of\nthe respondent.\"\n\n10. To be more specific about the brief facts and the legal\nissues involved in all these cases we deem it appropriate to\nmention the same in following terms so that there remains no\nambiguity regarding the facts and the legal controversies\ninvolved in all these cases. In C.P. No.D-5230 of 2014, the\ndescription of subject vehicle has been given as Toyota Land\nCruiser, bearing Registration No.BD-6648, Model 1998,\nChassis No.HDT-101-0004534 and Engine No.015719. The\npetitioner has attached registration book, issued by Excise\nand Taxation Department, Government of Sindh along with\ncustoms auction documents issued by Director General,\nIntelligence and Investigation (Customs and _ Excise),\nGovernment of Pakistan, including Certificate under Rule 72,\npaid bank challan of the bidding amount i.e. CVT, registration\ncharges, transfer charges etc., and Form of Transfer Order. In\nC.P. No.D-7527/2017, the description of subject vehicle has\nbeen given as Toyota Hilux Surf, bearing Registration No.BF-\n6328, Model 2001, Chassis No VZN185-9056058, Engine\nNo.5VZFE-1269447, whereas, petitioner has attached\nregistration book, issued by Excise and Taxation Department,\nGovernment of Sindh along with customs auction documents\nissued by Collectorate of Customs Appraisement, AICT,\nMauripur Road, Karachi, including Certificate under Rule 72,\npaid bank challan of the bidding amount i.e. CVT, registration\ncharges, transfer charges etc., and Form of Transfer Order. In\nC.P.No D-3351/2017, the description of subject vehicle has\nbeen given as BMW Sports Car, bearing registration No BEE-\n924, Model 2005, Chassis No, WBAEK32050B740093. Engine\nNo N25B3000, whereas, petitioner has attached registration\nbook, issued by Excise and Taxation Department, Government\nof Sindh along with customs auction documents issued by\nModel Collectorate of Customs Appraisement. Karachi,\nincluding Copy of Order-in-Original whereby the petitioner has\nbeen given an option to redeem in terms of SRO 172(I)//2013\ndated 05.03.2013, paid bank challan of additional duties and\n\nCivil Petition No. 288-P/ 2025 9\n\ntaxes, CVT, registration charges, transfer charges etc., and\nForm of Transfer Order. In C.P No.D-5163/2018, the\ndescription of subject vehicle has been given as Toyota Land\nCruiser (Jeep), bearing registration No.BE-0563, Model 2000,\nChassis No.HDT101-00076362UZ9002918, Engine\nNo.T58857, whereas, petitioner has attached registration\nbook, issued by Excise and Taxation Department, Government\nof Sindh along with customs auction documents through\napproved Government auctioneer, paid bank challan of the\nbidding amount ie. CVT, registration charges, transfer\ncharges etc, and Form of Transfer Order. In HCA\nNo.334/2017, the description of subject vehicle has been\ngiven as Toyota Hilux Surf (Jeep), bearing registration\nNo.BF8588, Model 2004, Chassis No.VZN215-0006060,\nEngine No.5VZ-1828615, whereas, the appellant has\nattached Registration Book, issued by Excise and Taxation\nDepartment, Government of Sindh along with customs auction\ndocuments issued by Collectorate of Customs Appraisement\nand Directorate of Intelligence and Investigation, Customs\nHouse, Karachi, including Certificate under Rule 72, paid\nbank challans of the bidding amount, Addl. duty and taxes,\nCVT, Registration charges, transfer charges etc., and Form of\nTransfer Order. In all these cases, the owners have claimed to\nbe owners/subsequent purchases, and have produced the\naforesaid documents to the customs authorities to discharge\nthe initial burden of proof regarding their lawful possession of\nthe subject vehicles in terms of Section 187 of the Customs\nAct, 1969, however, customs authorities, without adopting\nlegal course of adjudications or to establish that the\ndocuments produced by the owners/subsequent purchasers\nare forged or bogus, and the subject vehicles are otherwise\nsmuggled, detained the same in violation of law, merely on\nthe unlawful presumption that since the owners could not\nproduce the import documents of the subject vehicles, which\nare admittedly manufactured beyond the period of five years,\nwhereas, there is no material or even allegation that these\nvehicles have been smuggled within five years from the date\nof their manufacture. If such authority is given to the public\nfunctionaries to charge the owners of the vehicles of a\ncriminal offence of smuggling in the absence of any evidence\nor material to this effect, would amount to giving them\nunbridled powers to act arbitrarily and to abuse the process\nof law, which is neither the intent of law nor could be\napproved by Courts under any circumstances.\n\n11. We have also observed that in some of the cases, there\nhave been allegations by the Customs Authorities that the\nchassis numbers of the vehicles are found tempered,\nhowever, such allegations have been seriously disputed,\nwhereas there has been no specific FSL Report to show as to\nwhether chassis numbers of the vehicles were erased for the\npurpose of theft or for any other purpose. Mere allegation of\ntempering of chassis numbers and such sketchy stereotype\nFSL Report, cannot be considered as conclusive proof to\nestablish a charge of smuggling, particularly, when the make,\nmodel, engine number and other particulars of the vehicles in\nquestion are found to be the same as mentioned in the\ndocuments, including import documents, customs Auction and\nbidding documents, paid bank challans and the original\nRegistration Books issued by the Motor Vehicle Registration\nAuthority. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\nFederation of Pakistan through Director-General of Intelligence\nand Investigation FBR, Karachi v. Muhammad Jamal Rizvi\nand others [2012 PTD 90], while examining the fate of similar\nallegation regarding tempered chassis number and the FSL\n\nCivil Petition No. 288-P/2025 10\n\nReports has been pleased to hold as under: -\n\n\"5. Perusal of the impugned judgment reflects that\nthe FSL Report was not found specific and various\nqueries made by the Investigating Agency remained\nunanswered. In this behalf learned Division Bench\nof the High Court observed that. \"The FSL report\nshows that the chassis numbers on the vehicle\nwere tampered. The FSL report is not specific and\ncreates doubts as to whether the chassis numbers\nof the vehicle were erased for the purpose of theft\nand or for any other purpose. This issue is not\nanswered in the FSL report though the Directorate\nof Customs, Intelligence and Investigation had\nsought report through a letter calling upon FSL to\nspecifically mention the status of chassis numbers.\nThe FSL report is silent on queries made by the\ninvestigating agency, except that chassis numbers\nwere tampered. The report of the FSL was\ninsufficient to authorize the Directorate of Customs,\nIntelligence and Investigation, to detain and or\nseize the vehicle inter alia, on the ground that it\nwas smuggled vehicle.\" When asked, learned\ncounsel had no reply to furnish on the observation\nso made however, he admitted that the make\nmodel. Engine number and other material about the\nvehicle in question were same as were in the\ndocuments noted hereinabove.\"\n\n10. The aforesaid judgment was assailed by the Custom\nAuthorities before this Court in Civil Appeals No. No. 1088, 1231 to\n1236/2013 and Civil Appeals No. 142-K/2015 and 938/2018 and\nCivil Appeals No. 453 to 466/2022 and the aforesaid civil appeals\nhave been recently decided vide judgment dated 17.04.2025.\nUpholding the aforesaid judgment and dismissing the departmental\n\nappeals in following terms: -\n\n12. For the amended SRO's effect, (wherein vehicles were\nincluded), the record of import is required to be kept in terms\nof Section 211(2) for a period of five years ('five\" was\nsubstituted for the word \"three\" by the Finance Act, 2007).\nFor the sake of brevity, such provisions of law is reproduced\nas under:\n\n\"211. Maintenance of record. All importers, exporters\nand claimants of duty drawback, refunds or any\nnotified concessions, terminal operators, owners of the\nwarehouses, customs agents and the licensed customs\nbonded carriers, transport operators and _ tracking\ncompanies, carrying out business under this Act or rules\nmade thereunder or under any other law, directly or\nindirectly, relating to international trade, shall be\nrequired to maintain and keep records and\ncorrespondence concerning import, export and transit\ntrade transactions.\n\n(2) The records required under sub-section (1) shall be\nkept for a period not less than five years in such form\nas the Board may by notification in the official gazette,\nspecify.\n\n(3) The provision of sub-section (1) shall not be\n\nCivil Petition No. 288-P/2025 1%\n\napplicable to the baggage of the passengers and crew of\nthe conveyance and to the recipients of gifts.\"\n\n13. The consequence of this provision appears to be that if\nthe auction of the vehicle took place more than 3 years ago\nfor cases prior to the Finance Act, 2007 and 5 years for\ncases thereafter, there would appear to be a \"lawful excuse\"\nto the person (retaining the possession of vehicle under valid\nregistration), who is accused of an offence under Section\n156(89) or (90) (for not showing required import documents),\nunless it can be demonstrated that he was told or knew that\nduties and taxes were not paid and the same were required\nto be paid.\n\n14. For auctioned vehicles such as in SCRA No. 263 of 2010\n(Civil Appeal No.1235 of 2013), the vehicle in question was\nauctioned on or about 25.11.1999, having registration\nNo.BD-0689 dated 24.06.2005 and was intercepted on or\nabout 09.10.2008. In these circumstances, Section 211(2)\nseems to provide a \"lawful excuse\" since no adverse\ninference for failure to produce the documents can be drawn\nafter the lapse of period provided in Section 211(2) to be\ncounted at-least from date of registration if not before, as\nauction date in other vehicles is also a legitimate claim to\ncount time. The vehicle in question was in Pakistan on or\nabout 25.11.1999, ie. the date of auction, and the said\nperiod expired before the vehicle was intercepted on or about\n09.10.2008. There does not appear to be anything on the\nrecord to suggest that as per the terms of the auction, the\nauction purchaser had to pay duties and taxes applicable in\nrespect of the import of the auctioned vehicle. Similarly, in all\nother cases where (not auctioned cases) the registration\nrecord with Motor Registration Authority and registration\nbooks (duly verified) are available, the subject period of 3/5\nyears would apply to give beneficial effect of Section 211 to\nthose having custody and registration in their names.\n\n15. The provisions of Section 174 of Income Tax Ordinance\n2001, for present controversy is pari materia to Section 211\nof the Act. The provisions of 174 of the Ordinance was\ndiscussed at length in Panther Sports' specially in para-5.\nSince the two provisions are pari materia therefore by\napplying doctrine of statutory construction there cannot be a\ndifferent interpretation of section 211 of Customs Act than\nthe one given in the said judgment for section 174 of the\nIncome Tax Ordinance, 2001.\n\n16. So in cases of registered vehicles, if at the time the\nvehicle being intercepted, more than 3 years have elapsed for\ncases prior to the Finance Act, 2007 and 5 years for cases\nthereafter, the defence of \"lawful excuse\" appears to be\nindefeasible. This is also because it is reasonable to assume\nthat if a vehicle stands registered, the government is\npresumed to have exercised due care and diligence with\nrespect to its obligation to see whatever duties and taxes as\npayable to the government before a vehicle can be registered,\nstand paid. It must also be noted that the vehicles being\nregistered, which registration was duly verified, is presumed\nto have been brought lawfully; after completion of notified\nperiod in case of used vehicles also. It seems harsh, to say\nthe least, if without any proof that a person (last owner) was\ninvolved in the registration of the vehicle knowing fully well\nthat no duties and taxes, as required under the law, were\npaid, and that therefore the vehicle was fraudulently\nregistered, the vehicle be seized from him on his failure to\nproduce documents of import and payment of duties and\n\nCivil Petition No. 288-P/2025 12\n\ntaxes thereon and even that beyond the period of three years\nor five years, as the case may be, as required under section\n211(2). In most of the cases since first registration, the\nvehicles changed many owners on the strength of\nregistration book and no adverse inference could be drawn\nfor the ultimate bonafide owners unless otherwise proved\ncontrary by appellant, in which exercise the appellant\ndepartment has failed below. The verified registration book\nand official record is enough for bonafide presumption that a\nvalid title exist.\n\n17. The Motor Vehicle Ordinance, 1965 provides the\nmechanism for registration of motor vehicles in terms of its\nsections from 23 to 43. Section 27 of ibid law even provides\nthe production of the vehicle at the time of registration and if\nthe registration of a vehicle passes through this statutory\nprocess conducted by officials responsible under M.V.O\n1965, then presumption of truthfulness is eminent.\n\n18. One must bear in mind that there is a distinction between\nthe expression \"lawful authority\" contained in Section 187\nand the expression \"lawful excuse\" contained in clause 89 of\nSection 156 (1). The distinction in both is reproduced as\nunder:\n\nSection 187\nBurden of proof as to\n\nlawful authority ete.\nWhen any person is\nalleged to have\n\ncommitted an _ offence\nunder this Act and any\nquestion arises whether\nhe did any act or was in\npossession of anything\nwith lawful authority or\nunder a permit, license\nor other document\nprescribed by or under\nany law for the time\nbeing in force, the\nburden of proving that\nhe had such authority,\npermit, license or other\ndocument shall lie on\nhim:\n\nProvided that any\nperson, alleged to have\ncommitted an _ offence\nunder this Act, shall\nbear the burden of proof\nthat any property owned\nby him in his name or\nsomeone else name was\nnot acquired from the\nproceeds of such crime:\n\nProvided further that the\nprocedure for forfeiture\nof such property shall be\nprescribed by the Board\nunder the rules.\n\nClause 89 of Section 156(1)\n\nIf any person without lawful\nexcuse, the proof of which shall\nbe on such person, acquires\npossession of, or is in any way\nconcerned in carrying, removing,\ndepositing, harbouring, keeping\nor concealing, retailing or in any\nmanner dealing with smuggled\ngoods or any goods in respect to\nwhich there may be reasonable\nsuspicion that they are\nsmuggled goods\n\n\nCivil Petition No. 288-P/2025 13\n\n19. To apply Section 187 to clauses (89) and (90) of Section\n156 would amount to limit or narrow down the scope of what\nis permissible under the said clauses of Section 156 of the\nAct as a defence; and that cannot be done. The legislature\nwas conscious while using the two legal phrases which have\ndifferent connotation. Section 187 in general deals with\nburden of proof as to lawful authority whereas Section 156\ndeals with punishment for offence. In this context, Section\n187 can be regarded as a general provision whereas clauses\n(89) and (90) are specific provisions and in such a situation\nthe specific provisions (to the context) must apply to the\nevent/situation under discussion. As such, the accused\npersons are entitled only to demonstrate a lawful excuse to\ndischarge themselves from the allegation under the said\nclauses even where the law is conceived to have been\nviolated in respect of the goods i.e. the goods are smuggled\ngoods in absence of import documents, and that is possible\ncourtesy statutory period, (disclosed in Section 211) followed\nby registration book through an official act under the law. A\nstrong presumption is thus attached as a statutory act was\nperformed in the registration of vehicle.\n\n20. The distinction between lawful authority and lawful\nexcuse was highlighted by the Privy Council in the judgment\nreported as PLD 1955 PC 29 by holding that the defence of\nlawful excuse may be sufficiently proved although no lawful\nauthority exists for doing what is charged against the\naccused. Lawful excuse is an expression that is of wider\nimport and lesser degree of burden than lawful authority. It\nfollows from this that proving a lawful excuse, which falls\nshort of lawful authority, it is the excuse put forward by the\naccused, rather than handling smuggled goods, that must be\nshown to be lawful.\n\n21. Conceiving the events discussed in show-cause notices\nwith above analysis as a common tool, it demonstrates that\nthe vehicles in question are actually those which were\nregistered through a statutory process and were duly verified\nand hence would carry lawful excuse.\n\n22. This principle however is distinguished for the case\nwhere vehicles were found with tampered chassis and\nengine numbers. If this is seemingly done to match the\nstatistics of original vehicles auctioned or brought into\nPakistan officially having different chassis/engine number,\nthe lawful excuse may not be applicable in case of tampered\nvehicle. This would not include those vehicles which were\nacquired via auction report explicitly disclosing such\ntampering and tampered statistics. Also at times the engine\nand chassis numbers are changed which are also excluded\nfrom any action, provided it was done with prior permission\nof the authority under the Motor Vehicles Ordinance, 1965.\nAll this require thorough probe at the end to applicant which\nagain is a question of fact not required to be determined by\nus afresh.\n\n23. Learned counsel for the responded/department has\nmainly emphasized that a proper procedure was adopted\nwhile initiating confiscation and/or seizure process. Suffice\nto say that applying right procedure on wrong person and at\nthe wrong time would not serve any purpose, rather is an\nabuse of process of law and such actions would be of no help\nfor the department to take corrective measure to curb the\nsmuggling. Such actions ought to have been taken at the time\n\nCivil Petition No. 288-P/ 2025 14\n\nwhen vehicles were being registered. The appellants should\nworkout some collaborated efforts before and at the time of\nregistration of such vehicles so that this menace may come to\nan end. A proper joint effort in registration may be a way out.\n\n24. Indeed, the respondents in order to achieve their lawful\nobject of identifying the vehicles and subjected them to such\nexercise, the concerned directorate, on receipt of credible\ninformation of a suspected vehicle from authority concerned,\nincluding but not limited to Motor Registration Authority, may\ntake requisite steps. In conducting such exercise a lady\ncustom officer and a lady sepoy should also be aligned to\nensure privacy and respect; legal requirement including\nsearch under section 162 of the Act be followed and\ninconvenience to the family must be avoided.\n\n25. The conclusion in the above analysis is that the vehicles\nin question are those which were either auctioned or were\nbrought into Pakistan and were registered through a\nstatutory process and that the auction papers or registration\npapers of some other vehicles are not being used\nfraudulently, however, where it is established that the\nchassis/engine numbers have been tampered with after\nauction or registration to match the description of the\nauctioned or registered vehicle, the lawful excuse is not\navailable.\n\nit The extensive reproduction of the judgment of the High\nCourt of Sindh in the case reported as 2021 PTD 1683 and the\njudgment of the three-member bench of this Court in Civil Appeals\nNo. 1088, 1231 to 1236/2013 (and others) dated 17.04.2025,\nwhereby, the judgment of High Court of Sindh has been duly upheld,\nhas been made to appreciate that the legal issues involved in the\naforesaid cases and the questions of law arising from the impugned\norder passed by the Peshawar High Court, Peshawar in the instant\nmatter have already been dealt with and answered through\nauthoritative pronouncement by this Court in the aforesaid Civil\nAppeals, hence requires no further elaboration on the settled legal\nissues.

            "CleanedText": "JUDGMENT Ageel Ahmed Abbasi J.- The instant petition for leave to appeal is filed by the petitioner under Article 185 3 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. The petitioner has challenged the impugned order dated 12.02.2025 passed by the Division Bench of Peshawar High Court, Peshawar in Custom Reference Application No. 154-P/2024, whereby the reference filed under Section 196 of the Customs Act 1969, hereinafter referred to as the Act against the judgment dated 04.11.2024 passed by the Custom Appellate Tribunal, Peshawar Special Division Bench , was dismissed. 2. Brief facts of the case as recorded by the Division Bench of Peshawar High Court in the impugned order while deciding the aforesaid reference application are that the staff of the Field Intelligence Unit, Mardan intercepted a Toyota Corolla Motorcar bearing Registration No. BA-1812/Peshawar hereinafter referred to as the subject vehicle at Charsadda Road, Peshawar. On demand, the driver Muhammad Jamil son of Damsaz produced a GD No. KAPR-HC-137314 dated 06.04.2006 showing the import of a used Toyota Corolla Car Model 2003 chassis No. NZE120-3027717. The Civil Petition No. 288-P/2025 2 vehicle was brought to the office of Intelligence and Investigation Customs Peshawar and was detained in terms of section 17 of the Act. Accordingly, a letter dated 30.10.2022 was sent to Junior User Support Officer, Intelligence Investigation PRAL , Hayatabad, Peshawar to verify the import status of the vehicle and in response, it was reported vide letter dated 02.01.2022 that the record of the vehicle pertaining to chassis No. NZE120-3027717 could not be traced in one customs database. Further, the Director FSL, Peshawar was also requested vide letter dated 02.11.2022 to chemically examine the chassis number of the vehicle and through letter dated 08.11.2022, the Director FSL submitted his report, according to which, no other number has been deciphered in its chassis number. As there was reason to believe that the foreign-origin Toyota Corolla Motorcar was a non-duty paid/smuggled one and was brought into the country through unauthorized routes without payment of leviable duty/taxes; therefore, the vehicle was seized on 10.11.2022 in terms of section 168 1 of the Act for violation of section 2 s and 16 of the Act read with section 3 1 of the Imports and Exports Control Act, 1950 and SRO 566 1 /2005 dated 06.06.2005 punishable under section 156 1 clause 8 and 89 of the Act read with section 3 3 of the Imports and Exports Control Act, 1950 and SRO 499 1 /2009 dated 13.06.2009. After completion of requisite formalities, the matter was placed before the Collector of Customs Adjudication , Islamabad, who vie order-in-original 39/2023 dated 08.02.2023 ordered for outright confiscation of the vehicle. The respondents feeling aggrieved filed an appeal bearing No. Cus-160/PB/2023 before the worthy Tribunal. The Worthy Tribunal allowed the appeal and released the vehicle to the owner unconditionally vide impugned judgment dated 04.11.2024 . 3. The Division Bench of the Peshawar High Court after hearing the learned counsel for the petitioner and scrutiny of entire record while referring to the relevant provisions of the Customs Act, 1969 as well as the provisions of West Pakistan Motor Vehicles Ordinance, 1965 was pleased to dismiss the reference application by holding that the seizure of the subject vehicle by the Custom Authorities on the allegations of its being smuggled vehicle was unlawful. It has been further held that in view of the fact that the subject vehicle was duly registered under Section 25 of the West Pakistan Motor Vehicles Ordinance, 1965, the presumption of truth Civil Petition No. 288-P/2025 3 was attached to the official document of registration hence, the burden under Section 187 of the Act was shifted from the owner of subject vehicle upon the Custom Authorities to establish that subject vehicle was unlawfully imported. While reaching to such conclusion the Division Bench of Peshawar High Court, Peshawar has further held that since the subject vehicle was more than 5 years old at the time of its confiscation by the Custom Authorities, therefore, in view of Section 211 of the Act the owner of the subject vehicle was not under legal obligation to keep the record of such import beyond the period of 5 years. Accordingly, the reference filed by the Custom Authorities before the Peshawar High Court was dismissed and the order passed by the Custom Appellate Tribunal was upheld. 4. The learned counsel for the petitioner while referring to the questions proposed in the instant civil petition for leave to appeal vehemently argued that the controversy involved in the instant case relates to the authority of the officials of Directorate of Intelligence, Customs, to intercept any imported vehicle while plying on road for the purposes of verification of its lawful import, payment of duty and taxes etc. Whereas, the burden to prove that such vehicle is lawfully imported is upon the importer/owner of said vehicle in terms of Section 187 of the Act and in case the importer/owner of subject vehicle fails to discharge the burden, than the said vehicle can be seized in terms of section 168 1 of the Act for violation of section 2 s and 16 of the Act read with section 3 1 of the Imports and Exports Control Act, 1950 and SRO 566 1 /2005 dated 06.06.2005 punishable under section 156 1 clause 8 and 89 of the Act read with section 3 3 of the Imports and Exports Control Act, 1950 and SRO 499 1 /2009 dated 13.06.2009. According to the learned counsel for the petitioner the Customs Appellate Tribunal and the Hon ble Division Bench of Peshawar High Court, Peshawar have erred in law and facts while holding that the burden of proof regarding the lawful import of subject vehicle was lawfully discharged by the importer/owner of subject vehicle in view of Registration of the subject vehicle under Section 25 of the West Pakistan Motor Registration Authority which fact alone is sufficient to discharge such burden in terms of Section 187 of the Act. It has been prayed that the impugned order may be set aside and instant civil petition for leave to appeal may be allowed. 5. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, perused the Civil Petition No. 288-P/2025 4 record and the impugned order passed by the Division Bench of Peshawar High Court, Peshawar in the above aforesaid reference application with his assistance. 6. Since the facts as recorded by the Division Bench of Peshawar High Court are not disputed by the learned counsel for the petitioner, therefore, we need not further elaborate the factual position and would decide the legal issues involved in the instant case, including seizure of an imported vehicle duly registered in Pakistan by the Motor Vehicle Registration Authority by the Custom Authorities, while plying on the road within the city limits, by invoking the provisions of Section 168 1 of the Act requiring the owner to show the import documents and in case of failure by the owner of such import documents, to seize the same on the presumption that such vehicle is a smuggled vehicle. th It is pertinent to note that the questions as proposed in the instant civil petition for leave to appeal as decided by the Custom Appellate Tribunal and the Division Bench of Peshawar High Court, Peshawar in aforesaid reference application have already been dealt with in detail by the Division Bench of High Court of Sindh in the case of the Additional Director, Directorate General of Intelligence and Investigation-FBR, Regional Office, Karachi and another v. Imran Khan and another 2021 PTD 1683 in Special Custom Reference Application No. 110/2014 alongwith others. It will be advantageous to reproduce the proposed questions of law which have been decided by the Division Bench of High Court of Sindh in the aforesaid cited case which read as follows: 1. Whether banned goods Notified vide Serial No. 26 of SRO 566 I /2005 dated 06.06.2005, issued for the purpose of Sections 2 s and 156 2 of the Customs Act, 1969, could be released by the learned Customs Appellate Tribunal without any discussion much less examination and analysis of the facts and law involved? 2. Whether the learned Member Technical , Appellate Tribunal, Bench-II, Karachi, has seriously erred in law by not taking notice and giving findings on the evidence of Chemical Examination Report No.AIG/FD/OR/274/2012 dated 06.11.2012, confirming therein tampering of the chassis frame? 3. Whether the learned Member Technical , Appellate Tribunal, Bench-II, Karachi, while concluding the impugned judgment has seriously erred in law and failed to understand that in terms of subsection 2 of Section 156 and Section 187 of the Customs Act, 1969, the respondent/ possession holder of the vehicle has failed to Civil Petition No. 288-P/2025 5 8. discharge burden of proof of lawful possession? 4, Whether registration of smuggled vehicle, having tampered chassis number with Motor Registration Authority Civic Centre, Karachi can regularize a smuggled vehicle and absolve it from penal action under the Customs Act, 1969? 5. Whether importation and registration, in context of vehicles, are not different and distinct concepts, the former being under the Customs Act, 1969 and the latter being the Provincial subject and whether mere registration of vehicle absolves the owner/ possessor of a vehicle to prove its legal importation under the Customs Act, 1969? However, above proposed questions were reframed in the following terms: 9. i Whether a motor vehicle, duly registered with the Excise and Taxation Department under the Motor Vehicle Registration Ordinance, 1965, can be detained/seized by the Customs Authorities on the charges of smuggling in terms of Section 2 S read with Section 156 1 89 and 90 of the Customs Act, 1969, if the owner is not in possession of the import documents? ii Whether the Customs Authorities can ask for production of record including import documents from owner in respect of a Motor Vehicle or any other importable item, beyond the period of five years in terms of Section 211 of the Customs Act, 1969? iii Whether the Registration Book, Customs Auction Documents, Form of Transfer Order, Bank challans towards payments of additional duty and taxes, capital value tax CVT , registration fee transfer fee and other charges, unless proved to be bogus and forged, constitute other documents prescribed by or under any law for the time being in force in terms of Section 187 of the Customs Act, 1969? iv Whether production of documents as prescribed by or under any law for the time being in force by the owner in respect of a motor vehicle or any other importable item shifts the burden of proof from the owner, upon the Customs Authorities to establish the charge of smuggling through positive evidence or any concrete material to the contrary, in terms of Section 2 s read with Section 156 1 89 and 90 of Customs Act, 1969? Perusal of hereinabove questions shows that the controversy involved in the above mentioned case is identical to questions involved in the instant case, therefore, the decision on the aforesaid questions has a direct bearing on the legal issues involved in the instant case, hence the relevant findings on the said issues are reproduced as under: 7. We have reproduced the relevant facts, questions proposed and the findings recorded thereon by the Divisional Bench of this Court in the aforesaid reference application at length, as we are of the view that the facts and legal issues involved in all these cases are similar to the facts and legal issues of the above cited case, and, Civil Petition No. 288-P/2025 6 therefore, would be relevant to decide the questions of law and legal points involved in these reference applications and the connected petitions as well as High Court Appeal. As we have already observed that in none of these cases, there is any allegation against the owners/subsequent purchases for having committed an act of smuggling in terms of Section 2 s of the Customs Act, 1969, as neither they have imported subject vehicles nor they have brought such vehicles into Pakistan from routes other than specified under Section 9 or 10 from any place other than a Customs Station, nor any evidence or material has been produced by the Customs Authorities, which could otherwise establish that documents produced, e.g. Registration Books issued by Excise and Taxation Department, Motor Vehicle Registration Authority, Government of Sindh, Form of Transfer Order, the sale/purchase agreements, the Custom Auction documents, Bank Challans towards payment of Additional Customs duty and taxes, CVT, registration fee, transfer fee and other charges etc., produced in respect of subject vehicles, are forged or bogus documents. Admittedly, all the owners of the subject vehicles in these cases are second, third or even fifth owners, and have supplied the above documents which, prima-facie, show that initial burden of proof to the effect that they are the bona fide lawful owners/purchasers of the subject vehicles and have not committed any act of smuggling nor they are in possession of smuggled vehicles. The subject vehicles do not fall within the category of banned items as defined in Appendix-A of the Import Policy Order, 2009, 2012, and 2016, however, their import is subject to certain conditions prescribed by the Federal Government through Notifications issued in terms of Section 2 s ti read with section 156 2 of the Customs Act, 1969, Import Policy Orders, 2009, 2012, 2013 and 2016, which includes restriction of five years as to the age of manufacture of a vehicle to be imported. In fact none of the Motors Vehicles, subject matter of instant cases, is less than 5 years old rather, they are mostly old Models of 1998 to 2004, therefore, reference to provisions of Section 211 of the Customs Act, 1969, becomes relevant as it provides that record required under subsection i of Section 211 of the Customs Act, 1969, in respect of any imported item shall be kept for a period of not less than five years in such form as the Board may by Notification in the official gazette, specify. In other words, any importer or owner of the imported items is under no legal obligation to maintain any record pertaining to import beyond the period of five years under the Customs Act, 1969, nor the Customs Authorities can demand such record under the Customs Act, 1969, hence nonavailability of customs documents, older than five years, particularly in cases of Registered Motor Vehicles, would not attract the provisions of Section 2 s read with Section 156 1 89 and 90 of the Customs Act, 1969. 8. We would now examine the provisions of Section 187 of the Customs Act, 1969, relating to discharge of burden of proof, according to which, when any person alleged to have committed an offence under this Act, and any question arises whether he did any act or was in possession of anything with lawful authority or under a permit, license or other document prescribed by or under any law for the time being in force, the burden of proving that he had such authority, permit, license or other Civil Petition No. 288-P/2025 i document shall be upon such person. In all the above references and the petitions, it has been noted that original Registration Book issued by Motor Vehicle Registration Authority in respect of subject vehicles, along with Customs Auction documents, Bank Challans towards payment of Additional duty and taxes. Form of Transfer Order, Capital Value Tax CVT , Registration Fee and other charges were produced before the Customs Authorities to justify the lawful ownership/possession towards discharge of initial burden of proof in terms of Section 187 of the Customs Act, 1969. In the afore cited judgment, the learned Divisional Bench of this Court has elaborately dilated upon all the above legal issues related to discharge of burden of proof and has been pleased to hold that in terms of Section 187 of the Customs Act, 1969, once the initial burden relating to ownership and lawful possession of the imported vehicle has been discharged through production of original Registration Book issued by the Motor Vehicle Registration Authority or any other document prescribed by law or under any other law for the time being in force, then burden shifts upon the Customs Authorities to establish that either the Documents produced are forged, bogus or the same have been obtained illegally, hence of no legal consequences. However, in these cases, no proceedings, whatsoever, appear to have been initiated either against the previous owners of the subject vehicles, whose particulars have been provided by the respondents to the Customs Authorities to verify the mode and manner in which such vehicles were brought into Pakistan, nor any action against the officials of the Motor Vehicle Registration Authority. Customs Authorities and the Bank officials has been taken, for having issued the Registration Books, Custom Auction documents and Bank paid challans which, according to Customs Authorities are forged and bogus documents. On the contrary, in the absence of any material, inquiry/investigation or any steps required to be undertaken for establishing the charge of smuggling in terms of Section 2 s , or to make out a case that owners of the vehicles are found in possession of smuggled vehicles in terms of Sections 156 1 , 89 and 90 of the Customs Act, 1969, and even without following the legal course of adjudication as provided under Chapter XIX of the Customs Act, 1969, subject vehicles have been detained/seized on the charges of smuggling. In all these cases, subject vehicles have been detained / confiscated by the Customs Authorities in a highly arbitrary manner while the same were plying within the territorial city limits, inspite of the fact that initial burden to prove the lawful ownership and possession of subject Registered Vehicles was discharged by the owners through production of aforesaid documents. Reliance in this regard can be placed in the case of Messrs Muhammad Ateeq Paracha and others v. The State 2005 PTD Trib. 135 and Abdul Razzaq v. Directorate General of Intelligence and Investigation - FBR and 2 others 2016 PTD 1861 . 9. This Court in a recent judgment in the case of Collector of Customs v. Messrs Muhammad Tahir Construction Company, Loralai 2019 PTD 1599 while examining the scope of importability of Hino Trucks in term of Import Policy Order, 2016 and the provisions of section 187 of the Customs Act, 1969, relating to discharge of burden of proof, has been pleased to hold as under: 7. Learned counsel for the applicant has not been Civil Petition No. 288-P/2025 8 able to point out any factual error or illegality in the impugned order passed by the Customs Appellate Tribunal in the instant case, nor could assist this Court as to how, on the basis of a purported certificate obtained from local manufacturer of Hino Pak Truck, the age of imported Hino Truck can be ascertained. Moreover. record shows that respondent has discharged the initial burden to prove that the subject vehicles were imported in conformity with paragraph 9Q ii 5 of the Import Policy Order, 2016, whereas, applicant has failed to produce any evidence or material which could otherwise support the allegations of violation of para 9ii 5 of the Import Policy Order, 2016. The ratio of the case relied upon by learned counsel for respondent as referred to hereinabove is also squarely attracted to the facts of the instant case. 8. Accordingly, we do not find any substance in the instant Reference Application, whereas, the finding as recorded by the Appellate Tribunal in the instant case is predominately based on the findings of facts which does not suffer from any factual error or legal infirmity, hence does not require any interference by this Court. Reference in this regard can be made to the case of Irom Ghee Mills v. Commissioner of Income Tax 2000 SCMR 1871. Accordingly, the proposed questions are answered in negative against the applicant and in favour of the respondent. 10. To be more specific about the brief facts and the legal issues involved in all these cases we deem it appropriate to mention the same in following terms so that there remains no ambiguity regarding the facts and the legal controversies involved in all these cases. In C.P. No.D-5230 of 2014, the description of subject vehicle has been given as Toyota Land Cruiser, bearing Registration No.BD-6648, Model 1998, Chassis No.HDT-101-0004534 and Engine No.015719. The petitioner has attached registration book, issued by Excise and Taxation Department, Government of Sindh along with customs auction documents issued by Director General, Intelligence and Investigation Customs and Excise , Government of Pakistan, including Certificate under Rule 72, paid bank challan of the bidding amount i.e. CVT, registration charges, transfer charges etc., and Form of Transfer Order. In C.P. No.D-7527/2017, the description of subject vehicle has been given as Toyota Hilux Surf, bearing Registration No.BF6328, Model 2001, Chassis No VZN185-9056058, Engine No.5VZFE-1269447, whereas, petitioner has attached registration book, issued by Excise and Taxation Department, Government of Sindh along with customs auction documents issued by Collectorate of Customs Appraisement, AICT, Mauripur Road, Karachi, including Certificate under Rule 72, paid bank challan of the bidding amount i.e. CVT, registration charges, transfer charges etc., and Form of Transfer Order. In C.P.No D-3351/2017, the description of subject vehicle has been given as BMW Sports Car, bearing registration No BEE924, Model 2005, Chassis No, WBAEK32050B740093. Engine No N25B3000, whereas, petitioner has attached registration book, issued by Excise and Taxation Department, Government of Sindh along with customs auction documents issued by Model Collectorate of Customs Appraisement. Karachi, including Copy of Order-in-Original whereby the petitioner has been given an option to redeem in terms of SRO 172 I //2013 dated 05.03.2013, paid bank challan of additional duties and Civil Petition No. 288-P/ 2025 9 taxes, CVT, registration charges, transfer charges etc., and Form of Transfer Order. In C.P No.D-5163/2018, the description of subject vehicle has been given as Toyota Land Cruiser Jeep , bearing registration No.BE-0563, Model 2000, Chassis No.HDT101-00076362UZ9002918, Engine No.T58857, whereas, petitioner has attached registration book, issued by Excise and Taxation Department, Government of Sindh along with customs auction documents through approved Government auctioneer, paid bank challan of the bidding amount ie. CVT, registration charges, transfer charges etc, and Form of Transfer Order. In HCA No.334/2017, the description of subject vehicle has been given as Toyota Hilux Surf Jeep , bearing registration No.BF8588, Model 2004, Chassis No.VZN215-0006060, Engine No.5VZ-1828615, whereas, the appellant has attached Registration Book, issued by Excise and Taxation Department, Government of Sindh along with customs auction documents issued by Collectorate of Customs Appraisement and Directorate of Intelligence and Investigation, Customs House, Karachi, including Certificate under Rule 72, paid bank challans of the bidding amount, Addl. duty and taxes, CVT, Registration charges, transfer charges etc., and Form of Transfer Order. In all these cases, the owners have claimed to be owners/subsequent purchases, and have produced the aforesaid documents to the customs authorities to discharge the initial burden of proof regarding their lawful possession of the subject vehicles in terms of Section 187 of the Customs Act, 1969, however, customs authorities, without adopting legal course of adjudications or to establish that the documents produced by the owners/subsequent purchasers are forged or bogus, and the subject vehicles are otherwise smuggled, detained the same in violation of law, merely on the unlawful presumption that since the owners could not produce the import documents of the subject vehicles, which are admittedly manufactured beyond the period of five years, whereas, there is no material or even allegation that these vehicles have been smuggled within five years from the date of their manufacture. If such authority is given to the public functionaries to charge the owners of the vehicles of a criminal offence of smuggling in the absence of any evidence or material to this effect, would amount to giving them unbridled powers to act arbitrarily and to abuse the process of law, which is neither the intent of law nor could be approved by Courts under any circumstances. 11. We have also observed that in some of the cases, there have been allegations by the Customs Authorities that the chassis numbers of the vehicles are found tempered, however, such allegations have been seriously disputed, whereas there has been no specific FSL Report to show as to whether chassis numbers of the vehicles were erased for the purpose of theft or for any other purpose. Mere allegation of tempering of chassis numbers and such sketchy stereotype FSL Report, cannot be considered as conclusive proof to establish a charge of smuggling, particularly, when the make, model, engine number and other particulars of the vehicles in question are found to be the same as mentioned in the documents, including import documents, customs Auction and bidding documents, paid bank challans and the original Registration Books issued by the Motor Vehicle Registration Authority. The Hon ble Supreme Court in the case of Federation of Pakistan through Director-General of Intelligence and Investigation FBR, Karachi v. Muhammad Jamal Rizvi and others 2012 PTD 90 , while examining the fate of similar allegation regarding tempered chassis number and the FSL Civil Petition No. 288-P/2025 10 Reports has been pleased to hold as under: - 5. Perusal of the impugned judgment reflects that the FSL Report was not found specific and various queries made by the Investigating Agency remained unanswered. In this behalf learned Division Bench of the High Court observed that. The FSL report shows that the chassis numbers on the vehicle were tampered. The FSL report is not specific and creates doubts as to whether the chassis numbers of the vehicle were erased for the purpose of theft and or for any other purpose. This issue is not answered in the FSL report though the Directorate of Customs, Intelligence and Investigation had sought report through a letter calling upon FSL to specifically mention the status of chassis numbers. The FSL report is silent on queries made by the investigating agency, except that chassis numbers were tampered. The report of the FSL was insufficient to authorize the Directorate of Customs, Intelligence and Investigation, to detain and or seize the vehicle inter alia, on the ground that it was smuggled vehicle. When asked, learned counsel had no reply to furnish on the observation so made however, he admitted that the make model. Engine number and other material about the vehicle in question were same as were in the documents noted hereinabove. 10. The aforesaid judgment was assailed by the Custom Authorities before this Court in Civil Appeals No. No. 1088, 1231 to 1236/2013 and Civil Appeals No. 142-K/2015 and 938/2018 and Civil Appeals No. 453 to 466/2022 and the aforesaid civil appeals have been recently decided vide judgment dated 17.04.2025. Upholding the aforesaid judgment and dismissing the departmental appeals in following terms: - 12. For the amended SRO s effect, wherein vehicles were included , the record of import is required to be kept in terms of Section 211 2 for a period of five years five was substituted for the word three by the Finance Act, 2007 . For the sake of brevity, such provisions of law is reproduced as under: 211. Maintenance of record. All importers, exporters and claimants of duty drawback, refunds or any notified concessions, terminal operators, owners of the warehouses, customs agents and the licensed customs bonded carriers, transport operators and tracking companies, carrying out business under this Act or rules made thereunder or under any other law, directly or indirectly, relating to international trade, shall be required to maintain and keep records and correspondence concerning import, export and transit trade transactions. 2 The records required under sub-section 1 shall be kept for a period not less than five years in such form as the Board may by notification in the official gazette, specify. 3 The provision of sub-section 1 shall not be Civil Petition No. 288-P/2025 1 applicable to the baggage of the passengers and crew of the conveyance and to the recipients of gifts. 13. The consequence of this provision appears to be that if the auction of the vehicle took place more than 3 years ago for cases prior to the Finance Act, 2007 and 5 years for cases thereafter, there would appear to be a lawful excuse to the person retaining the possession of vehicle under valid registration , who is accused of an offence under Section 156 89 or 90 for not showing required import documents , unless it can be demonstrated that he was told or knew that duties and taxes were not paid and the same were required to be paid. 14. For auctioned vehicles such as in SCRA No. 263 of 2010 Civil Appeal No.1235 of 2013 , the vehicle in question was auctioned on or about 25.11.1999, having registration No.BD-0689 dated 24.06.2005 and was intercepted on or about 09.10.2008. In these circumstances, Section 211 2 seems to provide a lawful excuse since no adverse inference for failure to produce the documents can be drawn after the lapse of period provided in Section 211 2 to be counted at-least from date of registration if not before, as auction date in other vehicles is also a legitimate claim to count time. The vehicle in question was in Pakistan on or about 25.11.1999, ie. the date of auction, and the said period expired before the vehicle was intercepted on or about 09.10.2008. There does not appear to be anything on the record to suggest that as per the terms of the auction, the auction purchaser had to pay duties and taxes applicable in respect of the import of the auctioned vehicle. Similarly, in all other cases where not auctioned cases the registration record with Motor Registration Authority and registration books duly verified are available, the subject period of 3/5 years would apply to give beneficial effect of Section 211 to those having custody and registration in their names. 15. The provisions of Section 174 of Income Tax Ordinance 2001, for present controversy is pari materia to Section 211 of the Act. The provisions of 174 of the Ordinance was discussed at length in Panther Sports specially in para-5. Since the two provisions are pari materia therefore by applying doctrine of statutory construction there cannot be a different interpretation of section 211 of Customs Act than the one given in the said judgment for section 174 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001. 16. So in cases of registered vehicles, if at the time the vehicle being intercepted, more than 3 years have elapsed for cases prior to the Finance Act, 2007 and 5 years for cases thereafter, the defence of lawful excuse appears to be indefeasible. This is also because it is reasonable to assume that if a vehicle stands registered, the government is presumed to have exercised due care and diligence with respect to its obligation to see whatever duties and taxes as payable to the government before a vehicle can be registered, stand paid. It must also be noted that the vehicles being registered, which registration was duly verified, is presumed to have been brought lawfully; after completion of notified period in case of used vehicles also. It seems harsh, to say the least, if without any proof that a person last owner was involved in the registration of the vehicle knowing fully well that no duties and taxes, as required under the law, were paid, and that therefore the vehicle was fraudulently registered, the vehicle be seized from him on his failure to produce documents of import and payment of duties and Civil Petition No. 288-P/2025 12 taxes thereon and even that beyond the period of three years or five years, as the case may be, as required under section 211 2 . In most of the cases since first registration, the vehicles changed many owners on the strength of registration book and no adverse inference could be drawn for the ultimate bonafide owners unless otherwise proved contrary by appellant, in which exercise the appellant department has failed below. The verified registration book and official record is enough for bonafide presumption that a valid title exist. 17. The Motor Vehicle Ordinance, 1965 provides the mechanism for registration of motor vehicles in terms of its sections from 23 to 43. Section 27 of ibid law even provides the production of the vehicle at the time of registration and if the registration of a vehicle passes through this statutory process conducted by officials responsible under M.V.O 1965, then presumption of truthfulness is eminent. 18. One must bear in mind that there is a distinction between the expression lawful authority contained in Section 187 and the expression lawful excuse contained in clause 89 of Section 156 1 . The distinction in both is reproduced as under: Section 187 Burden of proof as to lawful authority ete. When any person is alleged to have committed an offence under this Act and any question arises whether he did any act or was in possession of anything with lawful authority or under a permit, license or other document prescribed by or under any law for the time being in force, the burden of proving that he had such authority, permit, license or other document shall lie on him: Provided that any person, alleged to have committed an offence under this Act, shall bear the burden of proof that any property owned by him in his name or someone else name was not acquired from the proceeds of such crime: Provided further that the procedure for forfeiture of such property shall be prescribed by the Board under the rules. Clause 89 of Section 156 1 If any person without lawful excuse, the proof of which shall be on such person, acquires possession of, or is in any way concerned in carrying, removing, depositing, harbouring, keeping or concealing, retailing or in any manner dealing with smuggled goods or any goods in respect to which there may be reasonable suspicion that they are smuggled goods Civil Petition No. 288-P/2025 13 19. To apply Section 187 to clauses 89 and 90 of Section 156 would amount to limit or narrow down the scope of what is permissible under the said clauses of Section 156 of the Act as a defence; and that cannot be done. The legislature was conscious while using the two legal phrases which have different connotation. Section 187 in general deals with burden of proof as to lawful authority whereas Section 156 deals with punishment for offence. In this context, Section 187 can be regarded as a general provision whereas clauses 89 and 90 are specific provisions and in such a situation the specific provisions to the context must apply to the event/situation under discussion. As such, the accused persons are entitled only to demonstrate a lawful excuse to discharge themselves from the allegation under the said clauses even where the law is conceived to have been violated in respect of the goods i.e. the goods are smuggled goods in absence of import documents, and that is possible courtesy statutory period, disclosed in Section 211 followed by registration book through an official act under the law. A strong presumption is thus attached as a statutory act was performed in the registration of vehicle. 20. The distinction between lawful authority and lawful excuse was highlighted by the Privy Council in the judgment reported as PLD 1955 PC 29 by holding that the defence of lawful excuse may be sufficiently proved although no lawful authority exists for doing what is charged against the accused. Lawful excuse is an expression that is of wider import and lesser degree of burden than lawful authority. It follows from this that proving a lawful excuse, which falls short of lawful authority, it is the excuse put forward by the accused, rather than handling smuggled goods, that must be shown to be lawful. 21. Conceiving the events discussed in show-cause notices with above analysis as a common tool, it demonstrates that the vehicles in question are actually those which were registered through a statutory process and were duly verified and hence would carry lawful excuse. 22. This principle however is distinguished for the case where vehicles were found with tampered chassis and engine numbers. If this is seemingly done to match the statistics of original vehicles auctioned or brought into Pakistan officially having different chassis/engine number, the lawful excuse may not be applicable in case of tampered vehicle. This would not include those vehicles which were acquired via auction report explicitly disclosing such tampering and tampered statistics. Also at times the engine and chassis numbers are changed which are also excluded from any action, provided it was done with prior permission of the authority under the Motor Vehicles Ordinance, 1965. All this require thorough probe at the end to applicant which again is a question of fact not required to be determined by us afresh. 23. Learned counsel for the responded/department has mainly emphasized that a proper procedure was adopted while initiating confiscation and/or seizure process. Suffice to say that applying right procedure on wrong person and at the wrong time would not serve any purpose, rather is an abuse of process of law and such actions would be of no help for the department to take corrective measure to curb the smuggling. Such actions ought to have been taken at the time Civil Petition No. 288-P/ 2025 14 when vehicles were being registered. The appellants should workout some collaborated efforts before and at the time of registration of such vehicles so that this menace may come to an end. A proper joint effort in registration may be a way out. 24. Indeed, the respondents in order to achieve their lawful object of identifying the vehicles and subjected them to such exercise, the concerned directorate, on receipt of credible information of a suspected vehicle from authority concerned, including but not limited to Motor Registration Authority, may take requisite steps. In conducting such exercise a lady custom officer and a lady sepoy should also be aligned to ensure privacy and respect; legal requirement including search under section 162 of the Act be followed and inconvenience to the family must be avoided. 25. The conclusion in the above analysis is that the vehicles in question are those which were either auctioned or were brought into Pakistan and were registered through a statutory process and that the auction papers or registration papers of some other vehicles are not being used fraudulently, however, where it is established that the chassis/engine numbers have been tampered with after auction or registration to match the description of the auctioned or registered vehicle, the lawful excuse is not available. it The extensive reproduction of the judgment of the High Court of Sindh in the case reported as 2021 PTD 1683 and the judgment of the three-member bench of this Court in Civil Appeals No. 1088, 1231 to 1236/2013 and others dated 17.04.2025, whereby, the judgment of High Court of Sindh has been duly upheld, has been made to appreciate that the legal issues involved in the aforesaid cases and the questions of law arising from the impugned order passed by the Peshawar High Court, Peshawar in the instant matter have already been dealt with and answered through authoritative pronouncement by this Court in the aforesaid Civil Appeals, hence requires no further elaboration on the settled legal issues. Moreover, while confronted, the learned counsel for the petitioner could not point out any factual error or legal infirmity in the impugned order passed by the Peshawar High Court, Peshawar which may require this Court to interfere with such findings of facts and law or to take a different view which has already been taken by this Court in the above referred Civil Appeals. 12; Keeping in view the facts and the legal issues involved in the above reference application, we are of the opinion that legal issues and the questions of law relating to authority of the officials of the custom department to seize an imported vehicle, more than five years old plying on road, within territorial limits of the city, duly registered Civil Petition No. 288-P/2025 15 by the Motor Vehicle Registration Authority, in terms of Section 25 of the West Pakistan Motor Vehicle Ordinance, 1965, can be made if the importer/owner of such vehicle, fails to produce the import documents. Inspite of the fact that the importer/owner of such vehicle is under no legal obligation to keep such record of import beyond the period of five years in terms of Section 211 of the Act and further, the burden of proof in terms of Section 187 of the Act, stands discharged once the importer/owner produces the registration documents and shifts upon the Custom Authorities to prove otherwise by adopting the legal course, have already been decided in detail through an authoritative judgment by this Court in the above referred Civil Appeals. 13, Accordingly, while reformulating the questions proposed through instant civil petition for leave to appeal in terms of Para 8 herein above, we would answer the questions i and ii in NEGATIVE whereas the questions iii and iv are answered in AFFIRMATIVE against the applicants and in favour of the respondents. The instant petition for leave to appeal being devoid of any merits is hereby dismissed in the aforesaid terms. Islamabad, 23.04.2025. Approved for Reporting Tanveer Ahmed / Zainab Bashir, JLC.",

                "Whether the learned Member Technical , Appellate Tribunal, Bench-II, Karachi, while concluding the impugned judgment has seriously erred in law and failed to understand that in terms of subsection 2 of Section 156 and Section 187 of the Customs Act, 1969, the respondent/ possession holder of the vehicle has failed to Civil Petition No. 288-P/2025 5 8. discharge burden of proof of lawful possession?",
                "4, Whether registration of smuggled vehicle, having tampered chassis number with Motor Registration Authority Civic Centre, Karachi can regularize a smuggled vehicle and absolve it from penal action under the Customs Act, 1969?",
                "Whether importation and registration, in context of vehicles, are not different and distinct concepts, the former being under the Customs Act, 1969 and the latter being the Provincial subject and whether mere registration of vehicle absolves the owner/ possessor of a vehicle to prove its legal importation under the Customs Act, 1969?",
                "However, above proposed questions were reframed in the following terms: 9. i Whether a motor vehicle, duly registered with the Excise and Taxation Department under the Motor Vehicle Registration Ordinance, 1965, can be detained/seized by the Customs Authorities on the charges of smuggling in terms of Section 2 S read with Section 156 1 89 and 90 of the Customs Act, 1969, if the owner is not in possession of the import documents?",
                "ii Whether the Customs Authorities can ask for production of record including import documents from owner in respect of a Motor Vehicle or any other importable item, beyond the period of five years in terms of Section 211 of the Customs Act, 1969?",
                "iii Whether the Registration Book, Customs Auction Documents, Form of Transfer Order, Bank challans towards payments of additional duty and taxes, capital value tax CVT , registration fee transfer fee and other charges, unless proved to be bogus and forged, constitute other documents prescribed by or under any law for the time being in force in terms of Section 187 of the Customs Act, 1969?",
                "iv Whether production of documents as prescribed by or under any law for the time being in force by the owner in respect of a motor vehicle or any other importable item shifts the burden of proof from the owner, upon the Customs Authorities to establish the charge of smuggling through positive evidence or any concrete material to the contrary, in terms of Section 2 s read with Section 156 1 89 and 90 of Customs Act, 1969?",
                "Perusal of hereinabove questions shows that the controversy involved in the above mentioned case is identical to questions involved in the instant case, therefore, the decision on the aforesaid questions has a direct bearing on the legal issues involved in the instant case, hence the relevant findings on the said issues are reproduced as under: 7.",
                "We have reproduced the relevant facts, questions proposed and the findings recorded thereon by the Divisional Bench of this Court in the aforesaid reference application at length, as we are of the view that the facts and legal issues involved in all these cases are similar to the facts and legal issues of the above cited case, and, Civil Petition No. 288-P/2025 6 therefore, would be relevant to decide the questions of law and legal points involved in these reference applications and the connected petitions as well as High Court Appeal.",
                "As we have already observed that in none of these cases, there is any allegation against the owners/subsequent purchases for having committed an act of smuggling in terms of Section 2 s of the Customs Act, 1969, as neither they have imported subject vehicles nor they have brought such vehicles into Pakistan from routes other than specified under Section 9 or 10 from any place other than a Customs Station, nor any evidence or material has been produced by the Customs Authorities, which could otherwise establish that documents produced, e.g.",
                "Registration Books issued by Excise and Taxation Department, Motor Vehicle Registration Authority, Government of Sindh, Form of Transfer Order, the sale/purchase agreements, the Custom Auction documents, Bank Challans towards payment of Additional Customs duty and taxes, CVT, registration fee, transfer fee and other charges etc., produced in respect of subject vehicles, are forged or bogus documents.",
                "Admittedly, all the owners of the subject vehicles in these cases are second, third or even fifth owners, and have supplied the above documents which, prima-facie, show that initial burden of proof to the effect that they are the bona fide lawful owners/purchasers of the subject vehicles and have not committed any act of smuggling nor they are in possession of smuggled vehicles.",
                "The subject vehicles do not fall within the category of banned items as defined in Appendix-A of the Import Policy Order, 2009, 2012, and 2016, however, their import is subject to certain conditions prescribed by the Federal Government through Notifications issued in terms of Section 2 s ti read with section 156 2 of the Customs Act, 1969, Import Policy Orders, 2009, 2012, 2013 and 2016, which includes restriction of five years as to the age of manufacture of a vehicle to be imported.",
                "In fact none of the Motors Vehicles, subject matter of instant cases, is less than 5 years old rather, they are mostly old Models of 1998 to 2004, therefore, reference to provisions of Section 211 of the Customs Act, 1969, becomes relevant as it provides that record required under subsection i of Section 211 of the Customs Act, 1969, in respect of any imported item shall be kept for a period of not less than five years in such form as the Board may by Notification in the official gazette, specify.",
                "In other words, any importer or owner of the imported items is under no legal obligation to maintain any record pertaining to import beyond the period of five years under the Customs Act, 1969, nor the Customs Authorities can demand such record under the Customs Act, 1969, hence nonavailability of customs documents, older than five years, particularly in cases of Registered Motor Vehicles, would not attract the provisions of Section 2 s read with Section 156 1 89 and 90 of the Customs Act, 1969.",
                "We would now examine the provisions of Section 187 of the Customs Act, 1969, relating to discharge of burden of proof, according to which, when any person alleged to have committed an offence under this Act, and any question arises whether he did any act or was in possession of anything with lawful authority or under a permit, license or other document prescribed by or under any law for the time being in force, the burden of proving that he had such authority, permit, license or other Civil Petition No. 288-P/2025 i document shall be upon such person.",
                "In all the above references and the petitions, it has been noted that original Registration Book issued by Motor Vehicle Registration Authority in respect of subject vehicles, along with Customs Auction documents, Bank Challans towards payment of Additional duty and taxes.",
                "Form of Transfer Order, Capital Value Tax CVT , Registration Fee and other charges were produced before the Customs Authorities to justify the lawful ownership/possession towards discharge of initial burden of proof in terms of Section 187 of the Customs Act, 1969.",
                "In the afore cited judgment, the learned Divisional Bench of this Court has elaborately dilated upon all the above legal issues related to discharge of burden of proof and has been pleased to hold that in terms of Section 187 of the Customs Act, 1969, once the initial burden relating to ownership and lawful possession of the imported vehicle has been discharged through production of original Registration Book issued by the Motor Vehicle Registration Authority or any other document prescribed by law or under any other law for the time being in force, then burden shifts upon the Customs Authorities to establish that either the Documents produced are forged, bogus or the same have been obtained illegally, hence of no legal consequences.",
                "However, in these cases, no proceedings, whatsoever, appear to have been initiated either against the previous owners of the subject vehicles, whose particulars have been provided by the respondents to the Customs Authorities to verify the mode and manner in which such vehicles were brought into Pakistan, nor any action against the officials of the Motor Vehicle Registration Authority.",
                "Customs Authorities and the Bank officials has been taken, for having issued the Registration Books, Custom Auction documents and Bank paid challans which, according to Customs Authorities are forged and bogus documents.",
                "On the contrary, in the absence of any material, inquiry/investigation or any steps required to be undertaken for establishing the charge of smuggling in terms of Section 2 s , or to make out a case that owners of the vehicles are found in possession of smuggled vehicles in terms of Sections 156 1 , 89 and 90 of the Customs Act, 1969, and even without following the legal course of adjudication as provided under Chapter XIX of the Customs Act, 1969, subject vehicles have been detained/seized on the charges of smuggling.",
                "In all these cases, subject vehicles have been detained / confiscated by the Customs Authorities in a highly arbitrary manner while the same were plying within the territorial city limits, inspite of the fact that initial burden to prove the lawful ownership and possession of subject Registered Vehicles was discharged by the owners through production of aforesaid documents.",

                "Learned counsel for the applicant has not been Civil Petition No. 288-P/2025 8 able to point out any factual error or illegality in the impugned order passed by the Customs Appellate Tribunal in the instant case, nor could assist this Court as to how, on the basis of a purported certificate obtained from local manufacturer of Hino Pak Truck, the age of imported Hino Truck can be ascertained.",
                "record shows that respondent has discharged the initial burden to prove that the subject vehicles were imported in conformity with paragraph 9Q ii 5 of the Import Policy Order, 2016, whereas, applicant has failed to produce any evidence or material which could otherwise support the allegations of violation of para 9ii 5 of the Import Policy Order, 2016.",

                "The consequence of this provision appears to be that if the auction of the vehicle took place more than 3 years ago for cases prior to the Finance Act, 2007 and 5 years for cases thereafter, there would appear to be a lawful excuse to the person retaining the possession of vehicle under valid registration , who is accused of an offence under Section 156 89 or 90 for not showing required import documents , unless it can be demonstrated that he was told or knew that duties and taxes were not paid and the same were required to be paid.",
                "For auctioned vehicles such as in SCRA No. 263 of 2010 Civil Appeal No.1235 of 2013 , the vehicle in question was auctioned on or about 25.11.1999, having registration No.BD-0689 dated 24.06.2005 and was intercepted on or about 09.10.2008.",
                "In these circumstances, Section 211 2 seems to provide a lawful excuse since no adverse inference for failure to produce the documents can be drawn after the lapse of period provided in Section 211 2 to be counted at-least from date of registration if not before, as auction date in other vehicles is also a legitimate claim to count time.",
                "The vehicle in question was in Pakistan on or about 25.11.1999, ie.",
                "the date of auction, and the said period expired before the vehicle was intercepted on or about 09.10.2008.",
                "There does not appear to be anything on the record to suggest that as per the terms of the auction, the auction purchaser had to pay duties and taxes applicable in respect of the import of the auctioned vehicle.",

                "So in cases of registered vehicles, if at the time the vehicle being intercepted, more than 3 years have elapsed for cases prior to the Finance Act, 2007 and 5 years for cases thereafter, the defence of lawful excuse appears to be indefeasible.",
                "This is also because it is reasonable to assume that if a vehicle stands registered, the government is presumed to have exercised due care and diligence with respect to its obligation to see whatever duties and taxes as payable to the government before a vehicle can be registered, stand paid.",
                "It must also be noted that the vehicles being registered, which registration was duly verified, is presumed to have been brought lawfully; after completion of notified period in case of used vehicles also.",
                "It seems harsh, to say the least, if without any proof that a person last owner was involved in the registration of the vehicle knowing fully well that no duties and taxes, as required under the law, were paid, and that therefore the vehicle was fraudulently registered, the vehicle be seized from him on his failure to produce documents of import and payment of duties and Civil Petition No. 288-P/2025 12 taxes thereon and even that beyond the period of three years or five years, as the case may be, as required under section 211 2 .",
                "In most of the cases since first registration, the vehicles changed many owners on the strength of registration book and no adverse inference could be drawn for the ultimate bonafide owners unless otherwise proved contrary by appellant, in which exercise the appellant department has failed below.",
                "The verified registration book and official record is enough for bonafide presumption that a valid title exist.",

                "One must bear in mind that there is a distinction between the expression lawful authority contained in Section 187 and the expression lawful excuse contained in clause 89 of Section 156 1 .",
                "The distinction in both is reproduced as under: Section 187 Burden of proof as to lawful authority ete.",

                "To apply Section 187 to clauses 89 and 90 of Section 156 would amount to limit or narrow down the scope of what is permissible under the said clauses of Section 156 of the Act as a defence; and that cannot be done.",
                "The legislature was conscious while using the two legal phrases which have different connotation.",
                "Section 187 in general deals with burden of proof as to lawful authority whereas Section 156 deals with punishment for offence.",
                "In this context, Section 187 can be regarded as a general provision whereas clauses 89 and 90 are specific provisions and in such a situation the specific provisions to the context must apply to the event/situation under discussion.",
                "As such, the accused persons are entitled only to demonstrate a lawful excuse to discharge themselves from the allegation under the said clauses even where the law is conceived to have been violated in respect of the goods i.e.",
                "the goods are smuggled goods in absence of import documents, and that is possible courtesy statutory period, disclosed in Section 211 followed by registration book through an official act under the law.",
                "A strong presumption is thus attached as a statutory act was performed in the registration of vehicle.",
                "The distinction between lawful authority and lawful excuse was highlighted by the Privy Council in the judgment reported as PLD 1955 PC 29 by holding that the defence of lawful excuse may be sufficiently proved although no lawful authority exists for doing what is charged against the accused.",
                "Lawful excuse is an expression that is of wider import and lesser degree of burden than lawful authority.",
                "It follows from this that proving a lawful excuse, which falls short of lawful authority, it is the excuse put forward by the accused, rather than handling smuggled goods, that must be shown to be lawful.",
                "Conceiving the events discussed in show-cause notices with above analysis as a common tool, it demonstrates that the vehicles in question are actually those which were registered through a statutory process and were duly verified and hence would carry lawful excuse.",
                "This principle however is distinguished for the case where vehicles were found with tampered chassis and engine numbers.",
                "If this is seemingly done to match the statistics of original vehicles auctioned or brought into Pakistan officially having different chassis/engine number, the lawful excuse may not be applicable in case of tampered vehicle.",
                "This would not include those vehicles which were acquired via auction report explicitly disclosing such tampering and tampered statistics.",
                "Also at times the engine and chassis numbers are changed which are also excluded from any action, provided it was done with prior permission of the authority under the Motor Vehicles Ordinance, 1965.",
                "All this require thorough probe at the end to applicant which again is a question of fact not required to be determined by us afresh.",
                "Learned counsel for the responded/department has mainly emphasized that a proper procedure was adopted while initiating confiscation and/or seizure process.",
                "Suffice to say that applying right procedure on wrong person and at the wrong time would not serve any purpose, rather is an abuse of process of law and such actions would be of no help for the department to take corrective measure to curb the smuggling.",
                "Such actions ought to have been taken at the time Civil Petition No. 288-P/ 2025 14 when vehicles were being registered.",
                "The appellants should workout some collaborated efforts before and at the time of registration of such vehicles so that this menace may come to an end.",
                "A proper joint effort in registration may be a way out.",
                "Indeed, the respondents in order to achieve their lawful object of identifying the vehicles and subjected them to such exercise, the concerned directorate, on receipt of credible information of a suspected vehicle from authority concerned, including but not limited to Motor Registration Authority, may take requisite steps.",
                "In conducting such exercise a lady custom officer and a lady sepoy should also be aligned to ensure privacy and respect; legal requirement including search under section 162 of the Act be followed and inconvenience to the family must be avoided.",
                "The conclusion in the above analysis is that the vehicles in question are those which were either auctioned or were brought into Pakistan and were registered through a statutory process and that the auction papers or registration papers of some other vehicles are not being used fraudulently, however, where it is established that the chassis/engine numbers have been tampered with after auction or registration to match the description of the auctioned or registered vehicle, the lawful excuse is not available.",
                "it The extensive reproduction of the judgment of the High Court of Sindh in the case reported as 2021 PTD 1683 and the judgment of the three-member bench of this Court in Civil Appeals No. 1088, 1231 to 1236/2013 and others dated 17.04.2025, whereby, the judgment of High Court of Sindh has been duly upheld, has been made to appreciate that the legal issues involved in the aforesaid cases and the questions of law arising from the impugned order passed by the Peshawar High Court, Peshawar in the instant matter have already been dealt with and answered through authoritative pronouncement by this Court in the aforesaid Civil Appeals, hence requires no further elaboration on the settled legal issues.",

No.1518/2023).\n\nDirector, Directorate General, Intelligence\n& Investigation (Customs)\n\n...Petitioner\nVersus\nAltaf Hussain & another\n...Respondents\nFor the Petitioner: Dr. Farhat Zafar, ASC (at Islamabad)\nMr. Imran Afzal, Addl: Dir (via video link\n(Karachi).\n\nFor the Respondents: Not represented.\nDate of Hearing: 29.05.2025\nORDER\n\nMUNIB AKHTAR, J.- With the assistance of learned counsel for\nthe petitioner we have gone through the impugned order of the\nlearned High Court and also seen the last order made by this\nCourt. Since then, the decision of the Larger Bench of this Court\nhas been announced, which upholds the principles laid down in\nthe case of Collector of Sales Tax, Gujranwala and others v Messrs\nSuper Asia Mohammad Din and Sons and others 2017 SCMR 1427\n(“Super Asia’). Learned counsel for the petitioner seeks to place\nreliance on paragraphs 11 and 12 of the said judgment. These\ndealt with s. 74 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 (“1990 Act”), and\nconsidered the possibility of the grant of an extension of time in\nterms thereof. Section 74 was held to apply in terms as stated in\npara 12 of the judgment in Super Asia. Learned counsel submits\nthat in this case an extension of time was granted by the Federal\nBoard of Revenue (“Board”) and therefore the impugned decision is\n\nnot sustainable.\n\nC.P.L.A.466-K of 2025 2:\n\n2. We have considered this point. Firstly, this matter has arisen\nunder the Customs Act, 1969 and the relevant statutory power\nwhich is claimed was exercised by the Board was conferred by\n\nsubsection (4) of s. 179 of the said Act, which is reproduced below:\n\n“The Board shall have the powers to regulate the system of\nadjudication including transfer of cases and extension of time-\nlimit in exceptional circumstances.”\n\nAs is obvious from a perusal of the said provision the power\nto grant an extension is circumscribed, and is to be exercised only\nin “exceptional circumstances”. Section 74 of the 1990 Act on the\nother hand provides that the Board is empowered to grant an\nextension to the extent found “appropriate”. There is an obvious\nand clear difference between the two provisions and, as here\nrelevant, the power under s. 179(4) is much narrower and\ncircumscribed. Therefore, the paragraphs of Super Asia sought to\nbe relied upon by learned counsel for the petitioner, with respect,\nhave no relevance. Furthermore, we may also note that the Larger\nBench has also made some observations with regard to s. 74 of the\n\n1990 Act.\n\n3. Secondly, it must also be noted that on a query from the\nCourt learned counsel for the petitioner has candidly (and quite\nproperly) stated that the permission/letter of extension that was\ngranted by the Board was not placed on the record before the\nAppellate Tribunal. Indeed, this was specifically noted by the\nlearned Tribunal in its order as follows: “However, the plea taken\nby the respondents is that they have taken approval from FBR as\nmentioned in section 179(4) but no such approval was placed\n\nbefore the Honourable Tribunal”.\n\n4. This matter comes to this Court from a tax reference and it\nis well established that beyond the stage of the Appellate Tribunal\n(at any rate, in terms of the law as it stood at the relevant time), it\nis only questions of law that can be taken to the High Court. It is\nwell settled that (again with reference to the law as it stood at the\n\nrelevant time) the record on the basis of which the questions of law\n\nC.P.L.A.466-K of 2025 23s\n\ncan be decided is in terms of the record as it stood before the\nAppellate Tribunal. That record cannot be added to and certainly\nnot on a point that requires factual determination (here, the\nexistence and content of any extension granted by the Board).\nSince the position is that the aforesaid letter by which it is claimed\nextension of time was granted by the Board was never placed on\nthe record before the Appellate Tribunal, it is impermissible for any\nreliance to be placed on the same in this Court (or indeed, for that\nmatter, before the learned High Court). The settled position being\nwhat it is we are, with respect, not inclined to entertain the point\nnow being taken. Any departure from the well settled position\nwould allow a party to a tax reference to alter the record either\nbefore the High Court or this Court which is not permissible.\nAccordingly, the contention of learned counsel for the petitioner,\nwith respect, cannot be accepted.

Since then, the decision of the Larger Bench of this Court has been announced, which upholds the principles laid down in the case of Collector of Sales Tax, Gujranwala and others v Messrs Super Asia Mohammad Din and Sons and others 2017 SCMR 1427 Super Asia . Learned counsel for the petitioner seeks to place reliance on paragraphs 11 and 12 of the said judgment. These dealt with s. 74 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 1990 Act , and considered the possibility of the grant of an extension of time in terms thereof. Section 74 was held to apply in terms as stated in para 12 of the judgment in Super Asia. Learned counsel submits that in this case an extension of time was granted by the Federal Board of Revenue Board and therefore the impugned decision is not sustainable. C.P.L.A.466-K of 2025 2: 2. We have considered this point. Firstly, this matter has arisen under the Customs Act, 1969 and the relevant statutory power which is claimed was exercised by the Board was conferred by subsection 4 of s. 179 of the said Act, which is reproduced below: The Board shall have the powers to regulate the system of adjudication including transfer of cases and extension of timelimit in exceptional circumstances. As is obvious from a perusal of the said provision the power to grant an extension is circumscribed, and is to be exercised only in exceptional circumstances . Section 74 of the 1990 Act on the other hand provides that the Board is empowered to grant an extension to the extent found appropriate . There is an obvious and clear difference between the two provisions and, as here relevant, the power under s. 179 4 is much narrower and circumscribed. Therefore, the paragraphs of Super Asia sought to be relied upon by learned counsel for the petitioner, with respect, have no relevance. Furthermore, we may also note that the Larger Bench has also made some observations with regard to s. 74 of the 1990 Act. 3. Secondly, it must also be noted that on a query from the Court learned counsel for the petitioner has candidly and quite properly stated that the permission/letter of extension that was granted by the Board was not placed on the record before the Appellate Tribunal. Indeed, this was specifically noted by the learned Tribunal in its order as follows: However, the plea taken by the respondents is that they have taken approval from FBR as mentioned in section 179 4 but no such approval was placed before the Honourable Tribunal . 4. This matter comes to this Court from a tax reference and it is well established that beyond the stage of the Appellate Tribunal at any rate, in terms of the law as it stood at the relevant time , it is only questions of law that can be taken to the High Court. It is well settled that again with reference to the law as it stood at the relevant time the record on the basis of which the questions of law C.P.L.A.466-K of 2025 23s can be decided is in terms of the record as it stood before the Appellate Tribunal. That record cannot be added to and certainly not on a point that requires factual determination here, the existence and content of any extension granted by the Board . Since the position is that the aforesaid letter by which it is claimed extension of time was granted by the Board was never placed on the record before the Appellate Tribunal, it is impermissible for any reliance to be placed on the same in this Court or indeed, for that matter, before the learned High Court . The settled position being what it is we are, with respect, not inclined to entertain the point now being taken. Any departure from the well settled position would allow a party to a tax reference to alter the record either before the High Court or this Court which is not permissible. Accordingly, the contention of learned counsel for the petitioner, with respect, cannot be accepted. This petition fails and is accordingly dismissed.

Appellant\nVersus\nUzma Tehreem & others .... Respondents\nFor the Appellant : Mr. Salman Aslam Butt, Sr. ASC\nSyed Rifaqat Hussain Shah, AOR\nFor the Respondent : Mr. Muhammad Imran Malik, ASC\nNos. 1 to 4\nFor the Respondent : Nemo\nNos. 5 &6\nDate of Hearing >: 23.04.2025\nJUDGMENT\n\nNaeem Akhter Afghan, J. Respondent Nos. 1, 2 & 3 are the Directors of\n\nrespondent No. 4 [Tanveer Weavings (Private) Limited]. In January 2004\nRespondent No.4 through respondent Nos. 2 & 3 approached Pakistan\nIndustrial Credit and Investment Corporation Commercial Bank Limited\n(PICIC Commercial Bank) for grant of a short-term finance facility for the\npurpose of meeting its capital requirements. In all the relevant documents,\ndeeds, Sanction Letters and Agreements with the Banks, the respondent\nNo. 4 has been mentioned as “the Customer”. Respondent No.2, being one\nof the Directors and authorized agent, is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO)\n\nof respondent No. 4.\n\n2. After complying with all due formalities/requirements, Running\nFinance (RF) facility for the sum of Rs.50,000,000/- (Rupees Fifty Million)\nfor one year and another facility of Rs.19 million was sanctioned on 29th\nJanuary 2004 for respondent No. 4 and in this regard Finance Facility\nAgreement dated 31st January 2004 was executed between the parties. The\nparties also executed a Finance Facility Agreement on markup basis in the\nsum of Rs.19,000,000/- (Rupees Nineteen Million). The respondent Nos. 2\n& 3 furnished securities by hypothecation of moveable properties,\n\nhypothecation of receivables, creation of equitable mortgages and execution\n\nCA No. 164 of 2025 2\n\nof irrevocable power of attorney in respect of different properties.\nRespondent No.2 also submitted continuing Personal Guarantee vide Letter\n\nof Guarantee dated 31st January 2004.\n\n3. In October 2004, on the request of respondent No.2, the RF facility of\nRs.50 million was enhanced to Rs.70 million for respondent No. 4 for a\nlimited period and in this regard Running Finance Enhancement Sanction\nwas also made on the basis of terms and conditions agreed by respondent\n\nNo.2.\n\n4. The RF facility (as enhanced) expired in the year 2005. By that time\nthe other facility (of Rs.19 million) was discharged however default was\nmade in making repayment of the Principal, markup and other amounts\ndue in respect of RF facility of Rs.70 million. Respondent Nos. 2, 3 & 4\nrequested for renewal of the Enhanced RF facility which was accepted by\nthe PICIC Commercial Bank vide 224 Sanction Letter whereafter renewed\nRunning Finance Agreement dated 12» may 2005 was executed and RF\nfacility of Rs.70 million on markup basis was renewed for period of one year.\nSupplementary letter of hypothecation of moveable properties and\nsupplementary letter of hypothecation of receivables, memorandum of\ndeposit of title deeds, and continuing Guarantee were furnished by\n\nrespondent No.2.\n\n5. Despite continuous default in making repayments of the Principal,\nmarkup and other amounts due in respect of the renewed RF facility, in\nOctober 2005, the respondent No.2 sought further enhancement in the\n\nexisting credit package which was not materialized.\n\n6. On 18th April 2006, while acknowledging the liabilities, respondent\nNo.2 sought indulgence by the PICIC Commercial Bank for release of one of\nthe mortgaged properties for clearing the outstanding dues. On the basis of\nassurance/commitment by respondent No.2 for payment of the obligations,\nthe PICIC Commercial Bank released one of the mortgaged properties i.e.\n\nPlot No.400/D-11 & II, Peoples Colony, Faisalabad.\n\n7. On expiry of renewed RF facility and due to continuous and willful\ndefault in repayment of the Principal, markup and other amounts,\nrespondent No.2, while admitting the liability, requested the PICIC\nCommercial Bank to rollover/renew the RF facility. The request of\nrespondent No.2 was accepted and 34 sanction letter dated 24th February\n2007 was issued by the PICIC Commercial bank whereby the RF facility in\n\nthe sum of Rs.70 million was further renewed. Respondent Nos.1, 2 & 3\n\nCA No. 164 of 2025 3\n\nexecuted the 2™¢ renewed RF agreement with PICIC Commercial Bank.\nApart from furnishing the requisite securities for due performance of\nobligations under the 2\"4 renewed RF agreement, the respondent Nos. 1, 2\n& 3 executed continuing Guarantees in favour of PICIC Commercial Bank\n\nvide Separate letters of Guarantee dated 24th February 2007.\n\nNote: The continuing letter of Guarantee dated 24'” February 2007 duly\nsigned and executed by respondent No.1, being relevant for decision of the\n\ninstant appeal, is available at page 375 to 378 of paper book (Part-Ill).\n\n8. Pursuant to Amalgamation Scheme duly sanctioned by the State\nBank of Pakistan on 31st December 2007, the NIB Bank Limited (NIB Bank)\nstood amalgamated/merged with PICIC Commercial Bank and Pakistan\nIndustrial Credit and Investment Corporation Limited (PICIC). The entire\nundertaking of PICIC Commercial Bank and PICIC including all properties,\nassets, liabilities and all rights and obligations of PICIC Commercial Bank\nand PICIC stood amalgamated with and vested into the NIB Bank.\n\n9. In December 2007 partial payment of outstanding markup was made\nin pursuance of 2\"4 renewed RF facility. Keeping in view the expiry of 274\nrenewed RF facility, respondent No.2 approached NIB Bank with request for\nfurther renewal of RF facility for another term with undertaking for\nappropriate utilization of the funds for respondent No.4. The request so\nmade by respondent No.2 was accepted by the Board of Directors of NIB\nBank in pursuance whereof 4th sanction letter and 3'4 renewed RF facility\nwas sanctioned for respondent No.4 in the sum of Rs.70 million subject to\nfurnishing securities and execution of 3 renewed RF agreement.\nRespondent Nos. 1, 2 & 3 executed the 3™4 renewed RF agreement dated 24\nJanuary 2008 with NIB Bank on the same terms as of the 2™4 renewed RF\nagreement. The respondent Nos.1, 2 & 3 also executed a promissory note\ndated 24 January 2008 as a continuing security for payment of the ultimate\nbalance in pursuance of 3'4 renewed RF agreement dated 2™4 January 2008\n\nwhich is available at page 386 of the paper book (Part-III).\n\n10. The respondent Nos. 1 to 4 continued willful default and made only\npartial payments in pursuance of 3'¢ renewed RF facility. On expiry of 34\nrenewed RF facility, while acknowledging and admitting the obligations for\nrepayment under the 3\"¢ renewed RF facility, the NIB Bank was approached\nby respondent No.2 on behalf of respondent No. 4 with request to\nconvert/restructure the outstanding renewed RF facility into a long term\n\nfacility. The Board of Directors of NIB Bank accepted the request and vide\n\nCA No. 164 of 2025 4\n\nRestructuring Sanction Letter dated 15 June 2009, the NIB Bank\nsanctioned the conversion/restructuring of the 3™ renewed RF facility into\na Term Loan (TL) facility for respondent No. 4 subject to execution of\n\nRestructuring Agreement which was executed on 15th June 2009.\n\n11. In partial fulfilment of obligations under the TL facility an amount of\nRs.5 lakhs was paid on 22™4 December 2009 but the minimum monthly\npayments due from 15th July 2009 till 15» November 2009 were not made\nby respondent Nos. 1 to 4 despite availing opportunities. The NIB Bank, left\nwith no other option, filed suit against respondent Nos.1 to 4 in October\n2013 before Lahore High Court (LHC) under section 9 of the Financial\nInstitutions (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance, 2001 (Ordinance of 2001)\nread with all relevant and other enabling provisions of law for recovery of\nRs.108,516,398.30/- (Rupees One Hundred and Eight Million five Hundred\nand Sixteen Thousand Three Hundred and Ninety eight and thirty Paisas\nonly) as on 25 February 2013 alongwith cost of funds through sale of\n\nmortgaged and charged properties.\n\n12. In the suit the NIB Bank also arrayed Bank Alfalah Limited, Muslim\nCommercial Bank (MCB) Limited and Askari Commercial Bank Limited as\ndefendant Nos. 5, 6 & 7 respectively on the ground that Bank Alfalah\nLimited holds a pari passu charge alongwith the NIB Bank over the current\nassets of respondent No. 4 and MCB Limited as well as Askari Commercial\nBank Limited also have charges over the moveable and immovable assets of\n\nrespondent No.4.\n\n13. Respondent Nos. 1 to 4 submitted a joint application on 29th\nNovember 2013 under section 10 of the Ordinance of 2001, in the form of\nwritten statement, for grant of unconditional leave to defend the suit and\n\nrecording evidence while denying the liabilities claimed by the NIB Bank.\n\n14. Being plaintiff, the NIB Bank submitted replication dated 8t May\n2014 to the application/written statement of respondent Nos. 1 to 4.\n\n15. While dismissing the application of respondent Nos.1 to 4 for leave to\ndefend the suit, the suit filed by the NIB Bank was decreed by the learned\nSingle Bench (SB) of LHC vide judgment and decree dated 14th April 2017\nin the sum of Rs.108,516,398.30/- together with costs of funds as\ncontemplated by section 3 of the Ordinance of 2001 and with costs of the\nsuit on the ground that respondent Nos. 1 to 4 had failed to raise any\n\ndispute on facts requiring its determination through recording of evidence.\n\nCA No. 164 of 2025 5\n\n16. Feeling aggrieved of the judgment and decree dated 14» April 2017\npassed by the learned SB of LHC, respondent Nos. 1 to 4 filed RFA No.\n116017/2017 against NIB Bank and others before the learned Division\nBench (DB) of LHC.\n\n17. RFA was dismissed by the learned DB of LHC vide judgment and\ndecree dated 13th January 2025 to the extent of respondent Nos. 2 to 4,\nhowever, the same was partly accepted to the extent of respondent No.1 and\nby overruling the objection of the appellant about the RFA being barred by\ntime, the Respondent No.1 was granted leave to defend the suit on the basis\nof the contention of learned counsel that the respondent No.1 did not\nfurnish fresh Guarantee in pursuance of the Restructuring Agreement\ndated 15th June 2009 and on the ground that substantial question of law\nand fact to the extent of respondent No.1 has been raised by the learned\n\ncounsel which requires recording of evidence.\n\n18. Feeling aggrieved of the judgment and decree dated 13 January\n2025 passed by learned DB of LHC in favour of respondent No.1, the MCB\nLimited has filed the instant Appeal as in pursuance of order dated 13th\nJune 2017 passed by State Bank of Pakistan, NIB Bank stood merged with\nand amalgamated into MCB Limited. The MCB Limited is the successor in\ninterest of NIB Bank in respect of its all assets, liabilities, rights and\n\nobligations.\n\n19. Learned counsel for the appellant contended that while partly\naccepting the appeal to the extent of respondent No.1, the learned DB of\nLHC has failed to appreciate that respondent No. 1 and respondent Nos. 2\nto 4 had jointly filed appeal against the judgment and decree dated 14th\nApril 2017 passed by SB of LHC on 9th June 2017 without affixing the\nrequisite court fee on the memo of appeal; office objection was raised and\nthree days time was afforded to respondent Nos. 1 to 4 for compliance of\nthe office objection but memo of appeal was refiled by respondent Nos. 1 to\n4 by affixing the requisite court fee on 4 December 2017 and as such the\nappeal of respondent Nos. 1 to 4 was time barred by 173 days. While\nreferring to the case of Siddique Khan v. Abdul Shakur Khan!, learned\ncounsel contended that the conduct of respondent Nos. 1 to 4 was\ncontumacious and as such RFA, being time barred, was liable to be\n\ndismissed by the learned DB of LHC.\n\n* PLD 1984 SC 289\n\nCA No. 164 of 2025 6\n\nAccording to learned counsel, the objection of time barred appeal filed by\nrespondent Nos. 1 to 4 before the learned DB of LHC has not been dealt\nwith by the learned DB of LHC in accordance with the settled principles of\n\nlaw.\n\n20. Learned counsel for the appellant further contended that the\nRestructuring Agreement dated 15th June 2009 was signed by the three\nDirectors of respondent No.4 including respondent No.1 and _ the\nGuarantees of all the Directors of respondent No.4 i.e. respondent Nos.1, 2\n& 3 were continuing/subsisting; there exists no substantial question of\nfacts or law requiring evidence to be recorded; there was no occasion for the\n\nlearned DB of LHC to grant respondent No.1 leave to defend the suit.\n\n21. Learned counsel for respondent Nos. 1 & 4 contended that the appeal\nfiled by respondent Nos. 1 to 4 before the learned DB of LHC has rightly\nbeen entertained/partly accepted to the extent of respondent No.1 as the\noffice objection was vague and not specific; the conduct of the respondent\nNos.1 to 4 was not contumacious as in compliance of office objection, the\n\nrequisite court fee was affixed while refiling the appeal.\n\nLearned counsel for respondent Nos. 1 to 4 further contended that the\nrespondent No. 1 did not furnish any fresh Guarantee in pursuance of\nRestructuring Agreement dated 15th June 2009; the Guarantee furnished\nby respondent No. 1 in pursuance of 2\"4 renewed RF agreement of year 2007\nstood discharged under section 133 of the Contract Act 1872 (Contract Act)\ndue to variance in terms of the contract by execution of Restructuring\nAgreement dated 15tt June 2009 i.e.; the grant of leave to respondent No.1\nfor defending the suit by the learned DB of LHC in the above circumstances\n\nis not suffering from any illegality.\n\n22. In rebuttal, learned counsel for the appellant contended that the\nGuarantee furnished by respondent No.1 in pursuance of 2\"4 renewed RF\nagreement of year 2007 is continuing; the same was never revoked by\nrespondent No.1; moreover, the respondent No. 1 had also signed the\nRestructuring Agreement dated 15 June 2009 as a Guarantor due to\nwhich section 133 of the Contract Act 1872 is not attracted and in this\nregard learned counsel referred the case of Aftab A. Sheikh v. Trust\n\nLeasing Corporation Limited?2.\n\n23. After hearing learned counsel for the parties, we have perused the\n\navailable record which reveals that respondent Nos.1 to 4 filed appeal\n\n2 2003 CLD 702\n\nCA No. 164 of 2025 7\n\nagainst the judgment and decree dated 14‘ April 2017 passed by learned\nSB of LHC on 9'+ June 2017 without affixing the requisite court fee on the\nmemo of appeal. The office objection proforma of LHC is available at page 3\nof CMA No.1535/2025. At the bottom of said proforma, at Serial No.27, the\noffice of LHC had raised objection on 9tt June 2017 on the appeal of\nrespondent Nos. 1 to 4 in the words “incomplete”. In the end of the\nproforma, it has been written as follows:\n\n“Return with objections at Sr. Nos.\nTo be re-submitted after removal of these objection(s) within\n03 three day(s) subject to limitation.”\n\n24. It has specifically been mentioned in the office objection proforma that\nthe office objections have to be removed/complied with within three days\nsubject to limitation. It was very much in the knowledge of respondent Nos.\n1 to 4 and their counsel that the appeal is incomplete due to non-affixation\nof the requisite court fee. Neither the requisite court fee was filed within\nthree days of the office objection nor any application was filed before the\ncourt for extending time to affix the requisite court fee on the memo of\nappeal. The appeal was refiled by respondent Nos. 1 to 4 with requisite court\nfee on 4th December 2017 i.e. after delay of 173 days whereas under sub-\nsection 1 of section 22 of the Ordinance of 2001 it was to be filed within\nthirty days. The same was not accompanied with any application for\n\ncondonation of delay in filing the appeal.\n\nThe above portrays that the conduct of respondent Nos. 1 to 4 was\n\ncontumacious.\n\n25. According to the settled principles, if the objections raised by the\noffice are not removed during the period allowed by the office and in the\nmeanwhile the limitation period expires and the conduct of the appellant is\nconsidered to be contumacious, the appeal has to be rejected being time\nbarred. Reliance in this regard is placed on the cases of “Siddique Khan”\n(referred by learned counsel for the appellant), Asad Ali v. Bank of Punjab°,\nController Land Acquisition v. Fazal-ur-Rehman* and Lahore\n\nDevelopment Authority v. Muhammad Rashid*\n\n26. In the joint application for leave to defend the suit/written\nstatement, the respondent No.1 has denied execution of Letter of Guarantee\ndated 24 February 2007. She has also denied submission of Security to\n\nsecure the restructured TL facility with the contention that the\n\n3 PLD 2020 SC 736\n42009 SCMR 767\n51997 SCMR 1224\n\nCA No. 164 of 2025 8\n\nRestructuring Agreement dated 15t June 2009 is based upon fake and\n\nforged documents.\n\n27. Contents of letter dated 22°4 October 2009 written by respondent\nNo.2 as CEO of respondent No.4 to the NIB Bank, available at page 403 of\nthe paper book (part-III), confirms the execution of Restructuring Agreement\ndated 15th June 2009 and it belies the contention of respondent No. 1 that\nthe Restructuring Agreement dated 15th June 2009 is based on fake &\n\nforged documents.\n\n28. Para Nos. 1, 2, 3 & 7 of the Letter of Guarantee dated 24th February\n2007 duly signed and furnished to the PICIC Commercial Bank by\nrespondent No. 1 as one of the Director of respondent No.4 in pursuance of\n\n274 RF agreement, being relevant, are reproduced hereinbelow:\n\n“1.

Any account settled between you and the Customer or\nany demand by you on the Customer or his agent or any\njudgment or award obtained by you against the Customer or\nany statement from you stating the amount due to you at any\ntime from the Customer shall be accepted by me/us as\nconclusive evidence or my/our liability under this guarantee\nand shall be binding on me/us and I /we hereby waive all\nrights to question and or challenge the same.”\n\nFrom the above it reveals that the Guarantee furnished by respondent\nNo. 1 on 24th February 2007 in pursuance of 2™4 renewal RF facility is\ncontinuing as no notice of discontinuance thereof was ever issued by\n\nrespondent No.1 to the appellant or NIB Bank or PICIC Commercial Bank:\n\n29. Section133 of the Contract Act reads as follows:\n\nCA No. 164 of 2025 9\n\n“Discharge of surety by variance in terms of\ncontract. Any variance, made without the surety’s consent, in\nthe terms of the contract between the principal [debtor] and the\ncreditor, discharges the surety as to transactions subsequent to\nthe variance.”\n\nClause 5.11(f) of the Restructuring Agreement dated 15» June 2009 duly\n\nsigned by respondent No. 1 as a Guarantor, being relevant, reads as follows:\n\n“5.11 Securities\n\nAny and all securities created by the Customer in favour of the Bank\nare in full force and effect. Without prejudice to the generality of the\naforesaid, the following securities already created in favour of the\nBank shall continue to subsist and secure all amounts becoming due\nor payable by the Customer to the Bank under this Agreement or under\nany other documents executed by the Customer pursuant to this\nAgreement:\n\n(f) personal guarantees of all directors of the Customer\nguaranteeing all obligations of the Customer.”\n\n30. Being signatory of the Restructuring Agreement dated 15t» June 2009\nas a Guarantor, the respondent No.1 has made the following\n\nacknowledgment which is annexed at page 401 of the paper book (part-III):\n\n“The Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, confirm\nand acknowledge the aforesaid terms and the guarantees\nexecuted by them will continue to remain effective and in force\nuntil all amounts payable by the Customer are fully paid to the\nsatisfaction of the Bank.”\n\n31. In view of all the above, we have no hesitation to conclude that the\nGuarantee furnished by respondent No.1 on 24» February 2007 as one of\nthe Directors of respondent No.4 in pursuance of 2\"4 renewed RF facility to\nsecure all amounts becoming due or payable by respondent No.4 is\ncontinuing with consent of respondent No. 1 and same does not stand\ndischarged under section 133 of the Contract Act 1872 due to variance in\nterms of contract i.e. execution of Restructuring Agreement dated 15tt June\n\n2009 which has also been signed by respondent No. 1 as a Guarantor.\n\n32. According to the settled principles, if variation or composition of the\nloan or time etc. as to its repayment was allowed by the creditor to the\nborrower and consent/assent in advance thereto was given by the\nguarantor in the letter of guarantee, subsequent to the date of guarantee,\nsuch variation, composition, extension, change or indulgence being within\nthe contemplation of the parties at the time of execution of guarantee did\nnot affect discharge of the surety/guarantee from obligations under the\n\nguarantee. And as such surety continued to be bound by the terms of the\n\nCA No. 164 of 2025 10\n\nguarantee despite moratorium, enlargement of time, composition and\nvariations between the creditors and principal borrower. Reliance in this\nregard is placed on the cases of “Aftab A. Sheikh” (referred by learned\ncounsel for the appellant) and Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan\n\nv. Hyderabad Beverage Co. (Pvt.) Limited®.\n\n33. Since no substantial question of facts or law, requiring evidence to be\nrecorded, had arisen to the extent of respondent No.1, therefore there was\nno occasion for the learned DB of LHC to grant respondent No.1 leave to\n\ndefend the suit vide impugned judgment dated 13tt January 2025.\n\n34. It is concluded that while partly accepting appeal to the extent of\nrespondent No.1 after holding the same as not barred by time and granting\nleave to defend the suit to respondent No. 1, the learned DB of LHC has\n\nerred in facts as well as law.\n\n35. For the above reasons, the instant appeal is accepted with no order\nas to costs.

            "CleanedText": "JUDGMENT Naeem Akhter Afghan, J. Respondent Nos. 1, 2 3 are the Directors of respondent No. 4 Tanveer Weavings Private Limited . In January 2004 Respondent No.4 through respondent Nos. 2 3 approached Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation Commercial Bank Limited PICIC Commercial Bank for grant of a short-term finance facility for the purpose of meeting its capital requirements. In all the relevant documents, deeds, Sanction Letters and Agreements with the Banks, the respondent No. 4 has been mentioned as the Customer . Respondent No.2, being one of the Directors and authorized agent, is the Chief Executive Officer CEO of respondent No. 4. 2. After complying with all due formalities/requirements, Running Finance RF facility for the sum of Rs.50,000,000/- Rupees Fifty Million for one year and another facility of Rs.19 million was sanctioned on 29th January 2004 for respondent No. 4 and in this regard Finance Facility Agreement dated 31st January 2004 was executed between the parties. The parties also executed a Finance Facility Agreement on markup basis in the sum of Rs.19,000,000/- Rupees Nineteen Million . The respondent Nos. 2 3 furnished securities by hypothecation of moveable properties, hypothecation of receivables, creation of equitable mortgages and execution CA No. 164 of 2025 2 of irrevocable power of attorney in respect of different properties. Respondent No.2 also submitted continuing Personal Guarantee vide Letter of Guarantee dated 31st January 2004. 3. In October 2004, on the request of respondent No.2, the RF facility of Rs.50 million was enhanced to Rs.70 million for respondent No. 4 for a limited period and in this regard Running Finance Enhancement Sanction was also made on the basis of terms and conditions agreed by respondent No.2. 4. The RF facility as enhanced expired in the year 2005. By that time the other facility of Rs.19 million was discharged however default was made in making repayment of the Principal, markup and other amounts due in respect of RF facility of Rs.70 million. Respondent Nos. 2, 3 4 requested for renewal of the Enhanced RF facility which was accepted by the PICIC Commercial Bank vide 224 Sanction Letter whereafter renewed Running Finance Agreement dated 12 may 2005 was executed and RF facility of Rs.70 million on markup basis was renewed for period of one year. Supplementary letter of hypothecation of moveable properties and supplementary letter of hypothecation of receivables, memorandum of deposit of title deeds, and continuing Guarantee were furnished by respondent No.2. 5. Despite continuous default in making repayments of the Principal, markup and other amounts due in respect of the renewed RF facility, in October 2005, the respondent No.2 sought further enhancement in the existing credit package which was not materialized. 6. On 18th April 2006, while acknowledging the liabilities, respondent No.2 sought indulgence by the PICIC Commercial Bank for release of one of the mortgaged properties for clearing the outstanding dues. On the basis of assurance/commitment by respondent No.2 for payment of the obligations, the PICIC Commercial Bank released one of the mortgaged properties i.e. Plot No.400/D-11 II, Peoples Colony, Faisalabad. 7. On expiry of renewed RF facility and due to continuous and willful default in repayment of the Principal, markup and other amounts, respondent No.2, while admitting the liability, requested the PICIC Commercial Bank to rollover/renew the RF facility. The request of respondent No.2 was accepted and 34 sanction letter dated 24th February 2007 was issued by the PICIC Commercial bank whereby the RF facility in the sum of Rs.70 million was further renewed. Respondent Nos.1, 2 3 CA No. 164 of 2025 3 executed the 2 renewed RF agreement with PICIC Commercial Bank. Apart from furnishing the requisite securities for due performance of obligations under the 2 4 renewed RF agreement, the respondent Nos. 1, 2 3 executed continuing Guarantees in favour of PICIC Commercial Bank vide Separate letters of Guarantee dated 24th February 2007. Note: The continuing letter of Guarantee dated 24 February 2007 duly signed and executed by respondent No.1, being relevant for decision of the instant appeal, is available at to 378 of paper book Part-Ill . 8. Pursuant to Amalgamation Scheme duly sanctioned by the State Bank of Pakistan on 31st December 2007, the NIB Bank Limited NIB Bank stood amalgamated/merged with PICIC Commercial Bank and Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation Limited PICIC . The entire undertaking of PICIC Commercial Bank and PICIC including all properties, assets, liabilities and all rights and obligations of PICIC Commercial Bank and PICIC stood amalgamated with and vested into the NIB Bank. 9. In December 2007 partial payment of outstanding markup was made in pursuance of 2 4 renewed RF facility. Keeping in view the expiry of 274 renewed RF facility, respondent No.2 approached NIB Bank with request for further renewal of RF facility for another term with undertaking for appropriate utilization of the funds for respondent No.4. The request so made by respondent No.2 was accepted by the Board of Directors of NIB Bank in pursuance whereof 4th sanction letter and 3 4 renewed RF facility was sanctioned for respondent No.4 in the sum of Rs.70 million subject to furnishing securities and execution of 3 renewed RF agreement. Respondent Nos. 1, 2 3 executed the 3 4 renewed RF agreement dated 24 January 2008 with NIB Bank on the same terms as of the 2 4 renewed RF agreement. The respondent Nos.1, 2 3 also executed a promissory note dated 24 January 2008 as a continuing security for payment of the ultimate balance in pursuance of 3 4 renewed RF agreement dated 2 4 January 2008 which is available at of the paper book Part-III . 10. The respondent Nos. 1 to 4 continued willful default and made only partial payments in pursuance of 3 renewed RF facility. On expiry of 34 renewed RF facility, while acknowledging and admitting the obligations for repayment under the 3 renewed RF facility, the NIB Bank was approached by respondent No.2 on behalf of respondent No. 4 with request to convert/restructure the outstanding renewed RF facility into a long term facility. The Board of Directors of NIB Bank accepted the request and vide CA No. 164 of 2025 4 Restructuring Sanction Letter dated 15 June 2009, the NIB Bank sanctioned the conversion/restructuring of the 3 renewed RF facility into a Term Loan TL facility for respondent No. 4 subject to execution of Restructuring Agreement which was executed on 15th June 2009. 11. In partial fulfilment of obligations under the TL facility an amount of Rs.5 lakhs was paid on 22 4 December 2009 but the minimum monthly payments due from 15th July 2009 till 15 November 2009 were not made by respondent Nos. 1 to 4 despite availing opportunities. The NIB Bank, left with no other option, filed suit against respondent Nos.1 to 4 in October 2013 before Lahore High Court LHC under section 9 of the Financial Institutions Recovery of Finances Ordinance, 2001 Ordinance of 2001 read with all relevant and other enabling provisions of law for recovery of Rs.108,516,398.30/- Rupees One Hundred and Eight Million five Hundred and Sixteen Thousand Three Hundred and Ninety eight and thirty Paisas only as on 25 February 2013 alongwith cost of funds through sale of mortgaged and charged properties. 12. In the suit the NIB Bank also arrayed Bank Alfalah Limited, Muslim Commercial Bank MCB Limited and Askari Commercial Bank Limited as defendant Nos. 5, 6 7 respectively on the ground that Bank Alfalah Limited holds a pari passu charge alongwith the NIB Bank over the current assets of respondent No. 4 and MCB Limited as well as Askari Commercial Bank Limited also have charges over the moveable and immovable assets of respondent No.4. 13. Respondent Nos. 1 to 4 submitted a joint application on 29th November 2013 under section 10 of the Ordinance of 2001, in the form of written statement, for grant of unconditional leave to defend the suit and recording evidence while denying the liabilities claimed by the NIB Bank. 14. Being plaintiff, the NIB Bank submitted replication dated 8t May 2014 to the application/written statement of respondent Nos. 1 to 4. 15. While dismissing the application of respondent Nos.1 to 4 for leave to defend the suit, the suit filed by the NIB Bank was decreed by the learned Single Bench SB of LHC vide judgment and decree dated 14th April 2017 in the sum of Rs.108,516,398.30/- together with costs of funds as contemplated by section 3 of the Ordinance of 2001 and with costs of the suit on the ground that respondent Nos. 1 to 4 had failed to raise any dispute on facts requiring its determination through recording of evidence. CA No. 164 of 2025 5 16. Feeling aggrieved of the judgment and decree dated 14 April 2017 passed by the learned SB of LHC, respondent Nos. 1 to 4 filed RFA No. 116017/2017 against NIB Bank and others before the learned Division Bench DB of LHC. 17. RFA was dismissed by the learned DB of LHC vide judgment and decree dated 13th January 2025 to the extent of respondent Nos. 2 to 4, however, the same was partly accepted to the extent of respondent No.1 and by overruling the objection of the appellant about the RFA being barred by time, the Respondent No.1 was granted leave to defend the suit on the basis of the contention of learned counsel that the respondent No.1 did not furnish fresh Guarantee in pursuance of the Restructuring Agreement dated 15th June 2009 and on the ground that substantial question of law and fact to the extent of respondent No.1 has been raised by the learned counsel which requires recording of evidence. 18. Feeling aggrieved of the judgment and decree dated 13 January 2025 passed by learned DB of LHC in favour of respondent No.1, the MCB Limited has filed the instant Appeal as in pursuance of order dated 13th June 2017 passed by State Bank of Pakistan, NIB Bank stood merged with and amalgamated into MCB Limited. The MCB Limited is the successor in interest of NIB Bank in respect of its all assets, liabilities, rights and obligations. 19. Learned counsel for the appellant contended that while partly accepting the appeal to the extent of respondent No.1, the learned DB of LHC has failed to appreciate that respondent No. 1 and respondent Nos. 2 to 4 had jointly filed appeal against the judgment and decree dated 14th April 2017 passed by SB of LHC on 9th June 2017 without affixing the requisite court fee on the memo of appeal; office objection was raised and three days time was afforded to respondent Nos. 1 to 4 for compliance of the office objection but memo of appeal was refiled by respondent Nos. 1 to 4 by affixing the requisite court fee on 4 December 2017 and as such the appeal of respondent Nos. 1 to 4 was time barred by 173 days. While referring to the case of Siddique Khan v. Abdul Shakur Khan!, learned counsel contended that the conduct of respondent Nos. 1 to 4 was contumacious and as such RFA, being time barred, was liable to be dismissed by the learned DB of LHC. PLD 1984 SC 289 CA No. 164 of 2025 6 According to learned counsel, the objection of time barred appeal filed by respondent Nos. 1 to 4 before the learned DB of LHC has not been dealt with by the learned DB of LHC in accordance with the settled principles of law. 20. Learned counsel for the appellant further contended that the Restructuring Agreement dated 15th June 2009 was signed by the three Directors of respondent No.4 including respondent No.1 and the Guarantees of all the Directors of respondent No.4 i.e. respondent Nos.1, 2 3 were continuing/subsisting; there exists no substantial question of facts or law requiring evidence to be recorded; there was no occasion for the learned DB of LHC to grant respondent No.1 leave to defend the suit. 21. Learned counsel for respondent Nos. 1 4 contended that the appeal filed by respondent Nos. 1 to 4 before the learned DB of LHC has rightly been entertained/partly accepted to the extent of respondent No.1 as the office objection was vague and not specific; the conduct of the respondent Nos.1 to 4 was not contumacious as in compliance of office objection, the requisite court fee was affixed while refiling the appeal. Learned counsel for respondent Nos. 1 to 4 further contended that the respondent No. 1 did not furnish any fresh Guarantee in pursuance of Restructuring Agreement dated 15th June 2009; the Guarantee furnished by respondent No. 1 in pursuance of 2 4 renewed RF agreement of year 2007 stood discharged under section 133 of the Contract Act 1872 Contract Act due to variance in terms of the contract by execution of Restructuring Agreement dated 15tt June 2009 i.e.; the grant of leave to respondent No.1 for defending the suit by the learned DB of LHC in the above circumstances is not suffering from any illegality. 22. In rebuttal, learned counsel for the appellant contended that the Guarantee furnished by respondent No.1 in pursuance of 2 4 renewed RF agreement of year 2007 is continuing; the same was never revoked by respondent No.1; moreover, the respondent No. 1 had also signed the Restructuring Agreement dated 15 June 2009 as a Guarantor due to which section 133 of the Contract Act 1872 is not attracted and in this regard learned counsel referred the case of Aftab A. Sheikh v. Trust Leasing Corporation Limited?2. 23. After hearing learned counsel for the parties, we have perused the available record which reveals that respondent Nos.1 to 4 filed appeal 2 2003 CLD 702 CA No. 164 of 2025 7 against the judgment and decree dated 14 April 2017 passed by learned SB of LHC on 9 June 2017 without affixing the requisite court fee on the memo of appeal. The office objection proforma of LHC is available at of CMA No.1535/2025. At the bottom of said proforma, at Serial No.27, the office of LHC had raised objection on 9tt June 2017 on the appeal of respondent Nos. 1 to 4 in the words incomplete . In the end of the proforma, it has been written as follows: Return with objections at Sr. Nos. To be re-submitted after removal of these objection s within 03 three day s subject to limitation. 24. It has specifically been mentioned in the office objection proforma that the office objections have to be removed/complied with within three days subject to limitation. It was very much in the knowledge of respondent Nos. 1 to 4 and their counsel that the appeal is incomplete due to non-affixation of the requisite court fee. Neither the requisite court fee was filed within three days of the office objection nor any application was filed before the court for extending time to affix the requisite court fee on the memo of appeal. The appeal was refiled by respondent Nos. 1 to 4 with requisite court fee on 4th December 2017 i.e. after delay of 173 days whereas under subsection 1 of section 22 of the Ordinance of 2001 it was to be filed within thirty days. The same was not accompanied with any application for condonation of delay in filing the appeal. The above portrays that the conduct of respondent Nos. 1 to 4 was contumacious. 25. According to the settled principles, if the objections raised by the office are not removed during the period allowed by the office and in the meanwhile the limitation period expires and the conduct of the appellant is considered to be contumacious, the appeal has to be rejected being time barred. Reliance in this regard is placed on the cases of Siddique Khan referred by learned counsel for the appellant , Asad Ali v. Bank of Punjab , Controller Land Acquisition v. Fazal-ur-Rehman and Lahore Development Authority v. Muhammad Rashid 26. In the joint application for leave to defend the suit/written statement, the respondent No.1 has denied execution of Letter of Guarantee dated 24 February 2007. She has also denied submission of Security to secure the restructured TL facility with the contention that the 3 PLD 2020 SC 736 42009 SCMR 767 51997 SCMR 1224 CA No. 164 of 2025 8 Restructuring Agreement dated 15t June 2009 is based upon fake and forged documents. 27. Contents of letter dated 22 4 October 2009 written by respondent No.2 as CEO of respondent No.4 to the NIB Bank, available at of the paper book part-III , confirms the execution of Restructuring Agreement dated 15th June 2009 and it belies the contention of respondent No. 1 that the Restructuring Agreement dated 15th June 2009 is based on fake forged documents. 28. Para Nos. 1, 2, 3 7 of the Letter of Guarantee dated 24th February 2007 duly signed and furnished to the PICIC Commercial Bank by respondent No. 1 as one of the Director of respondent No.4 in pursuance of 274 RF agreement, being relevant, are reproduced hereinbelow: 1. My/Our liability under this guarantee shall be that of principal debtor and you may at your option hold me/us primarily responsible for the liabilities of the customer. 2. This guarantee shall continue to remain binding on me/us until receipt by you of written notice of discontinuance thereof and notwithstanding such notice I/we shall continue to remain liable to you for all sums due and owing to you by the customer whether certain or contingent upto the time of receipt by you of such notice and also for any credits established for the customer and/or all instrument drawn on you or accepted by you, for the benefit of the customer and purporting to be ona date on or before the date of receipt of such notice, even though actually paid or honoured after that date. 3. This guarantee shall not be discharged or prejudiced by any partial payments or settlements of account or existence of a credit balance of the customer at any time or by discharge of the customer by operation of law or for any other reason. 7. Any account settled between you and the Customer or any demand by you on the Customer or his agent or any judgment or award obtained by you against the Customer or any statement from you stating the amount due to you at any time from the Customer shall be accepted by me/us as conclusive evidence or my/our liability under this guarantee and shall be binding on me/us and I /we hereby waive all rights to question and or challenge the same. From the above it reveals that the Guarantee furnished by respondent No. 1 on 24th February 2007 in pursuance of 2 4 renewal RF facility is continuing as no notice of discontinuance thereof was ever issued by respondent No.1 to the appellant or NIB Bank or PICIC Commercial Bank: 29. Section133 of the Contract Act reads as follows: CA No. 164 of 2025 9 Discharge of surety by variance in terms of contract. Any variance, made without the surety s consent, in the terms of the contract between the principal debtor and the creditor, discharges the surety as to transactions subsequent to the variance. Clause 5.11 f of the Restructuring Agreement dated 15 June 2009 duly signed by respondent No. 1 as a Guarantor, being relevant, reads as follows: 5.11 Securities Any and all securities created by the Customer in favour of the Bank are in full force and effect. Without prejudice to the generality of the aforesaid, the following securities already created in favour of the Bank shall continue to subsist and secure all amounts becoming due or payable by the Customer to the Bank under this Agreement or under any other documents executed by the Customer pursuant to this Agreement: f personal guarantees of all directors of the Customer guaranteeing all obligations of the Customer. 30. Being signatory of the Restructuring Agreement dated 15t June 2009 as a Guarantor, the respondent No.1 has made the following acknowledgment which is annexed at of the paper book part-III : The Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, confirm and acknowledge the aforesaid terms and the guarantees executed by them will continue to remain effective and in force until all amounts payable by the Customer are fully paid to the satisfaction of the Bank. 31. In view of all the above, we have no hesitation to conclude that the Guarantee furnished by respondent No.1 on 24 February 2007 as one of the Directors of respondent No.4 in pursuance of 2 4 renewed RF facility to secure all amounts becoming due or payable by respondent No.4 is continuing with consent of respondent No. 1 and same does not stand discharged under section 133 of the Contract Act 1872 due to variance in terms of contract i.e. execution of Restructuring Agreement dated 15tt June 2009 which has also been signed by respondent No. 1 as a Guarantor. 32. According to the settled principles, if variation or composition of the loan or time etc. as to its repayment was allowed by the creditor to the borrower and consent/assent in advance thereto was given by the guarantor in the letter of guarantee, subsequent to the date of guarantee, such variation, composition, extension, change or indulgence being within the contemplation of the parties at the time of execution of guarantee did not affect discharge of the surety/guarantee from obligations under the guarantee. And as such surety continued to be bound by the terms of the CA No. 164 of 2025 10 guarantee despite moratorium, enlargement of time, composition and variations between the creditors and principal borrower. Reliance in this regard is placed on the cases of Aftab A. Sheikh referred by learned counsel for the appellant and Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan v. Hyderabad Beverage Co. Pvt. Limited . 33. Since no substantial question of facts or law, requiring evidence to be recorded, had arisen to the extent of respondent No.1, therefore there was no occasion for the learned DB of LHC to grant respondent No.1 leave to defend the suit vide impugned judgment dated 13tt January 2025. 34. It is concluded that while partly accepting appeal to the extent of respondent No.1 after holding the same as not barred by time and granting leave to defend the suit to respondent No. 1, the learned DB of LHC has erred in facts as well as law. 35. For the above reasons, the instant appeal is accepted with no order as to costs. The impugned judgment and decree dated 13 h January 2025 passed by the learned DB of LHC in favour of respondent No. 1 is set aside and RFA No. 116017/2017, being barred by time and having no merits, stands dismissed to the extent of respondent No.1 as well.

Petitioners\nVersus\n\nPetroleum Exploration Pvt. Limited through its Chief Executive Officer,\nIslamabad\n(in both cases)\n\n... Respondent\n\nFor the Petitioners: Ms. Zainab Janjua, Advocate High Court.\nFor the Respondent: N.R.\nDate of Hearing: 29.05.2025.\n\nORDER\n\nSyed Mansoor Ali Shah, J.- At the very outset, learned\n\ncounsel for the petitioners submitted that she is not an Advocate of this\nCourt and has filed a separate application in each case (C.M.As. No. 4089\n& 4090 of 2025) seeking special permission to appear in matter. She\nstated that she has previously handled the case before the Islamabad\nHigh Court and, owing to the urgency of the matter, the petitioner\ncompanies have not yet been able to engage an Advocate of the Supreme\nCourt. In view of the reasons stated, limited special permission is granted\nto the learned counsel to appear before this Court at this stage only. The\npetitioners are directed to engage an Advocate of the Supreme Court to\nargue the cases in the next stage. The present counsel shall be at liberty\nto assist any such counsel subsequently engaged in the matter. The\n\napplications stand disposed of accordingly.\nMain Case\n\n2. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the dispute\nbetween the parties was referred for arbitration under the auspices of the\nInternational Chamber of Commerce (ICC), London. Upon conclusion of\nthe proceedings, a partial foreign arbitral award was rendered on\n\n12.12.2024, and subsequently, a separate award on costs was issued on\n\nCPLA-1982/ 2025, etc. 2\n\n31.03.2025. The awards were filed before the Islamabad High Court for\nenforcement under the Recognition and Enforcement (Arbitration,\n\nAgreements and Foreign Arbitral Awards) Act, 2011 (“Act”).\n\n3. Learned counsel submits that while admitting the enforcement\npetition, the learned Single Judge of the High Court issued interim relief\nvide order dated 24.04.2025, restraining the respondents from assigning,\ntransferring, or alienating their working interest in Badin Fields and from\ncreating any charge, lien, or encumbrance thereon. This interim order\nwas subsequently challenged before a Division Bench in an intra-court\nappeal (“ICA”), which vide impugned order dated 19.05.2025, suspended\nthe interim relief granted by the learned Single Judge.\n\n4. It is contended that the interim relief was granted in aid of\nenforcement under the Act and did not amount to final relief. Courts are\nempowered to pass interim measures to protect the integrity and efficacy\nof the enforcement process. Denial of such protection would defeat the\nvery purpose of the Act and the New York Convention on the Recognition\nand Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, 1958 (“Convention”).\nReliance is placed on Taisei Corporation & another v. A.M. Construction\nCompany (Put.) Ltd. (2024 SCMR 640), Orient Power Company (Put.) Ltd,\nLahore v. Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd. (2021 SCMR 1728), Government\nof India v. Vedanta Limited_and Ors (AIR 2020 SC 4550), and Zeiler v.\nDeitsch (500 F.3d 157 (2007)) which affirm that courts must maintain a\n\npro-enforcement bias while dealing with foreign arbitral awards. It was\nfurther argued that the Division Bench interfered at the interim stage\nwithout recording or satisfying any of the limited grounds of non-\nenforcement under Article V of the Convention, as incorporated into the\nAct. Such premature judicial interference sends an adverse signal to the\ninternational community, undermines arbitral sanctity, erodes investor\nconfidence, and undermines Pakistan’s international obligations. A\nstable and enforcement-friendly legal environment is vital for\n\nencouraging foreign direct investment.\n\n5. It is further submitted with respect that the impugned order passed\nby the Division Bench, whereby the interim relief granted to the\npetitioners was suspended, has effectively obstructed the enforcement of\nthe foreign arbitral award and is therefore inconsistent with the pro-\nenforcement mandate of the Act, the Convention, and the settled\njurisprudence of this Court. Foreign arbitral awards are not to be treated\nas ordinary civil decrees; rather, they possess a binding character under\n\ninternational law, to which Pakistan has expressly committed itself.\n\nCPLA-1982/ 2025, etc. 3\n\n6. It is also contended that the ICA before the Division Bench was not\nmaintainable. Orders passed therein are not amenable to an ICA appeal\nunder Section 3(2) of the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972. It is well settled\nthat ICAs do not lie from orders passed under special laws that contain\na self-contained appellate mechanism and do not expressly provide for\nsuch appeals.

            "CleanedText": "ORDER Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, J.- At the very outset, learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that she is not an Advocate of this Court and has filed a separate application in each case C.M.As. No. 4089 4090 of 2025 seeking special permission to appear in matter. She stated that she has previously handled the case before the Islamabad High Court and, owing to the urgency of the matter, the petitioner companies have not yet been able to engage an Advocate of the Supreme Court. In view of the reasons stated, limited special permission is granted to the learned counsel to appear before this Court at this stage only. The petitioners are directed to engage an Advocate of the Supreme Court to argue the cases in the next stage. The present counsel shall be at liberty to assist any such counsel subsequently engaged in the matter. The applications stand disposed of accordingly. Main Case 2. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the dispute between the parties was referred for arbitration under the auspices of the International Chamber of Commerce ICC , London. Upon conclusion of the proceedings, a partial foreign arbitral award was rendered on 12.12.2024, and subsequently, a separate award on costs was issued on CPLA-1982/ 2025, etc. 2 31.03.2025. The awards were filed before the Islamabad High Court for enforcement under the Recognition and Enforcement Arbitration, Agreements and Foreign Arbitral Awards Act, 2011 Act . 3. Learned counsel submits that while admitting the enforcement petition, the learned Single Judge of the High Court issued interim relief vide order dated 24.04.2025, restraining the respondents from assigning, transferring, or alienating their working interest in Badin Fields and from creating any charge, lien, or encumbrance thereon. This interim order was subsequently challenged before a Division Bench in an intra-court appeal ICA , which vide impugned order dated 19.05.2025, suspended the interim relief granted by the learned Single Judge. 4. It is contended that the interim relief was granted in aid of enforcement under the Act and did not amount to final relief. Courts are empowered to pass interim measures to protect the integrity and efficacy of the enforcement process. Denial of such protection would defeat the very purpose of the Act and the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, 1958 Convention . Reliance is placed on Taisei Corporation another v. A.M. Construction Company Put. Ltd. 2024 SCMR 640 , Orient Power Company Put. Ltd, Lahore v. Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd. 2021 SCMR 1728 , Government of India v. Vedanta Limited and Ors AIR 2020 SC 4550 , and Zeiler v. Deitsch 500 F.3d 157 2007 which affirm that courts must maintain a pro-enforcement bias while dealing with foreign arbitral awards. It was further argued that the Division Bench interfered at the interim stage without recording or satisfying any of the limited grounds of nonenforcement under Article V of the Convention, as incorporated into the Act. Such premature judicial interference sends an adverse signal to the international community, undermines arbitral sanctity, erodes investor confidence, and undermines Pakistan s international obligations. A stable and enforcement-friendly legal environment is vital for encouraging foreign direct investment. 5. It is further submitted with respect that the impugned order passed by the Division Bench, whereby the interim relief granted to the petitioners was suspended, has effectively obstructed the enforcement of the foreign arbitral award and is therefore inconsistent with the proenforcement mandate of the Act, the Convention, and the settled jurisprudence of this Court. Foreign arbitral awards are not to be treated as ordinary civil decrees; rather, they possess a binding character under international law, to which Pakistan has expressly committed itself. CPLA-1982/ 2025, etc. 3 6. It is also contended that the ICA before the Division Bench was not maintainable. Orders passed therein are not amenable to an ICA appeal under Section 3 2 of the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972. It is well settled that ICAs do not lie from orders passed under special laws that contain a self-contained appellate mechanism and do not expressly provide for such appeals. See Karim Bibi and others v. Hussain Bakhsh and another PLD 1984 SC 344 , Muhammad Abdullah v. Deputy Settlement Commissioner Lahore PLD 1985 SC 107 and International Islamic University, Islamabad v. Syed Naveed Altaf 2024 SCMR 472 . 7. In view of the above, leave is granted to consider the questions raised. The appeals arising out of these petitions shall be heard on the basis of available record, however, parties are at liberty to file additional documents, if any. The said appeals shall be listed before a three-member bench after a fortnight. C.M.As. No. 3673 3674/2025 Stay Matter : 8. Notice to the respondents. Meanwhile, the operation of the impugned order dated 19.05.2025 passed by the Division Bench of the Islamabad High Court shall remain suspended until the next date of hearing in order to be consistent with the pro-enforcement bias maintained by this Court as well as the mandate of the Act, the Convention, and the settled jurisprudence of this Court. The interim restraining order passed by the learned Single Judge shall remain in field and continue to operate. 9.

For the purposes of our consideration the\n\nmatter triggered when show cause notice dated 06.06.2012 issued by the\nInland Revenue officer, out of which Order-in-Original No.29/2012 dated\n\n31.12.2012 was passed against the petitioner.\n\n2. Aggrieved of it, the petitioner filed an appeal before the Commissioner\nInland Revenue, (Appeals), Gujranwala, which was dismissed vide Order-in-\nappeal dated 21.02.2013. The petitioner being aggrieved of the Order-in-\nOriginal and Order-in-Appeal preferred an appeal (STA No.401/LB/2013)\nbefore the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue, Lahore Bench, Lahore (‘the\n\nTribunal’) and vide order dated 28.08.2013, the appeal was accepted and\n\nCivil Petition No. 312 of 2025 2\n\ndecided in favour of the petitioner and the orders below were set aside and\n\nFIR registered against the petitioner was ordered to be quashed.\n\n3. The respondent thereafter being aggrieved of the order of the Tribunal\nfiled Sales Tax Reference No. 15/2014 before the Lahore High Court, which\nwas partially allowed and decided alongwith another connected reference\nraising same questions of law. The references were decided vide order dated\n\n11.05.2017 in favour of the respondent-department.\n\n4. It is at this point the learned counsel attempted to make a point that\ntwo questions of law in favour of respondent-department were answered,\nwhereas, the High Court declined to answer the third question of law on the\nbasis of the order of the Tribunal as it (Tribunal) made a reference to Clause\n42(b) of STGO No.3/2004, but did not give specific findings as to violation of\nsaid provisions. This being the bone of contention, the petitioner preferred\nCPLA No.3717/2017 against the aforesaid order passed in reference\njurisdiction, however, it was withdrawn vide order dated 14.01.2020,\nwhereas, he separately for a parallel recourse filed an application (M.A (R)\nNo.254/LB/2018) before the Tribunal in same disposed of STA\nNo.401/LB/2013 for fixation/rectification of the previous order of the\nTribunal dated 28.08.2013 to the extent of question of law and fact regarding\nfailure of the respondent-department in determining the liability under\nnormal tax regime, which claimed to have been overlooked by the Tribunal\nin the first round of litigation. Being influenced by the contention so raised,\nthe Tribunal on such application, which is primarily for the fixation of the\nsaid appeal, modified its order vide order dated 12.10.2018 in favour of the\npetitioner and against the respondent-department and both order-in-original\nand first appellate order stand vacated/cancelled, though it was taken to its\n\nlogical end up to this Court. As against the order on the said Miscellaneous\n\nCivil Petition No. 312 of 2025 3\n\napplication for fixation of the appeal, the respondent-department preferred a\nreference being STR No.39113/2019 on the ground that rectification\njurisdiction (as explained) could not have been exercised by the Tribunal. The\nSales Tax Reference was accepted vide order dated 17.12.2024 by a Division\nBench of the Lahore High Court, Lahore deciding the question of law in\nfavour of the respondent-department against which the instant CPLA was\n\nfiled by the petitioner.\n\n5. The first and primary contention of the counsel for the petitioner was\nthat the order of the High Court passed in STR No.11/2014 dated 11.05.2017\nwherein the court declined to answer third question, was in fact a remand\norder, which had saddled the Tribunal with a responsibility to decide the\nquestion which remained unanswered in the first round of litigation. The\nsecond contention was that the Tribunal was justified in considering the\napplication for fixation of appeal, as being application for rectification of the\n\norder.\n\n6. We have heard the learned counsel and perused the material available\non record. We do not find any ambiguity in the order of the Division Bench\nof the High Court passed in STR No.11/2014 as it is not a remand order nor\ndid it revive the appeal decided by the Tribunal in the first round of litigation.\nOne of the questions remained unanswered by Tribunal which consequently\nwas not answered by the court exercising reference jurisdiction. Neither any\nrequest was made in a reference filed by the respondent-department nor at\nthe time of withdrawal of the CPLA No.3717/2017 before this Court. The\npetitioner on its own moved an application for fixation of the appeal which\nappeal was never in existence, as it was disposed of vide order dated\n28.05.2018 in its totality. When the application for fixation of appeal was\n\nfiled we failed to understand that there was no lis pending and nothing could\n\nCivil Petition No. 312 of 2025 4\n\nhave been fixed for any leftover issue and hence the only way the Tribunal\nconceived it is by way of rectification application. Even the newly inserted\n(June, 2013) section 57 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 (‘the Act? has its\nlimitation in terms of the rectification sought. It is to be noticed that its\nretrospective effect was not questioned before the Tribunal and hence we\nwould not comment. Indeed, a rectification of mistake could be\namended/rectified by an order passed by the Tribunal which mistake is\napparent on the face of the record, however, it does not enlarge the scope of\nthe Tribunal to render a complete and altogether different decision,\nindependent of the earlier “view” as expressed.

                "Aggrieved of it, the petitioner filed an appeal before the Commissioner Inland Revenue, Appeals , Gujranwala, which was dismissed vide Order-inappeal dated 21.02.2013.",
                "The petitioner being aggrieved of the Order-inOriginal and Order-in-Appeal preferred an appeal STA No.401/LB/2013 before the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue, Lahore Bench, Lahore the Tribunal and vide order dated 28.08.2013, the appeal was accepted and Civil Petition No. 312 of 2025 2 decided in favour of the petitioner and the orders below were set aside and FIR registered against the petitioner was ordered to be quashed.",
                "The respondent thereafter being aggrieved of the order of the Tribunal filed Sales Tax Reference No. 15/2014 before the Lahore High Court, which was partially allowed and decided alongwith another connected reference raising same questions of law.",
                "The references were decided vide order dated 11.05.2017 in favour of the respondent-department.",
                "It is at this point the learned counsel attempted to make a point that two questions of law in favour of respondent-department were answered, whereas, the High Court declined to answer the third question of law on the basis of the order of the Tribunal as it Tribunal made a reference to Clause 42 b of STGO No.3/2004, but did not give specific findings as to violation of said provisions.",
                "This being the bone of contention, the petitioner preferred CPLA No.3717/2017 against the aforesaid order passed in reference jurisdiction, however, it was withdrawn vide order dated 14.01.2020, whereas, he separately for a parallel recourse filed an application M.A R No.254/LB/2018 before the Tribunal in same disposed of STA No.401/LB/2013 for fixation/rectification of the previous order of the Tribunal dated 28.08.2013 to the extent of question of law and fact regarding failure of the respondent-department in determining the liability under normal tax regime, which claimed to have been overlooked by the Tribunal in the first round of litigation.",
                "Being influenced by the contention so raised, the Tribunal on such application, which is primarily for the fixation of the said appeal, modified its order vide order dated 12.10.2018 in favour of the petitioner and against the respondent-department and both order-in-original and first appellate order stand vacated/cancelled, though it was taken to its logical end up to this Court.",
                "As against the order on the said Miscellaneous Civil Petition No. 312 of 2025 3 application for fixation of the appeal, the respondent-department preferred a reference being STR No.39113/2019 on the ground that rectification jurisdiction as explained could not have been exercised by the Tribunal.",
                "The Sales Tax Reference was accepted vide order dated 17.12.2024 by a Division Bench of the Lahore High Court, Lahore deciding the question of law in favour of the respondent-department against which the instant CPLA was filed by the petitioner.",
                "The first and primary contention of the counsel for the petitioner was that the order of the High Court passed in STR No.11/2014 dated 11.05.2017 wherein the court declined to answer third question, was in fact a remand order, which had saddled the Tribunal with a responsibility to decide the question which remained unanswered in the first round of litigation.",
                "The second contention was that the Tribunal was justified in considering the application for fixation of appeal, as being application for rectification of the order.",
                "We have heard the learned counsel and perused the material available on record.",
                "We do not find any ambiguity in the order of the Division Bench of the High Court passed in STR No.11/2014 as it is not a remand order nor did it revive the appeal decided by the Tribunal in the first round of litigation.",
                "One of the questions remained unanswered by Tribunal which consequently was not answered by the court exercising reference jurisdiction.",
                "Neither any request was made in a reference filed by the respondent-department nor at the time of withdrawal of the CPLA No.3717/2017 before this Court.",
                "The petitioner on its own moved an application for fixation of the appeal which appeal was never in existence, as it was disposed of vide order dated 28.05.2018 in its totality.",
                "When the application for fixation of appeal was filed we failed to understand that there was no lis pending and nothing could Civil Petition No. 312 of 2025 4 have been fixed for any leftover issue and hence the only way the Tribunal conceived it is by way of rectification application.",
                "Even the newly inserted June, 2013 section 57 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 the Act?",
                "has its limitation in terms of the rectification sought.",
                "It is to be noticed that its retrospective effect was not questioned before the Tribunal and hence we would not comment.",
                "Indeed, a rectification of mistake could be amended/rectified by an order passed by the Tribunal which mistake is apparent on the face of the record, however, it does not enlarge the scope of the Tribunal to render a complete and altogether different decision, independent of the earlier view as expressed.",
                "For the sake of convenience, section 57 of the Act is reproduced as under: 57.",
                "Rectification of Mistake.- 1 The officer of Inland Revenue, Commissioner, the Commissioner Appeals or the Appellate Tribunal may, by an order in writing, amend any order passed by him to rectify any mistake apparent from the record on his or its own motion or any mistake brought to his or its notice by a taxpayer or, in the case of the Commissioner Appeals or the Appellate Tribunal, the Commissioner.",

Through the impugned judgment dated\n21.01.2025, the petitioner was declined post-arrest bail in case FIR\nNo.207/2022 dated 28.02.2022, registered at Police Station Cantt District\nGujranwala, under section 406 of the Pakistan Penal Code (P.P.C); hence,\n\nthis petition for leave to appeal.\n\n2. Briefly stated, the facts of the case as alleged in the FIR are that the\ncomplainant was running an automobile showroom by the name of\nDefense Motors. On 04.10.2021, the petitioner and a co-accused\npurchased and took a vehicle, owned by one Muhammad Shakeel, from\nthe complainant’s showroom after paying part payment of the sale amount\nwith a promise to pay the remaining amount within one month and both\nparties entered into a written agreement dated 06.10.2021 in this regard.\nIn a similar fashion and on the same terms, the petitioner purchased a\n\nsecond vehicle from the complainant’s showroom after paying part\n\nCrl. P.170-L/2025\n\npayment through an agreement dated 19.11.2021. On 30.10.2021 the\npetitioner purchased a third vehicle from the complainant’s showroom\nafter paying part payment with a promise to pay the remaining amount\nwithin a month. Lastly, as per the complainant’s story, the petitioner came\nto the complainant’s showroom on 02.01.2022, promised the complainant\nto pay all remaining dues by 03.01.2022 and took another vehicle from\nthe complainant’s showroom, undertaking to show the same at different\nshowrooms for the purpose of sale. However, when the complainant tried\nto contact the petitioner after some time, he failed to do so and found out\nthat the petitioner had misappropriated all the vehicles of the complainant.\n\nThe details of all said vehicles, as given in FIR No.207/2022, are as follows:\n\nSr Vehicle Registration | E-Stamp Date of | Total Price | Partial\nNo. | Detail Number Transaction Payment\n1 KIA ACH/443 PFCFC8BA09169FD3 | 04.10.2021 58,00,000/- | 10,00,000/-\nSportage Dated 06.10.2021\n2 Vezel Applied For 9530DCF440CB24D2 | 19.11.2021 41,00,000/- | 10,00,000/-\nDated 19.11.2021\n3 Corolla AVG690 J eee 30.10.2021 39,00,000/- | 12,00,000/-\nAltas\n4 Toyota LEE-15-1202 |  ——_----- 02.01.2022 | ----- ===\nCorolla\nGLI\nModel 15\n3. Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that from the contents\n\nof the FIR, offence punishable under section 406 P.P.C is not made out\nagainst the petitioner and additionally, the offence does not fall within the\nambit of the prohibitory clause of section 497(1) Cr.P.C. He has also\ncontended that despite of being on physical remand and behind the bars\nfor a considerable period of time, none of the vehicles mentioned in the FIR\nhave been recovered from the petitioner. Lastly, he pointed out that the\nFIR was lodged after a considerable delay of 5 months and argued that the\n\nabove said circumstances entitle the petitioner to post-arrest bail.\n\n4. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the complainant has\nvehemently opposed the instant petition. He contended that all the\nvehicles in question were handed over and entrusted to the petitioner by\nthe complainant as ‘amanat’ but the _ petitioner dishonestly\nmisappropriated the same. He argued that the vehicles were given to the\npetitioner as a trust (amanat) and the said fact is explicitly stated in the\nFIR. As such, the offence under section 405 P.P.C is made out and section\n406 P.P.C is fully attracted in the circumstances of this case. However,\n\nwhen the learned Addl. PG was confronted with as to whether an offence\n\nCrl. P.170-L/2025\n\nunder section 405 P.P.C is made out against the petitioner, he concedes\nthat the requisite elements of section 405 P.P.C are absent in this case\nand, at most, an offence under section 420 P.P.C is made out from the\n\ncontents of the FIR.\n\n5. In order to properly address the controversy pertaining to the\napplicability of section 406 P.P.C to the facts of the present case, we find\nit proper to refer to section 405 P.P.C, which defines criminal breach of\n\ntrust and is thus, relevant for our present purpose:\n\n405. Criminal breach of trust. Whoever, being in any manner entrusted\nwith property or with any dominion over property, dishonestly\nmisappropriates or converts to his own use that property, or dishonestly\nuses or disposes of that property in violation of any direction of law\nprescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged, or of any legal\ncontract, express or implied, which he has made touching the discharge of\nsuch trust, or wilfully suffers any other person so to do, commits “criminal\n\nbreach of trust”.\n\nA plain reading of aforesaid section reveals that, there are two requisite\nelements which are necessary to establish a case of criminal breach of\ntrust. Firstly, the accused must have been entrusted with a property as\ntrust (amanat), or must have dominion over it as trust (amanat). Secondly,\nafter such entrustment or dominion is created, the accused must have\nbreached that trust by either dishonestly misappropriating or converting\nthe property to his own use, or dishonestly using or disposing of it in\nviolation of any direction of law, an express or implied legal contract\nrelated to the discharge of the trust, or willfully allowing another person\nto do any of these acts. Both of these elements need to be present in order\nto constitute criminal breach of trust, as was held by this Court in cases\nreported as Abdul Rashid Nasir v. The State (2009 SCMR 517) and Ali\nRaza v. The State (2022 SCMR 1223).\n\n6. The term ‘entrustment’, as used in section 405 P.P.C, means that a\nproperty is given to a person as a trust (amanat), whereby, a confidence is\nreposed in the recipient person and he is obligated to return the same to\nperson making the entrustment. The attachment of this obligation in the\nentrustment implies that the ownership of the property in question\n\nremains with the person who has given the property and has not been\n\nCrl. P.170-L/2025\n\ntransferred, in any manner, to the person receiving the property, who is\nonly temporarily given possession/custody of the entrusted property for a\nspecific purpose and the same property is to be returned by the said\nperson. The entrusted property cannot be used by or disposed of in any\nother manner or for any purpose other than as was decided by the person\nmaking the entrustment. In this manner, entrustment creates a fiduciary\nrelationship between the giver and receiver of the entrusted property.\nHowever, this does not automatically imply that entrustment has to\ncomply with the technicalities of trust law. This position has been affirmed\nin several judgments and reference in this respect may be made to the\ncases reported as Zahid Jameel v S.H.O. and 2 others (2008 YLR 2695\nLahore), Shahid Imran v The State and others (2011 SCMR 1614) and\nMuhammad Ali v. Samina Qasim Tarar and others (2022 SCMR 2001).\n\n7. It is also trite law that the term ‘entrustment’ is used in a broad\nsense under section 405 P.P.C and therefore, it encompasses a wide\nvariety of contexts in which a property is handed over by an owner to a\nrecipient person as trust (amanat). This is evident from the illustrations\nprovided in section 405 P.P.C, which demonstrate various situations\nwherein the offence of criminal breach of trust can be committed.\nReference in this regard can also be made to Muhammad Aili (ibid),\n\nwherein this court was pleased to hold that:\n\n8B. eee Expression entrustment with the property or any domain\n\nover the property has been used in a broader sense under section\n\n405 P.P.C. It has wide and different_implications in different\n\ncontext. While expression ‘trust’ in section 405 PPC, is a comprehensive\nexpression and has been used to denote various types of relationships, like\nrelationship of trustee and beneficiary, bailor and bailee, master and\n\nservant, pledgor and pledgee.\n\nAn entrustment can arise in any situation wherein property has been\nentrusted in the above discussed manner leading to the creation of a\nfiduciary relationship between the giver and recipient of the entrusted\nproperty. However, there are a number of situations in which no\nentrustment is made, thereby excluding the possibility of the commission\nof criminal breach of trust as defined under section 405 P.P.C. Foremost\namong such situations are those in which money or property is invested,\n\nsold or given for a business purpose entailing a promise of profit.\n\nCrl. P.170-L/2025\n\n8. In the case reported as Shahid Imran (supra), this court has clearly\ndilated upon the evident distinction between investment of property and\nentrustment of property, ruling that an investment of property does not\n\ncreate entrustment of property:\n\nBo ee A perusal of the F.I.R. registered in this case clearly shows that\nthe complainant had given the above mentioned sum of money to the\npetitioner by way of an investment in a business venture and not by way of\n\nentrustment. The law clearly recognizes _a_ distinction between\n\npayment/investment of money and entrustment of money or property\n\nas in the former case the amount of money paid or invested is to be\n\nutilized for some purpose whereas in the latter case that sum of\n\nmoney or property is to be retained and preserved for its return to\n\nthe giver and the same is never meant to be utilized for any other\n\npurpose. Recognition of this distinction stands clearly reflected in many\ncases decided by different courts in the Indo-Pak sub-continent and a\nreference in this respect may be to the cases of State of Gujarat v.\nJaswantlal Nathalal (AIR 1968 SC 700), Punjab National Bank and others\nv. Surendra Prasad Sinha (1994 PSC (Cri) 768), Shaukat Ali Sagar v. Station\nHouse Officer, Police Station Batala Colony, Faisalabad and 5 others (2006\nPCr.LJ 1900), Ghulam Ali v. Javid and another (1989 PCr.LJ 507), Nga Po\nSeik v. Emperor (1917 Indian Cases 824) and Kornai Lal Dutta v. The State\n(AIR 1951 Cal 206). These precedent cases clearly show that a mere breach\nof a promise, agreement or contract does not ipso facto attract the definition\nof criminal breach of trust contained in section 405, P.P.C. and such a breach\nis not synonymous with criminal breach of trust without there being a clear\n\nelement of entrustment therein which entrustment has been violated.\n\nTherefore, in a situation where property or money is invested in a business\nventure it is utilized for some business purpose, whereas, in a situation of\nentrustment, the property in question is given for a specific purpose —\nnamely, to be returned—and cannot be used for any other purpose by the\nrecipient. If the entrusted property is dishonestly misappropriated and\nused for any other purpose, it would result in a criminal breach of trust.\nThis Court has consistently recognized this distinction in the cases\nreported as Rafiq Haji Usman v. Chairman, NAB and another (2015\nSCMR 1575) and Hashmat Ullah v. The State and others (2019 SCMR\n1730), further endorsing the ratio decidendi of Shahid Imran (supra).\n\nCrl. P.170-L/2025\n\n9. In a similar fashion, it is also trite law that where money or property\nis given as part of an agreement to sell or in the due course of a transaction\nof sale, the same does not amount to an entrustment. In the case reported\nas Rafiq Haji Usman (supra), this Court has clearly laid out the position\n\nof law on this aspect:\n\n40, From the above it is clear that an essential element for making out\nand establishing a case of criminal breach of trust is the entrustment of\nproperty or money or with any dominion over property, which is dishonestly\nmisappropriated or dishonestly used or disposed in violation of any direction\nprescribed by law or the mode in which such trust was to be discharged or\n\nin the context any contract etc., however the promise to sell the property\n\nfor which consideration/money is paid or an agreement to sell is\n\nentered upon and the money has been paid pursuant to such an\n\nagreement, it shall not the same _as entrustment of property within\n\nthe concept of noted provision. In case of entrustment, the\n\nmoney/ property received is to be retained for return to the giver at a later\ntime as opposed to a promise or contract where investment is made or\nmoney is paid for the purposes of fulfillment of a specific agreed upon\n\npurpose/contract. In_such_a_case_ where _money/property has_ been\n\nentrusted to a person, using such _amount/property for any other\n\npurpose would not attract the penal consequences of section 405\n\nibid. For the purposes of above view, we draw support from the judgment\nof this Court reported as Shahid Imran v. The State and another (2011 SCMR\n1614)...\n\nIn the case of a sale, the ownership of the concerned property does not\nremain with the person giving the property, but rather, it stands\ntransferred to the recipient. Consequently, the concerned property is not\nto be returned to the owner so there is no concept of entrustment or trust\n(amanat), as required for criminal breach of trust, in a transaction of sale.\nTherefore, as there can be no entrustment between a seller and a\npurchaser, relations between a shop-keeper and customer, vendor and\nvendee, or seller and purchaser does not come within the ambit of criminal\nbreach of trust as defined in section 405 P.P.C. Reference in this regard\n\ncan be made to Zahid Jameel (supra).\n\n10. As a necessary implication of the above discussion, it is also well\nrecognized that mere failure to pay profits, or a breach of promise,\n\nagreement or contract in the absence of clear entrustment of property, do\n\nCrl. P.170-L/2025\n\nnot attract criminal breach of trust. Reliance in this regard can be placed\non cases reported as Shahid Imran (supra), Lateef Ahmed v. The State\nand 3 others (2012 PCr.LJ 708 Lahore), Muhammad Saifullah Cheema\nv. Umer Hayat and 2 others (2022 PCr.LJ 1327 Lahore), Mumtaz\nHussain v. The State and another (2020 PCr.LJ 1661 Lahore), Khatija\nv. The State and another (PLJ 1973 Karachi 279), Ubedullah v. The\nState (2003 PCr.LJ 1921 Karachi), Haji Javed Iqbal v. The State (2004\nYLR 2288 Lahore) and Iqgrar Ahmed and another v. The State and\nanother (1999 YLR 1117 Karachi).\n\n11. There is also another important legal aspect of this case, namely,\nthat bail was refused vide the impugned judgment, notwithstanding the\nfact that the offence of criminal breach of trust punishable under section\n406 P.P.C does not fall within the prohibitory clause of section 497(1)\nCr.P.C. This refusal becomes questionable when examined in light of the\nsettled principle of law, namely, that in cases involving commission of non-\nbailable offences not falling within the prohibitory clause of 497(1) Cr.P.C,\nbail is granted as a rule and refusal is an exception. Disregard of this\ncardinal principle of bail jurisprudence warrants serious judicial\n\nintrospection.\n\n12. The principle that bail should be granted as a rule and withheld only\nin exceptional circumstances, particularly in cases involving non-bailable\noffences, not falling within the prohibitory clause of section 497(1) Cr.P.C.,\nhas been developed and applied in numerous judgements of this Court. In\nthe case reported as Mansha Khan and 2 others v. The State (1977\nSCMR 449), this Court granted bail to the appellants who had allegedly\ncaused 16 injuries, three of which were grievous in nature, to the injured\nvictim. The High Court had refused to grant bail to the appellants on the\nground of the number of injuries suffered by the victim, however, this\nCourt observed that the offence alleged was punishable with seven years\nrigorous imprisonment and did not fall under the prohibition contained in\nsection 497 Cr.P.C. therefore, bail could not be withheld simply because\nthe offence in question was non-bailable and heinous in nature. Likewise,\nin Allah Rakha and another v. The State (1993 SCMR 1994), this Court\ngranted bail to petitioners who were charged with causing Shajjah-e-\nMudihah on the sole ground that the said offence did not fall within\nprohibitory clause of section 497(1) Cr.P.C. This Court also granted bail in\n\nCrl. P.170-L/2025\n\nthe case reported as Muhammad Afsar v. The State (1994 SCMR 2051)\nwhich involved hurt caused as a result of firearm injury constituting an\noffence under section 337-F (ii) P.P.C. Bail was granted in this case as the\noffence did not fall under the prohibitory clause of section 497(1) Cr.P.C.\nThis Court followed the same principle in Javaid Iqbal and Another v.\nThe State (1995 SCMR 1090), where bail cancelled by the High Court was\nrestored because the offence did not fall within the prohibitory clause of\nsection 497(1) Cr.P.C. Although, the case involved multiple injuries, it was\nobserved that section 337 P.P.C., under which the petitioners were\ncharged, was punishable with three years' rigorous imprisonment and\n\ntherefore did not attract the prohibition on bail.\n\n13. This principle was authoritatively affirmed by this Court in a\nlandmark judgment reported as Tariq Bashir v. The State (PLD 1995 SC\n34). This Court analyzed the legal implications of the classification of non-\nbailable offences under Section 497(1) Cr.P.C. and was pleased to observe\n\nthe following:\n\n“6. It is crystal clear that in bailable offences the grant of bail is a right\nand not favour, whereas in non-bailable offences the grant of bail is not a\n\nright but concession/grace. Section 497, Cr.P.C. divided non-bailable\n\noffences into two categories i.e. (i) offences punishable with death,\n\nimprisonment of life or imprisonment for ten years; and (ii) offences\n\npunishable with imprisonment for less than ten years. The principle\n\nto be deduced from this provision of law is that _in_non-bailable\n\noffences falling in the second category (punishable with\n\nimprisonment for less than ten years) the grant of bail is 'a rule and\n\nrefusal an exception. So, the bail will be declined only in extraordinary\n\nand exceptional cases, for example-\n\n(a) where there is likelihood of abscondence of the accused;\n\n(b) where there is apprehension of the accused tampering with the\nprosecution evidence;\n\n(c) where there is danger of the offence being repeated if the accused\nis released on bail; and\n\n(d) where the accused is a previous convict.\n\nSection 497 Cr.P.C. bifurcates non-bailable offences into two distinct\n\ncategories: those that fall within the prohibitory clause and those that do\n\nCrl. P.170-L/2025\n\nnot. As per the dictum of the Tariq Bashir case (supra), in the latter\ncategory of cases, the grant of bail is a rule, whereas refusal is an\nexception. Such refusal can only be justified in extraordinary and\nexceptional circumstances, such as where the accused is likely to abscond,\ntamper with the prosecution evidence, repeat the offence, or is a previous\nconvict. Since the decision in Tariq Bashir (supra), this Court has\nconsistently reaffirmed the principles established therein through a series\nof subsequent judgments. Reference in this regard can be made to cases\nreported as Subhan Khan v. The State (2002 SCMR 1797), Zafar Iqbal\nv. Muhammad Anwar (2009 SCMR 1488), Muhammad Tanveer v. The\nState and Another (PLD 2017 SC 733), Arsalan Masih v. State (2019\nSCMR 1152), Muhammad Ramzan v. State (2020 SCMR 717), Dr. Abdur\nRauf v. The State (2020 SCMR 1258), Muhammad Nasir Shafique v.\nThe State (2021 SCMR 2092), Iftikhar Ahmad v. The State (PLD 2021\nSC 799), Muhammad Daniyal Farrukh Ansari v. The State (2021\nSCMR 557), Ahmad Khalid Butt v. State (2021 SCMR 1016), Abdul\nSaboor v. State (2022 SCMR 592), Nazir Ahmad v. State (2022 SCMR\n1467), Hilal Khattak v.

State (2023 SCMR 1997), Noman Khaliq v. State (2023 SCMR\n2122) and Ali Anwar Paracha v. The State (2024 SCMR 1596).\n\n14. Additionally, in order to give effect to foundational principles of\ncriminal jurisprudence regarding bails, namely that bail cannot be\nwithheld as punishment and basic law is bail not jail, it is necessary that\nthe exceptional circumstances for refusing bail as enumerated in Tariq\nBashir case (supra) be interpreted reasonably and judicially. Their scope\nmust not be widened unnecessarily in order to withhold bail where a clear\ncase of bail is made out, as was done in the case before us. The exceptions\nmust be interpreted in a manner to give effect to the spirit of section 497(1)\nCr.P.C, as elucidated in the Tariq Bashir case (supra), which envisions\nthat bail be granted as a rule in cases where the alleged offence does not\nfall within the prohibitory clause of the said section. For instance, bail\nshould not be withheld simply on the basis of an unsubstantiated\napprehension that the concerned accused will abscond, unless such\napprehension is based on some solid material available on the record, such\n\nas past behavior of accused. Even otherwise, where Courts may mitigate\n\n10\nCrl. P.170-L/2025\n\nsuch apprehensions by passing appropriate orders, they must do the same\nrather than simply denying bail to the accused. In case of apprehension of\nabscondence, the presence of the accused can be ensured by ordering him\nto submit substantial amount of securities/bail bonds. Similarly, bail\nshould not be withheld solely on the ground that the accused is nominated\nin other similar FIR’s. It is only a previous conviction—duly established\nthrough adjudication by trial— and not mere registration of other criminal\ncases, that can furnish a valid ground for denial of bail. This legal position\nhas been consistently upheld in various judgments of this Court.\nReference in this respect can be made to cases reported as Moundar and\nOthers v. The State (PLD 1990 SC 934), Muhammad Rafique (1997\nSCMR 412), Arsalan Masih v. State (2019 SCMR 1152), Babar Hussain\nv. State (2020 SCMR 871), Syeda Sumera Andaleeb v. The State (2021\nSCMR 1227), Nazir Ahmad v. State (2022 SCMR 1467) and Ali Anwar\nParacha v. The State (2024 SCMR 1596). It is a foundational principle of\ncriminal law that every person is innocent until proven guilty. Refusal of\nbail simply because the accused is nominated in another similar FIR would\nbe tantamount to inflicting punishment before trial, thereby undermining\nthe presumption of innocence. Likewise, discretion to refuse bail on the\napprehension that the accused may tamper with evidence should be\nexercised with caution. Section 173 Cr.P.C. clearly stipulates that the\npolice report (challan) must be completed within 14 days, which means\nthat the investigation and collection of evidence should be finalized within\nthis time frame, so the window for any potential tampering is inherently\nnarrow. Consequently, scope of refusing bail on this ground is limited and\ncan only be exercised when there is some substantial material on record\nindicating a real and imminent risk of tampering. In the case reported as\nSerajul Haq v. The State (1968 SCMR 251), this Court set aside an order\nin which bail was refused to the accused on the ground that there was an\napprehension of tampering with evidence but no substantial basis for this\nconcern was provided in the impugned order. This Court, therefore, held\nthat the apprehension of tampering was speculative and unfounded, and,\nas such, the refusal to grant bail was not sustainable. The same principles\napply regarding the apprehension of repetition of offence, namely, that bail\ncan only be refused on such ground if the apprehension is grounded on\ncogent reasons and material available on record. Reliance in this regard\ncan be placed on Muhammad Tanveer (supra). Such interpretation finds\n\nsupport from trite law namely, that discretion in bail matters should be\n\n11\nCrl. P.170-L/2025\n\nexercised on the basis of sound judicial considerations, in conformity with\nstatutory parameters, as affirmed in Muhammad Aurangzeb v. Karim\nKhan and Others (2022 SCMR 849).\n\n15. Coming to the instant case, the contents of the FIR clearly state that\nall the vehicles in question were given by the complainant to the petitioner\nin pursuance of successive business transactions. The complainant not\nonly settled the price of the vehicles with the petitioner but also received\npartial payments in lieu of the said transactions. In this eventuality and\nin light of the above discussed law, it is quite clear that there was no\nentrustment of the vehicles as trust (amanat) to the petitioner by the\ncomplainant. In absence of any such entrustment, offence under section\n405 P.P.C, is not made out and resultantly, section 406 P.P.C is not\napplicable in the present case. The contention of the learned counsel of\nthe complainant that the FIR explicitly stated the vehicles were given as a\ntrust (amanat) is of no avail because as per the dictum of Miraj Khan v.\nGul Ahmed (2000 SCMR 122), mere mentioning the word ‘trust’ in an FIR\ndoes not per se establish criminal breach of trust, and the said offence can\nonly be made out when the requisite elements of the offence stand fulfilled.\nSimilarly, in Imtiaz Ali v. Bismillah Khan and Another (1974 PCrLJN\n22 Karachi), it was held that mere mention of word ‘amanat’ cannot change\na transaction like business loan into a trust. Therefore, the mere use of\nexpressions such as \"trust\" or \"amanat\" within the context of business\ntransactions does not, by itself, amount to an act of entrustment so as to\nattract the offence of criminal breach of trust. The offence can only be said\nto be made out when both of its essential elements are clearly present and\nestablished. Additionally, the offence under section 406 P.P.C does not fall\nwithin the prohibitory clause of section 497(1), and the above discussed\nlaw clearly stipulates that grant of bail in such cases is a rule and refusal\nan exception. The case of the petitioner does not fall in any of the\nexceptions mentioned in Tariq Bashir (supra). The view taken by the\nLearned High Court in the impugned judgment that the petitioner cannot\nbe granted bail because he is nominated in three other FIRs is misplaced,\nbecause as discussed above, only previous conviction can furnish a\n\nground for refusal of bail.\n\n16. We have also observed that none of the vehicles in question here,\n\nhave been recovered from the petitioner and that the complainant lodged\n\n12\nCrl. P.170-L/2025\n\nthe FIR after a considerable delay of 5 months, without any explanation.\nDue to above reasons, case of petitioner also calls for further inquiry,\nfalling under sub-section (2) of section 497 Cr.P.C. The petitioner is also\n\nentitled for bail after-arrest on this ground.\n\n17. Before parting with this judgment, we deem it necessary to record\nour deep concern over two unfortunate matters that have come to our\nnotice in the proceedings of this case, Firstly, we have noticed that there\nis a disturbing pattern of misconstruction and misapplication of section\n405 P.P.C. The offence of criminal breach of trust is increasingly being\ninvoked in circumstances that are purely civil in nature, such as, business\ndisputes. Instead of resorting to appropriate civil remedies, litigants seek\nto initiate criminal proceedings merely to expedite the recovery of lost\nmoney or to exert undue pressure on the opposing party. This practice is\nwholly against the established scheme of criminal and civil law. Matters\nthat are inherently civil in nature, such as those involving contractual\ndisputes or monetary claims cannot be misinterpreted or deliberately\nconverted into criminal cases for the purpose of gaining revenge, coercing\nsettlements, or recovering financial losses. Such abuse of criminal law not\nonly undermines the sanctity of civil remedies but also clogs the criminal\njustice system by diverting precious judicial resources, and exposing\nindividuals to unwarranted criminal proceedings, which often culminate\nin grave miscarriages of justice. It is the duty of Courts to remain vigilant\nto prevent any misuse or misapplication of law. While dealing with cases\nof criminal breach of trust, Courts must carefully scrutinize the case to\ndetermine if the two requisite elements of the offence are fulfilled, and\nwhere such elements are not present, Courts must judicially and liberally\nexercise their discretion in grant of bail. This, however, does not imply that\ncourts should indiscriminately grant bail in every matter where a civil\nelement is apparent. Rather, it underscores the obligation of courts to\ncarefully examine whether the statutory ingredients of the alleged offence\nare duly satisfied and established on the record before allowing the\ncriminal process to proceed. This duty assumes greater significance at the\nbail stage, as the fundamental right of liberty of citizens is directly under\nquestion at that stage. It would be a grave miscarriage of justice to confine\na person to jail for an offence that is not prima facie made out in the first\nplace. It is imperative that this duty is to be discharged at the very first\n\nforum of bail, namely, by magisterial courts.\n\n13\nCrl. P.170-L/2025\n\n18. This brings us to the second matter, which is one of even greater\nimportance. We have observed with extreme disappointment that courts\nof first instance repeatedly fail to adhere to and apply the clear principles\nestablished by this Court in the Tariq Bashir case (supra). This blatant\ndisregard of judicial precedent is not only highly prejudicial for\nhierarchical structure of judicial authority, but is also contrary to the\nConstitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. Where this court\ndeliberately and with the intention of settling the law, pronounces upon a\nquestion, then such pronouncement is law within the meaning of Article\n189 of the Constitution, which stipulates that precedent established by\nthis Court is binding upon all subordinate courts. Therefore, the law\npronounced therein cannot be treated as mere obiter dictum. For\nelaboration, reference in this regard can be made to cases reported as\nJustice Khurshid Anwar Bhinder v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD 2010\nSC 483) and Allied Bank Limited v. Habib-ur-Rehman (2023 SCMR\n1232). Exercise of discretion by subordinate courts regarding the\napplication of binding precedent is completely impermissible and amounts\nto a grave dereliction of judicial duty. The disregard of binding precedent\nin matters of bail, especially where liberty is at stake, is wholly\nunacceptable and borders on judicial indiscipline. Lower courts are not at\nliberty to pick and choose which judgments of the Supreme Court to follow.\nAs such, courts of first instance are bound to apply the principles laid\ndown in the Tariq Bashir case (supra) while deciding bail applications in\ncases of offences that do not fall within the prohibitory clause of Section\n497(1) Cr.P.C., and in such cases, bail must be granted as a rule and\nrefused only in exceptional circumstances. In view of the principles of law\nenunciated above and the directions issued herein, we consider it\nappropriate to direct the Office to send a copy of this judgment to the\nRegistrars of all the High Courts who must circulate this among all District\nCourts across the country for their information and necessary guidance,\ntogether with a solemn reminder that its implementation is not optional\n\nbut mandatory under the law and the constitution.\n\n19. Foregoing are the reasons for our short order dated 18.02.2025\n\nwhich is reproduced hereunder:\n\n“For the reason to be recorded later, this petition is converted into an appeal\nand allowed. The petitioner is enlarged on bail in case FIR No.207 dated\n28.02.2022 registered under section 406 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC)\n\n14\nCrl.

The appellant before\nus was a candidate who faced defeat in the election process. He\nhad challenged Notification No.F.2(6)/2024-Cord., dated 17\" of\nFebruary, 2024, which was issued by the Election Commission of\nPakistan. This notification declared respondent No.1, Irfan Shafi\nKhokhar, the successful candidate elected to the Provincial\nAssembly from this constituency. The appellant asserted his\nchallenge based on two primary allegations. First, he claimed that\nthe consolidation of election results was conducted unfairly,\ncontending that Forms-45, which were issued to the Polling Agents,\nwere discarded with malicious intent during the process. Second,\nhe alleged that corrupt practices marred the integrity of the polling\nday itself, suggesting that these irregularities directly influenced the\nelection outcome. However, the appellant’s petition was found\nlacking in proper legal format and, as a result, was rejected by the\nElection Tribunal (the Tribunal) by a judgment rendered on 28\" of\nJanuary, 2025.\n\nC.A.202/2025 2\n\n2. The solitary question that falls for our determination is\nsimple: whether the Tribunal was justified in deciding against the\nappellant solely on the grounds of non-compliance with the\n\nprocedural requirements for filing an election petition.\n\n3. Before delving into the moot question, it is essential to\nclarify that Article 225 of the Constitution establishes a clear\nframework relating to disputes over elections to a House or a\nProvincial Assembly. Specifically, it stipulates that any challenge to\nsuch elections can only be initiated through an election petition that\nmust be submitted to a designated Tribunal, following procedures\ndetermined by the Act of Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament). The\nlegislation that operationalises this constitutional provision is the\nElections Act, 2017. This Act encompasses the entire election\nprocess, beginning with the issuance of a notification that calls\nupon a specific constituency to elect its representative(s). It extends\nthrough to the final resolution of any disputes that may arise\nregarding the election outcome. Various provisions within the\nElections Act, 2017, address different stages of this process,\nthereby creating a comprehensive legal framework governing\nelections. Consequently, it is important to note that no election to a\nHouse or a Provincial Assembly can take place except as specified\nin the Elections Act, 2017. Similarly, any challenge to such an\nelection must adhere strictly to the protocols established by this\nlegislation. The Elections Act, 2017, functions as a fully self-\ncontained code, meaning that any assertions or claims about\nelections or electoral disputes must be within its provisions. This\nframework implies that the right to contest an election is not\ninherent but is instead a construct of statute and is, consequently,\nsubject to specific statutory limitations. An election petition, as\ndefined under the Act, constitutes a statutory procedure where\nstandard principles of equity and common law do not apply; rather,\nthe process is governed exclusively by the rules and regulations set\nforth within the statute itself. Moreover, the jurisdiction exercised in\nmatters of election disputes is both unique and _ restricted,\nnecessitating strict adherence to the statutory guidelines that\nestablish it. As such, when examining the trial of election disputes,\nthe Tribunal operates within a defined framework that restricts its\n\nflexibility, as it must comply with the explicit dictates of the Elections\n\nC.A.202/2025 3\n\nAct, 2017. In light of this context, we proceed to assess whether the\nelection petition filed by the appellant aligned with the requirements\nlaid out in the Elections Act, 2017.\n\n4. The objection raised regarding the appellant’s election\npetition was rooted in the assertion that it could be subject to\ndismissal under Section 145 of the Elections Act, 2017. This\nassertion was based on the appellant’s failure to comply with the\nverification procedures explicitly mandated by the Code of Civil\nProcedure, 1908 (Act V of 1908). It is now well recognised that the\nverification of an election petition is a fundamental requirement as\nstipulated in sub-section (4) of Section 144 of the Elections Act,\n2017. Such verification must be conducted in accordance with the\ndetailed processes outlined in Order VI Rule 15 of the Code of Civil\nProcedure, 1908 (CPC). It is important to emphasise that, under the\nElections Act of 2017, verifying an election petition though requires\nthe submission of an oath that aligns with civil law; this process\ncarries significant penal consequences. The oath serves as a vital\nelement in the validation of an election petition. There are several\ncritical reasons for this: first, it serves to establish accountability for\nthe statements and claims made within the petition, binding the\nindividual who signs the verification to the accuracy and\ntruthfulness of the contents. Second, it aims to deter the\nsubmission of baseless and reckless allegations that lack factual\nsubstantiation. Third, the success of a candidate who has been\nelected should not be overturned lightly, as such actions could\nundermine the democratic process. Fourth, nullifying an election\ncarries serious implications not only for the elected representatives\nand their constituency but also for the broader public, particularly\nsince conducting a re-election involves substantial expenditures\nfrom public funds and administrative resources. Fifth, the\nintroduction of false claims not only burdens the Tribunal with\nunnecessary work, consuming time that could be dedicated to\ngenuine cases, but also obstructs those who truly seek justice\nthrough the legal system. The law, therefore, mandates that parties\napproaching the Tribunal do so with legitimate grievances\ngrounded in factual truth. When false information is presented\nunder oath, or when deceptive evidence is submitted in an attempt\n\nto mislead the Tribunal and challenge the electoral verdict, such\n\nC.A.202/2025 4\n\nmisconduct is treated with utmost seriousness. Consequently, the\nrequirement of verification on oath is not merely procedural; it is\ncompulsory. This verification process mustn't be treated as a\nroutine formality by the deponent. Instead, as a solemn declaration,\nit must be formally attested by an Oath Commissioner or any\nauthorised officer who is competent to administer oaths under\nsection 139 CPC, ensuring that the Oath has been correctly,\nphysically, and authentically administered to the election petitioner\nor deponent. This meticulous process not only upholds the integrity\nof the electoral system but also reinforces the seriousness of the\n\nclaims being made.\n\n5. The mode and manner of the attestation of the\nverification by the Oath Commissioner have been clearly\nestablished by this Court in numerous cases’. Among the essential\nrequirements for valid attestation of the verification are the\nfollowing: (i) it must explicitly state the date and place of its making,\nensuring that the context of its execution is clear’; (ii) it must clearly\nindicate the presence of the election petitioner before the Oath\nCommissioner, affirming that the deponent was physically present\nduring the attestation process*; and (iii) the identification of the\nelection petitioner must be accurately referenced, in particular by\nusing their Computerized National Identity Card, providing a reliable\nmeans of confirming their identity*. These requirements are not\nmere formalities; rather, they are mandatory in nature, as non-\ncompliance entails penal consequences including rejection of the\nelection petition, reflecting the binding legislative intent that a\n\nstatutory act must be performed strictly in the prescribed manner.®\n\n‘ Zafar Abbas v.

            "CleanedText": "JUDGMENT Shahid Waheed, J: This case centres around an electoral matter involving the contest for a seat in the Provincial Assembly of Punjab from the constituency PP-167 Lahore-XxXIll . The appellant before us was a candidate who faced defeat in the election process. He had challenged Notification No.F.2 6 /2024-Cord., dated 17 of February, 2024, which was issued by the Election Commission of Pakistan. This notification declared respondent No.1, Irfan Shafi Khokhar, the successful candidate elected to the Provincial Assembly from this constituency. The appellant asserted his challenge based on two primary allegations. First, he claimed that the consolidation of election results was conducted unfairly, contending that Forms-45, which were issued to the Polling Agents, were discarded with malicious intent during the process. Second, he alleged that corrupt practices marred the integrity of the polling day itself, suggesting that these irregularities directly influenced the election outcome. However, the appellant s petition was found lacking in proper legal format and, as a result, was rejected by the Election Tribunal the Tribunal by a judgment rendered on 28 of January, 2025. C.A.202/2025 2 2. The solitary question that falls for our determination is simple: whether the Tribunal was justified in deciding against the appellant solely on the grounds of non-compliance with the procedural requirements for filing an election petition. 3. Before delving into the moot question, it is essential to clarify that Article 225 of the Constitution establishes a clear framework relating to disputes over elections to a House or a Provincial Assembly. Specifically, it stipulates that any challenge to such elections can only be initiated through an election petition that must be submitted to a designated Tribunal, following procedures determined by the Act of Majlis-e-Shoora Parliament . The legislation that operationalises this constitutional provision is the Elections Act, 2017. This Act encompasses the entire election process, beginning with the issuance of a notification that calls upon a specific constituency to elect its representative s . It extends through to the final resolution of any disputes that may arise regarding the election outcome. Various provisions within the Elections Act, 2017, address different stages of this process, thereby creating a comprehensive legal framework governing elections. Consequently, it is important to note that no election to a House or a Provincial Assembly can take place except as specified in the Elections Act, 2017. Similarly, any challenge to such an election must adhere strictly to the protocols established by this legislation. The Elections Act, 2017, functions as a fully selfcontained code, meaning that any assertions or claims about elections or electoral disputes must be within its provisions. This framework implies that the right to contest an election is not inherent but is instead a construct of statute and is, consequently, subject to specific statutory limitations. An election petition, as defined under the Act, constitutes a statutory procedure where standard principles of equity and common law do not apply; rather, the process is governed exclusively by the rules and regulations set forth within the statute itself. Moreover, the jurisdiction exercised in matters of election disputes is both unique and restricted, necessitating strict adherence to the statutory guidelines that establish it. As such, when examining the trial of election disputes, the Tribunal operates within a defined framework that restricts its flexibility, as it must comply with the explicit dictates of the Elections C.A.202/2025 3 Act, 2017. In light of this context, we proceed to assess whether the election petition filed by the appellant aligned with the requirements laid out in the Elections Act, 2017. 4. The objection raised regarding the appellant s election petition was rooted in the assertion that it could be subject to dismissal under Section 145 of the Elections Act, 2017. This assertion was based on the appellant s failure to comply with the verification procedures explicitly mandated by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 Act V of 1908 . It is now well recognised that the verification of an election petition is a fundamental requirement as stipulated in sub-section 4 of Section 144 of the Elections Act, 2017. Such verification must be conducted in accordance with the detailed processes outlined in Order VI Rule 15 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 CPC . It is important to emphasise that, under the Elections Act of 2017, verifying an election petition though requires the submission of an oath that aligns with civil law; this process carries significant penal consequences. The oath serves as a vital element in the validation of an election petition. There are several critical reasons for this: first, it serves to establish accountability for the statements and claims made within the petition, binding the individual who signs the verification to the accuracy and truthfulness of the contents. Second, it aims to deter the submission of baseless and reckless allegations that lack factual substantiation. Third, the success of a candidate who has been elected should not be overturned lightly, as such actions could undermine the democratic process. Fourth, nullifying an election carries serious implications not only for the elected representatives and their constituency but also for the broader public, particularly since conducting a re-election involves substantial expenditures from public funds and administrative resources. Fifth, the introduction of false claims not only burdens the Tribunal with unnecessary work, consuming time that could be dedicated to genuine cases, but also obstructs those who truly seek justice through the legal system. The law, therefore, mandates that parties approaching the Tribunal do so with legitimate grievances grounded in factual truth. When false information is presented under oath, or when deceptive evidence is submitted in an attempt to mislead the Tribunal and challenge the electoral verdict, such C.A.202/2025 4 misconduct is treated with utmost seriousness. Consequently, the requirement of verification on oath is not merely procedural; it is compulsory. This verification process mustn t be treated as a routine formality by the deponent. Instead, as a solemn declaration, it must be formally attested by an Oath Commissioner or any authorised officer who is competent to administer oaths under section 139 CPC, ensuring that the Oath has been correctly, physically, and authentically administered to the election petitioner or deponent. This meticulous process not only upholds the integrity of the electoral system but also reinforces the seriousness of the claims being made. 5. The mode and manner of the attestation of the verification by the Oath Commissioner have been clearly established by this Court in numerous cases . Among the essential requirements for valid attestation of the verification are the following: i it must explicitly state the date and place of its making, ensuring that the context of its execution is clear ; ii it must clearly indicate the presence of the election petitioner before the Oath Commissioner, affirming that the deponent was physically present during the attestation process ; and iii the identification of the election petitioner must be accurately referenced, in particular by using their Computerized National Identity Card, providing a reliable means of confirming their identity . These requirements are not mere formalities; rather, they are mandatory in nature, as noncompliance entails penal consequences including rejection of the election petition, reflecting the binding legislative intent that a statutory act must be performed strictly in the prescribed manner.

Considering the requirements delineated above, the attestation confirming the verification of the election petition, performed by the Oath Commissioner, has been thoroughly examined. In this particular case, the Oath Commissioner affixed his rubber stamp below the verification statement, which bears the following inscription: Declared on oath before me On 3.4.24 Mr. Ammar Bashir S/o Bashir Ahmad R/O Identified by Sd/- Muhammad Younus Malik Inam Oath Commissioner/ Advocate Lahore High Court, Lahore Notification No.65/General/X.B.9 b 1.

This ambiguity fundamentally undermines the assurance required for proper attestation of verification. Consequently, it leads to an inescapable conclusion: the verification of the election petition did not adhere to the legal standards set forth by this Court. 7. In conclusion, we hold that the Tribunal has thoroughly examined the election petition and has reached a wellfounded decision to reject it. Therefore, this appeal, lacking substantial merit and failing to present any compelling arguments, C.A.202/2025 does not warrant further consideration. Consequently, we hereby dismiss the appeal.

            "CleanedText": "ORDER SHAHID BILAL HASSAN, J. Seeking indulgence of this Court while granting leave to appeal against the order dated 04.02.2025 passed in C.R.No.342 of 2022 by the Peshawar High Court, Peshawar, the petitioner s have brought the instant petition under Article 185 3 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, 2. Facts, in concision, leading to filing of the instant petition are as such that the petitioner s instituted a suit for declaration of title germane to the disputed property, fully detailed in the plaint, on the strength of a gift deed dated 02.10.1988, purportedly executed by their predecessor in interest namely Dawai Khan and they further sought declaration of invalidity against the inheritance mutation of Dawai Khan and the inheritance mutation No.7030 by Madad Khan in favour of Mst. Nasrin Begum, which was stated to have been attested on 21.01.2014. The suit was contested by the defendant Madad Khan, whereas the remaining respondents/ defendants conceded the claim of the petitioner s by filing their respective conceding written statements. Divergence in pleadings of the parties was summed up into issues and both the contesting parties adduced and produced their evidence in pro and contra. On conclusion of trial, the trial Court vide judgment and decree dated 31.01.2019 dismissed suit of the petitioner s , which was assailed by C.P.L.A.No.287-P of 2025 2 preferring an appeal but the same resulted in dismissal vide judgment and decree dated 03.01.2022 and this scenario led the petitioner s to file revision petition before the High Court but to no avail in their favour as the same was dismissed, too through the order impugned before us. 3. Heard at length and record has been gone through. 4. It is an irony that despite being a Muslim Society, we have, out of greed, shunned the teachings of Islam especially in respect of matters of inheritance involving property/land of the deceased propositus and such designs are achieved by using a tactic as to gift, tamleek by the deceased propositus. When such situation arises and a person knocks the door of the Court in order to get his/her lawful right s /share from the legacy of propositus, the Court s have to ponder upon and plunge deep into the facts of the case, so as to fetch the truth by evaluating and scrutinizing evidence of the parties. As such, when such a transaction is put under challenge, the following principles are to be fulfilled and considered: a Beneficiary of the impugned transaction of gift/transfer of immovable property s bears the heavy onus to prove the transaction!; b The beneficiary of a gift has to plead and prove three mandatory ingredients of gift i.e. declaration/offer by the donor, acceptance of gift by the donee and delivery of possession in pursuance of the gift?; c The possession of immovable property by one of the siblings/L.Rs. to the exclusion of other legal representatives will be treated as constructive possession on behalf of all others unless proved otherwise ; 1 Muhammad Sarwar v.

Briefly stated, the petitioner along with co-accused forming an unlawful\nassembly while being armed with deadly weapon is alleged of committing\nmurder of Yasir Ali (deceased) and causing injury to Qamar Zaman (PW) as\nrecorded in FIR No. 348 of 2023 dated 16.05.2023 at 2:45PM.

We noticed from record that another report of the same occurrence has\nbeen registered by Hassan Akhtar (accused of FIR No. 348 ibid), also\nincluding the same place, time and date of occurrence, while involving the\nsame parties inter se. However, this second report was registered on\n21.05.2023, with a delay of four days. From one side deceased, Yasir Malik\nhas lost his life and Qamar Zaman sustained injuries while in the second\nreport two persons namely Hassan Akhtar and Wagar Khalid Qureshi\n\nsustained injuries.\n\n5. When both versions are placed in juxtaposition, it becomes apparent that\nthe allegations in both complaints are qua the same incident, as they share a\ncommon nexus in terms of date, time, location, motive, and parties involved.\nThe only apparent distinction lies in the sequence of reporting.

The reason being that in cases involving cross-versions of the same\noccurrence, it is a well-settled principle of criminal jurisprudence that the\nprime consideration before the Court is to ascertain which party was the\naggressor and which party was aggressed upon. The nature, seat, and number\nof injuries sustained by each side may undoubtedly be relevant; however,\nsuch factors are merely indicative and do not, by themselves, carry an\noverriding or conclusive effect. The mere extent of injuries caused to one\nparty cannot serve as the sole basis for drawing an adverse inference against\nthe other, especially where both versions emanate from the same transaction\n\nand each party attributes aggression to the other.\n\n6. Incases of counter versions arising from the same incident, one given by\nthe complainant in the F..R., and the other given by the opposite party, bail\nin appropriate cases is granted as a rule on the grounds of further inquiry for\nthe reason that the question as to which version is correct is to be decided\nafter the recording of pro and contra evidence during the trial, and also to\nascertain which party was the aggressor and which party was aggressed upon.\n\nThe refusal of bail in such cases is an exception. Reliance is placed upon\n\nFazal Muhammad v. Ali Ahmed 1976 SCMR 391; Shafigan_v. Hashim Ali\n1972 SCMR_ 682: Khalid Mehmood _v. Muhammad Kashif Rasool 2013\n\nSCMR 1415: and Khizar Hayat v.

Additionally, the petitioner is in custody for the fast 23 months, and\ndespite the lapse of such a considerable period, there appears to be no\nsubstantial progress in the trial pending before the learned trial court. This\nprolonged incarceration, without meaningful advancement in the trial, raises a\n\nserious concern regarding the petitioner’s right to a fair and expeditious trial.\n\n8. In view of the overall circumstances of the given case, we are unable to\ndiscern any compelling reason that would justify the continued denial of bail\nto the petitioner at this stage. This petition, therefore, is converted into an\nappeal and is allowed. The petitioner is granted post arrest bail on furnishing\nsurety bond in sum of Rs. 5,00,000/-with two separate sureties in like amount\n\nto satisfaction of the concerned Trial Court.\n\nAnnounced in Open Court at Islamabad on Sana taal 2025\n\nApproved for reporting.\n\nM.Siraj Afridi PS / Tayyaba Munir LC",

Additionally, the petitioner is in custody for the fast 23 months, and despite the lapse of such a considerable period, there appears to be no substantial progress in the trial pending before the learned trial court. This prolonged incarceration, without meaningful advancement in the trial, raises a serious concern regarding the petitioner s right to a fair and expeditious trial. 8. In view of the overall circumstances of the given case, we are unable to discern any compelling reason that would justify the continued denial of bail to the petitioner at this stage. This petition, therefore, is converted into an appeal and is allowed. The petitioner is granted post arrest bail on furnishing surety bond in sum of Rs. 5,00,000/-with two separate sureties in like amount to satisfaction of the concerned Trial Court.

                "Briefly stated, the petitioner along with co-accused forming an unlawful assembly while being armed with deadly weapon is alleged of committing murder of Yasir Ali deceased and causing injury to Qamar Zaman PW as recorded in FIR No. 348 of 2023 dated 16.05.2023 at 2:45PM.",
                "The occurrence is stated to have taken place over a land dispute being the motive.",
                "The matter has been thoroughly heard and the record has been perused.",
                "We noticed from record that another report of the same occurrence has been registered by Hassan Akhtar accused of FIR No. 348 ibid , also including the same place, time and date of occurrence, while involving the same parties inter se.",
                "However, this second report was registered on 21.05.2023, with a delay of four days.",

                "The only apparent distinction lies in the sequence of reporting.",
                "This factual overlap, prima facie, reflects that the two versions are antithetical claims arising out of one and the same occurrence thus, portraying the current scenario as cross version and we are not in agreement with the Hon ble Lahore Court on not allowing bail to the petitioner on the basis of crossversion.",
                "The reason being that in cases involving cross-versions of the same occurrence, it is a well-settled principle of criminal jurisprudence that the prime consideration before the Court is to ascertain which party was the aggressor and which party was aggressed upon.",
                "The nature, seat, and number of injuries sustained by each side may undoubtedly be relevant; however, such factors are merely indicative and do not, by themselves, carry an overriding or conclusive effect.",
                "The mere extent of injuries caused to one party cannot serve as the sole basis for drawing an adverse inference against the other, especially where both versions emanate from the same transaction and each party attributes aggression to the other.",
                "Incases of counter versions arising from the same incident, one given by the complainant in the F..R., and the other given by the opposite party, bail in appropriate cases is granted as a rule on the grounds of further inquiry for the reason that the question as to which version is correct is to be decided after the recording of pro and contra evidence during the trial, and also to ascertain which party was the aggressor and which party was aggressed upon.",

The impugned judgment also cited\nsome orders passed by this Court in CPLA No.745-K to 750-K of\n2022 and Civil Petitions No.966-K to 971-K of 2022 regarding\nappointments under the aforesaid quota. Moreover, the learned\nHigh Court, in the impugned judgment, also highlighted the\nnucleus of the district-wise reports submitted by the Deputy\nCommissioners of various districts of the Province of Sindh for\nshowing compliance with the Court’s directions vis-d-vis vacant\npositions and each report was discussed individually and\ncomprehensively. Taking these reports into account, the learned\nHigh Court further directed that the joining reports of the\ndifferently-abled persons be submitted without delay. All\nDeputy Commissioners were also directed to promptly obtain\ndetails of vacant posts from the remaining departments to\nensure that a complete and accurate count of vacancies is\nidentified and submitted to the High Court so that the\nremaining petitioners could be appointed forthwith. The\nAdditional Registrar of the High Court was also directed to\ncollect the latest vacancy position for the differently-abled\npersons’ quota across all departments where the Deputy\nCommissioners serve as Chairmen of the Recruitment/Selection\nCommittees. Last but not least, by means of Paragraph No.26,\nall the constitution petitions were disposed of in the following\n\nterms:\n\n26. Under these circumstances, we hereby dispose of\nthe captioned petitions and all pending applications\nwith the directions that all Deputy Commissioners\nshould conduct regular District Recruitment\nCommittees (DRCs) and ensure immediate appointment\nof all remaining petitioners. Furthermore, compliance\nreports of the separate directions given to each and\nevery Deputy Commissioner in the above paragraphs be\nsubmitted fortnightly to the Additional Registrar of this\nCourt, who will place the same before the Bench for\nreview in chambers. All the learned Counsel\nrepresenting the petitioners are directed to submit list\nof petitioners/differently abled persons, who are still\nnot recommended, before the office of Additional\nRegistrar of this Court so that compliance be made in\nletter and spirit. Office to send copies of memos of\ncaptioned petitions to concerned Deputy\nCommissioners concerned, who have not yet been\nsupplied the same. The Deputy Commissioners are\nhereby cautioned that any appointment made without\n\nC.P.No.220-K to 442-K of 2025 -7-\n\nthe inclusion of the Petitioners) who are differently-\nabled persons, shall not be accepted, and will be\nsubject to legal scrutiny and action, Additional\nRegistrar of this Court to ensure compliance of\ndirections contained in this order in letter and spirit till\nremaining petitioners are accommodated.\n\n3. To begin with, the learned AAG duly assisted by Mr. Bhuro\nMal, Additional Director (Law), SGA&CD, argued that the\napplications for recruitment of differently-abled persons are\nconsidered strictly under the provisions of the Sindh\nEmpowerment of ‘Persons with Disabilities’ Act, 2018 (“2018\nAct”). At one fell swoop, he also called our attention to Rule 5 of\nthe Sindh Civil Servants (Appointment, Promotion & Transfer)\nRules, 1974, and argued that appointments in BS-1 to BS-15\nare to be made according to this Rule, including for\ndisabled/differently-abled persons under the 2018 Act. He\nfurther emphasized the proviso of Section 5 of the Sindh Civil\nServants Act, 1973, and argued that earlier, a 2% quota was\nallocated for the disabled persons as defined in the Disabled\nPersons (Employment/Rehabilitation) Ordinance, 1981, but\nthis 2% quota has been raised to 5%, and this increased quota\nis being followed religiously, and there is no bone of contention\nin this regard in the impugned judgment, except for certain\nobservations in the climax of paragraph 26, which seemingly\nperturbed and created some complexities for the petitioners.\nFor ease of reference, the alleged demurred portion is\n\nreproduced as under:-\n\n“The Deputy Commissioners are hereby cautioned that\nany appointment made without the inclusion of the\nPetitioners, who are differently abled persons, shall not\nbe accepted, and will be subject to legal scrutiny and\naction. Additional Registrar of this Court to ensure\ncompliance of directions contained in this order in letter\nand spirit till remaining petitioners are accommodated.”\n\n4. The learned counsel appearing for the respondents in some\ncivil petitions fully supported the impugned judgment of the\nHigh Court and argued that since the Government of Sindh\nfailed to abide by the law and, despite various directions, the\nappointments were not made, hence the learned High Court\nsimply directed compliance with the law and its strict\n\nimplementation.\n\nC.P.No.220-K to 442-K of 2025 -8-\n\n5. Heard the arguments. The State is obliged under Article 3 of\nthe Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973\n(“Constitution”) to ensure the elimination of all forms of\nexploitation and work towards the gradual fulfillment of the\nfundamental principle of “from each according to his ability, to\neach according to his work”. The foremost objective of all laws\nin our country related to disabled/differently-abled persons is\nto protect and safeguard their rights, including provisions for\nemployment commensurate with their capabilities and\ncapacities to work. Furthermore, if we examine the principal\nobjective of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of\nPersons with Disabilities, 2006 (“UN Convention”), it inter alia\nenvisions the promotion and protection of the full and equal\nenjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all\npersons with disabilities, along with respect for their inherent\ndignity. Persons with disabilities include those who have long-\nterm physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments\nwhich, in interaction with various barriers, may hinder their\nfull and effective participation in society on an equal basis with\nothers. Discrimination on the basis of disability means any\ndistinction, exclusion, or restriction that impairs or nullifies the\nrecognition, enjoyment, or exercise of all human rights and\nfundamental freedoms on an equal basis in the political,\neconomic, social, cultural, civil, or any other field. Article 27 of\nthe UN Convention, which pertains to “Work and employment\n\n?\n\non an equal basis,” includes the right to gain a living through\nwork freely chosen or accepted in a labour market and work\nenvironment that is open, inclusive, and accessible to persons\nwith disabilities. It also prohibits the discrimination on the\nbasis of disability in all matters concerning employment,\nincluding conditions of recruitment, hiring, continuance of\nemployment, career advancement, and safe and healthy\n\nworking conditions (Ref: Chairman, NADRA, & others versus Abdul\n\nMajeed & another (2025 SCP 30), [authored by one of us}).\n\n6. According to Article 25 of the Constitution, all citizens are\nequal before the law and are entitled to equal protection of the\nlaw, and there shall be no discrimination on the basis of sex.\nThe catchphrase “equal laws” emphasizes that there should be\n\nno discrimination between individuals in the context of law and\n\nC.P.No.220-K to 442-K of 2025 -9-\n\npolicy if both are evidently on the same footing. Our\nconstitution does not only command equality but also\nsafeguards and guarantees equal opportunity among the\npersons within the same class or genre, without illogical\ndistinctions or partialities. Article 4 of the Constitution\nencompasses the doctrine of equality before the law and equal\nprotection, ensuring that no action detrimental to a person’s\nlife, liberty, body, reputation, or property can be taken except in\naccordance with the law. The Objectives Resolution, made a\nsubstantive part of the Constitution by virtue of Article 2-A,\nunequivocally enjoins that the principles of equality, social\njustice, and economic justice, as enunciated by Islam, will be\nfully observed and guaranteed as fundamental rights.\nFurthermore, the Principles of Policy contained in Article 38 of\nthe Constitution also provide that the State should secure the\nwell-being of the people by raising their standards of living,\nensuring an equitable adjustment of rights between employers\nand employees, and providing for all citizens, within the\navailable resources of the country, facilities for work and\nadequate livelihood, while reducing income disparities among\n\nindividuals.\n\n7. The preamble of the 2018 Act clearly demonstrates and\nintelligibly epitomizes that it was promulgated to give effect to\nthe UN Convention and for matters connected therewith or\nincidental thereto. The United Nations General Assembly\nadopted this Convention on the 13th of December, 2006, laying\ndown the following principles for the empowerment of persons\nwith disabilities: (a) respect for inherent dignity, individual\nautonomy including the freedom to make one’s own choices,\nand independence of persons; (b) non-discrimination; (c) full\nand effective participation and inclusion in society; (d) respect\nfor difference and acceptance of ‘Persons with Disabilities’ as\npart of human diversity and humanity; (e) equality of\nopportunity; (f) accessibility; (g) equality between men and\nwomen; (h) respect for the evolving capacities of children with\ndisabilities and respect for the right of children with disabilities\nto preserve their identities. According to the 2018 Act, the\nIslamic Republic of Pakistan ratified the UN Convention on 25th\n\nOctober, 2011. Since it is now a provincial subject, the\n\nC.P.No.220-K to 442-K of 2025 -10-\n\nProvincial Assembly of Sindh, in an effort to promote and\nensure full and effective inclusion of persons with disabilities in\nthe community, promulgated the 2018 Act with an institutional\nframework to protect their rights, in general, and in particular,\nto align with the UN Convention by ensuring meaningful and\neffective access to various physical and intangible resources\ntailored to fulfill the special needs of persons with disabilities.\nAs per Section 2 (h) (Definitions Clause), “Disabilities / Specified\ndisabilities” refers to the disabilities specified in the Schedule.\nThe Schedule appended to the Act in extenso delineates the\ndescription/categories under distinct heads, such as: Physical\ndisabilities, Neuro-Developmental Disorders, Disabilities caused\ndue to chronic neurological conditions, Multiple Disabilities i.e.,\nmore than one of the above specified disabilities causing severe\ncommunication, developmental, social and _ educational\nproblems), and any other category as may be notified by the\nGovernment (not otherwise specified). Additionally, Section 25\nof the 2018 Act provides a guiding principle and procedure,\nincluding a right of appeal for an aggrieved person for\n“Certification of Persons with Disabilities”, under which the\nGovernment is obligated to designate ‘District Committees’, in\neach district of Sindh, compose of persons with the requisite\nqualifications, experience, and competency to assess the extent\n\nof specified disabilities in individuals.\n\n8. In compliance with the command and reign of Section 3 of\nthe 2018 Act, it is inter alia provided that the Government shall\nensure that every person with disabilities has the right to be\nrespected for his/her individual dignity and to lead a decent life\nwith equal opportunities, including access to education, skills\ntraining, and _ rehabilitation services, to ensure _ their\nparticipation in educational, social, economic, cultural, and all\nother activities in society without discrimination. The\nGovernment must further ensure that the persons with\ndisabilities are treated equally, and at par with persons without\nsuch disabilities, in all public facilities and services and public\nbuildings, and that they are not discriminated against in the\nexercise of their rights. Under Section 11 of the 2018 Act, the\nGovernment is duty-bound to formulate schemes and\n\nprograms, including the provision of loans at concessional rates\n\nC.P.No.220-K to 442-K of 2025 -11-\n\nto facilitate and support the employment of persons with\ndisabilities. These measures include: (a) inclusion of persons\nwith disabilities in all mainstream formal and non-formal\nvocational and skill training schemes and programs; (b)\nensuring that a person with disabilities has adequate support\nand facilities to avail specific training; (c) exclusive skill training\nprograms for persons with disabilities with active links with the\nmarket, for those with developmental, intellectual, multiple\ndisabilities and autism; (d) loans at concessional rates\nincluding that of microcredit; (e) marketing of the products\nmade by persons with disabilities; and (f) maintenance of\ndisaggregated data on the progress made in the skill training\nand self-employment by the persons with disabilities, with a\nfurther rider that no Government establishment shall\ndiscriminate against any person with disabilities in any matter\nrelating to employment; provided that the Government may,\nhaving regard to the type of work carried on in any\nestablishment, by notification and subject to such conditions, if\nany, exempt any establishment from the provisions of this sub\nsection and no establishment, whether public or private, shall\ndiscriminate against a person on the ground of disabilities in\nthe matters of employment, promotion, career development and\nenjoying fruits of his/her employment and every establishment\nshall notify equal opportunity policy detailing measures\nproposed to be taken by it in pursuance of the provisions of this\nSection in the manner as may be prescribed by the Government\nand shall maintain records of the persons with disabilities in\nrelation to the matter of employment, facilities provided and\nother necessary information in compliance with the provisions\nof this section in such form and manner as may be prescribed\nby the Authority for the Empowerment of ‘Persons with\nDisabilities’, Government of Sindh, established under Section\n\n28 of the 2018 Act.\n\n9. Obviously, the 2018 Act is beneficial legislation enacted for\nthe empowerment of persons with disabilities, focused on a\nparticular subject. Therefore, this law ought to be enforced and\nimplemented in letter and spirit across the board without any\nbias and discrimination. Mere legislation is not sufficient, nor\n\ndoes it serve any purpose unless it is specifically enforced and\n\nC.P.No.220-K to 442-K of 2025 -12-\n\nadministered. Implementing and enforcing laws in the right\ndimensions represent the unfeigned strategy through which\ngovernment authorities put the laws into action for effective and\nmeaningful compliance under their beneficiaries. The effectual\nand proficient implementation of the law is not only essential\nfor maintaining order, but it also guarantees justice,\nevenhandedness, and equality in society with impartiality.\nContemporaneously, the tool of judicial review is also a\nsignificant modus operandi that authorizes the courts to dwell\non legislative competence, the constitutionality of law, and\nexecutive actions, to analyze whether the law aligns with\nconstitutional mandates and whether its implementation is fair\nand just, without any arbitrariness or discrimination. This is\nnecessary for safeguarding and upholding the rights of people\n\nas a key element in strengthening the rule of law.\n\n10. After due deliberation, what we comprehend is that the\nlearned High Court, in fact, recapped its earlier orders passed\non 29.08.2024, 18.09.2024, 03.10.2024, 10.10.2024, and\n17.10.2024, whereby the competent authority was directed to\nconsider the cases of the respondents/petitioners for\nappointment. In the same breath, it also cited the orders passed\nby this Court in CPLAs Nos. 745-K to 750-K of 2022 and Civil\nPetitions Nos. 966-K to 971-K of 2022 for appointments on the\naforementioned quota. At the time of ensuring swift compliance\nand implementation of its own orders, the High Court austerely\ncautioned the Deputy Commissioners that any appointment\nmade without the inclusion of the respondents/petitioners, who\nare differently-abled persons, shall not be accepted and will be\nsubject to legal scrutiny and action. The Additional Registrar\nwas also called upon to ensure compliance in letter and spirit\nuntil the remaining respondents/petitioners are\naccommodated. If truth to be told, we do not find any logical\njustification to cause any interference in the impugned\njudgment merely on the foothold of the alleged or purported\nobjectionable portion highlighted by the learned Additional\nAdvocate General, Sindh, which is nothing but an amplification\nin the broader context. The learned High Court directed that all\nsuch persons who have already applied for the jobs against\n\nvacant situations should have their applications considered at\n\nC.P.No.220-K to 442-K of 2025 -13-\n\nthe outset rather than shelved or deferred under the garb or\nguise of fresh applications submitted for the same purposes by\nnew entrants. Hence, Deputy Commissioners were cautioned\nthat any appointment made without the inclusion of the\nrespondents/petitioners, who are differently-abled persons,\nshall not be accepted and will be subject to legal scrutiny and\naction. In our considered view, such observations of the High\nCourt, seems to be quite logical and do not prejudice the\ninterest of the petitioners (Government of Sindh) in any event\nbut rather serve as a guideline to ensure finality and\nconclusiveness in the recruitment process of disabled or\n\ndifferently-abled persons in accordance with the law.\n\n11. No interference is warranted in the impugned judgment;\n\ntherefore, the aforesaid Civil Petitions are disposed of\n\naccordingly.\nJudge\nJudge\nKarachi:\n20.03.2025\nKhalid\n\nApproved for reporting",

We also called upon the learned\nAttorney General to explain the procedure of calling a meeting. He\n\nreferred to Rules 9 and 10 of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan\n\nRules, 2024, and argued that before the date is fixed for any JCP\n\nmeeting, at least fifteen days’ notice is required to be issued to all\n\nmembers of the JCP for nominating the prospective candidates.\n\n6.

All\nthe petitioners, in one voice, sought the declaration in their respective\npetitions that the aforesaid notification is unconstitutional. Since the\nConstitution Petition No.22/2025 has been filed by five sitting\nHonourable Judges of the Islamabad High Court in personam against\nupsetting their original seniority reckoned before the transfer,\ntherefore, their petition will be treated as “leading petition” and the\n\nrest will proceed conjointly.\n\n2. In the preliminary arguments, Mr. Munir A. Malik, learned Sr. ASC\nrepresenting the petitioners in the leading petition, availed the first\nright of audience.

Misc. No. 10324-B/2024)\n\nMuhammad Abid Hussain Petitioner(s)\nVersus\nThe State and another Respondent(s)\nFor the Petitioner(s): Syed Rifaqat Hussain Shah, ASC/AOR\nFor the State: Rai Akhtar Hussain, Addl. PG\nDate of Hearing: 27.02.2025\nJUDGMENT\n\nMuhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, J. The petitioner while invoking the\njurisdiction of this Court under Article 185(3) of the Constitution of\nIslamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 and has questioned the order dated\n22.01.2025 of the Lahore High Court, Lahore whereby his application for\nbail after arrest in FIR No.1508/24 dated 09.12.2024 for the offence\nunder section 9(1)6(c) of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997\n(“Act of 1997”) registered at Police Station Chowk Azam, Layyah was\n\ndismissed.\n\nPN Precisely the facts necessary for the disposal of the instant bail\npetition are that allegedly, on 09.12.2024, at 04:49 p.m, upon receipt of\nspy information, the petitioner was apprehended by the police party\nwhen he was present at Chak No. 353/TDA and the complainant\nrecovered “Heroin” weighing 1100 grams, which the petitioner kept in his\npossession for the purpose of sale; hence this case.\n\n3. Syed Rifaqat Hussain Shah, learned counsel for the petitioner,\ncontended that the petitioner is innocent and has falsely been implicated\n\nCri. P. No. 146/2025. 2\n\nin the case by the police authorities on the basis of fake and fictitious\nstory; that the petitioner is behind the bars since his arrest; investigation\nhas been completed and corpus of the petitioner is no more required to\nthe police for further investigation; that no private witness was\nassociated by the local police at the time of alleged recovery which is\nclear violation of section 103 Cr.P.C; the raiding party failed to record the\nrecovery process on video despite clear and repeated directions from this\nCourt to do so; and, the petitioner is previously a non-convict, therefore,\n\nhe may be granted post arrest bail.\n\n4. On the other hand, Mr. Rai Akhter Hussain, Additional Prosecutor\nGeneral, appearing on behalf of the State opposed this petition with the\narguments that the petitioner is nominated in the FIR; that the petitioner\nwas caught red-handed at the spot and the recovery of “Heroin” has been\neffected from his possession, therefore, there is no ground for grant of\n\npost arrest bail in favour of the petitioner.\n\n5. At the very outset, it would be relevant to state that the Act of 1997\nprescribes severe punishments for the possession and sale of narcotic\nsubstances. Given the gravity of the penalties, the standard of proof\nrequired to establish guilt must be correspondingly high. The\nprosecution must demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt that the\npetitioner was in possession of narcotic substance and that it was\nintended for sale. Article 164 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984\nemphasizes the importance of modern devices and techniques in the\ncollection of evidence. It provides that evidence obtained through modern\ndevices, such as video recordings, should be given due weight in judicial\nproceedings. This provision underscores the need for law enforcing\nagencies to adopt contemporary methods to ensure the accuracy and\nreliability of evidence. In this regard, in a criminal case titled Zahid\nSarfaraz Gill v State (2024 SCMR-934), this Court had granted bail after\narrest to an accused carrying 1833 grams of charas which, as per the\ntable in section 9(1) of the Act of 1997, comes under clause (c) of its third\ncategory and prescribes a minimum imprisonment of nine years and a\nmaximum of fourteen years and fine, on the ground that why the police\n\nand members of the Anti-Narcotics Force do not record or take\n\nCri.

The petitioner while invoking the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 185 3 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 and has questioned the order dated 22.01.2025 of the Lahore High Court, Lahore whereby his application for bail after arrest in FIR No.1508/24 dated 09.12.2024 for the offence under section 9 1 6 c of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 Act of 1997 registered at Police Station Chowk Azam, Layyah was dismissed. PN Precisely the facts necessary for the disposal of the instant bail petition are that allegedly, on 09.12.2024, at 04:49 p.m, upon receipt of spy information, the petitioner was apprehended by the police party when he was present at Chak No. 353/TDA and the complainant recovered Heroin weighing 1100 grams, which the petitioner kept in his possession for the purpose of sale; hence this case. 3. Syed Rifaqat Hussain Shah, learned counsel for the petitioner, contended that the petitioner is innocent and has falsely been implicated Cri. P. No. 146/2025. 2 in the case by the police authorities on the basis of fake and fictitious story; that the petitioner is behind the bars since his arrest; investigation has been completed and corpus of the petitioner is no more required to the police for further investigation; that no private witness was associated by the local police at the time of alleged recovery which is clear violation of section 103 Cr.P.C; the raiding party failed to record the recovery process on video despite clear and repeated directions from this Court to do so; and, the petitioner is previously a non-convict, therefore, he may be granted post arrest bail. 4. On the other hand, Mr. Rai Akhter Hussain, Additional Prosecutor General, appearing on behalf of the State opposed this petition with the arguments that the petitioner is nominated in the FIR; that the petitioner was caught red-handed at the spot and the recovery of Heroin has been effected from his possession, therefore, there is no ground for grant of post arrest bail in favour of the petitioner. 5. At the very outset, it would be relevant to state that the Act of 1997 prescribes severe punishments for the possession and sale of narcotic substances. Given the gravity of the penalties, the standard of proof required to establish guilt must be correspondingly high. The prosecution must demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt that the petitioner was in possession of narcotic substance and that it was intended for sale. Article 164 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 emphasizes the importance of modern devices and techniques in the collection of evidence. It provides that evidence obtained through modern devices, such as video recordings, should be given due weight in judicial proceedings. This provision underscores the need for law enforcing agencies to adopt contemporary methods to ensure the accuracy and reliability of evidence. In this regard, in a criminal case titled Zahid Sarfaraz Gill v State 2024 SCMR-934 , this Court had granted bail after arrest to an accused carrying 1833 grams of charas which, as per the table in section 9 1 of the Act of 1997, comes under clause c of its third category and prescribes a minimum imprisonment of nine years and a maximum of fourteen years and fine, on the ground that why the police and members of the Anti-Narcotics Force do not record or take Cri.

Reg. (J), SCP.\n(The respondent/accused in person)\n\nDates of hearing: 21, 22 and 23 January 2025.\n\nORDER\n\nThe underlying facts that have given rise to an unsavoury situation are\nthat a three-member Bench of this Court (comprising Syed Mansoor Ali\nShah, Ayesha A. Malik, and Irfan Saadat Khan, JJ.) heard certain cases\n(CPLA No. 836-K of 2020, etc.) on 13 January 2025. At the outset of the\nproceedings, an objection was raised regarding the Bench’s jurisdiction to\nhear these cases, which involved a challenge to the constitutionality of a\nlaw, on the basis of Article 191A of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic\nof Pakistan (“Constitution”). After hearing arguments of the learned\ncounsel on the jurisdictional objection, the Bench adjourned the hearing\nto 16 January 2025 by allowing time to the learned counsel for the parties\nto make preparation to further assist the Court on the points concerning\nthe jurisdictional objection. The order dated 13 January 2025 is\nreproduced below:\n\nAt the very outset, the learned counsel for the petitioners submitted\nthat the present regular bench of the Court cannot hear these cases,\nas they involve a challenge to the constitutionality of a law, namely,\nsubsection (2) of Section 221-A of the Customs Act, 1969. When\nasked why this bench cannot hear these cases, the learned counsel\nreferred to the provisions of Article 191A, which was added to the\nConstitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan through the 26th\nConstitutional Amendment. In response to the petitioners’ objection\nregarding the lack of jurisdiction of the present bench of the Court,\nthe learned counsel for the respondents contended that Article\n\nCrl.0.P._ No. 1 of 2025. 2\n\n191A, the basis of the objection regarding jurisdiction, is\nconstitutionally invalid as it infringes upon the salient features of\nthe Constitution, including the independence of the judiciary and\nthe separation of powers among the three organs of the State. He\nfurther submitted that a constitutionally invalid amendment\ncannot oust the constitutionally valid conferment of jurisdiction on\nthe regular benches of the Court.\n\n2. When asked how the present bench of the Court can decide upon\nthe constitutional validity of the newly added Article 191A, the\nlearned counsel for the respondents took the position that since the\nobjection raised and the basis thereof pertain to the jurisdiction of\nthe present bench, it must be decided by it. In support of his stance,\nhe referred to Sabir Shah v. Shad Muhammad Khan (PLD 1995 SC\n66), Fazlul Quader Chowdhry v. Abdul Haque (PLD 1963 SC 486)\nand Marbury v. Madison (5 US 137 [1803]) and sought time to\nfurther assist the Court on this point.\n\n3. Given the objection raised and the reply thereto, we find that it\n\nwould be necessary to first decide upon the same before proceeding\n\nfurther in the matter at hand. Therefore, the learned counsel for the\n\nparties are granted time to prepare their arguments and assist the\n\nCourt on the said points. The hearing for arguments on those points\n\nis adjourned to 16.01.2025.\nOn 16 January 2025, the three-member Bench stood reconstituted, with\nAqeel Ahmed Abbasi, J., replacing Irfan Saadat Khan, J., and the said\ncases were posted before the reconstituted Bench. However, the\nreconstituted Bench could not proceed with the hearing, as Aqeel Ahmed\nAbbasi, J., was one of the two judges who had delivered the impugned\njudgment in these cases in the High Court of Sindh. Consequently, the\nreconstituted Bench (comprising Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Ayesha A. Malik\nand Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi, JJ.) directed the office, by its order dated 16\nJanuary 2025, to fix these cases before the earlier Bench on Monday, 20\nJanuary 2025, at 1:00 pm. The order dated 16 January 2025 is\nreproduced below for ready reference:\n\nThese cases were heard on 13.01.2025 by a bench comprising Mr.\n\nJustice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Mrs. Justice Ayesha A. Malik and\n\nMr. Justice Irfan Saadat Khan and were posted for 16.01.2025,\n\nhowever, the bench today cannot hear this matter, as the impugned\n\njudgment has been authored by one of us (Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi, J.).\n\nConsidering that it was a part heard matter, let these cases be\n\nposted for 20.01.2025 at 01:00 p.m. before the same bench\n\ncomprising Mr. Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Mrs. Justice Ayesha\n\nA. Malik and Mr. Justice Irfan Saadat Khan. Notice shall also be\n\nissued to the Attorney General for Pakistan under Order XXVII-A of\n\nthe Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (“CPC”).\nOn 20 January 2025, Mr. Salahuddin, ASC (counsel for one of the\nrespondents in the said cases), appeared before the Bench (comprising\nSyed Mansoor Ali Shah, Ayesha A. Malik, and Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi, JJ.)\n\nthat had passed the aforementioned order and pointed out that the cases\n\nCrl.0.P._ No. 1 of 2025. 3\n\nhad not been fixed for hearing as per the court order dated 16 January\n2025. The Bench called for the Additional Registrar (Judicial); however,\ndue to his unavailability, the Deputy Registrar (Judicial) appeared. The\nDeputy Registrar confirmed that the cases had not been fixed on that day,\ni.e., 20 January 2025 before any regular Bench but had instead been fixed\nfor hearing before the Constitutional Bench on 27 January 2025, pursuant\nto the decision of the Committee constituted under the Supreme Court\n(Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023 (“Act”). He further submitted that the\ndecision of the Committee had not yet been communicated to the office, in\nwriting. Upon receiving information of these facts, the said Bench initiated\nsuo motu contempt proceedings against the Additional Registrar (Judicial)\nfor defiance of the court order and for obstructing the administration of\njustice. The Bench, while calling for his explanation, fixed the hearing of\nthe contempt proceedings for 21 January 2025 by its order dated 20\nJanuary 2025. Relevant paragraphs 4 and 5 of the order dated 20 January\n2025 are reproduced below:\n\n4. It is a sad state of affairs that a judicial order of this Court\nhas been ignored by the office and the cases put up before the\nCommittee for a decision, despite the precedents of this Court to\nthe contrary reported as Asad Ali v. Federation of Pakistan (1998\nSCMR 15), Asad Ali v. Federation of Pakistan (1998 SCMR 130) and\nHuman Rights Case No.14959-K of 2018 (PLD 2019 SC 183). The\ndefiance of the judicial order of this Court lowers the dignity and\nhonour of this Court and hamper the administration of justice. In\nthis background, let notice be issued to the Additional Registrar\n(Judicial) of this Court as to why contempt proceedings may not be\ninitiated against him.\n\n5. Office shall number this petition and fix it for hearing before\nus tomorrow i.e., 21.01.2025, when the additional Registrar\n(Judicial) shall appear in person with the explanation as to why the\nabove-mentioned cases have not been fixed before the Bench today.\n\nOn 21 January 2025, the Bench that had passed the aforementioned order\nwas reconstituted, excluding Ayesha A. Malik, J., from the Bench, and the\nsuo motu contempt proceeding was listed before this reconstituted two-\nmember Bench (comprising Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Aqeel Ahmed\nAbbasi, JJ.).\n\n2. On 21 January 2025, in response to the notice issued to the\nAdditional Registrar (Judicial) of this Court, the Registrar of the Court\nappeared on behalf of the Additional Registrar (Judicial), who was reported\nto be indisposed. The Registrar presented copies of two decisions made by\ntwo different Committees: first, the decision of the Committee constituted\n\nunder Section 2 of the Act; and second, the decision of the Committee\n\nCrl.0.P._ No. 1 of 2025. 4\n\nconstituted under Article 191A of the Constitution. He stated that the\nCommittee constituted under Section 2 of the Act convened its meeting on\n17 January 2025 and, by a majority decision, resolved to “withdraw” the\nsaid cases from the regular Bench and refer them to the Committee\nestablished under Article 191A of the Constitution. Subsequently, the\nlatter Committee convened its meeting on the same date, i.e., 17 January\n2025, and directed that all cases challenging the vires of the 26th\nConstitutional Amendment and vires of law be fixed for hearing before the\nConstitutional Bench on 27 January 2025. He explained that, because of\nthese decisions by the two Committees, the said cases were not fixed by\nthe office for hearing on 20 January 2025 before the regular Bench. The\nexplanation provided by the Registrar, coupled with the contention raised\nby Mr. Salahuddin, ASC (counsel for one of the respondents in the said\ncases), gave rise to the following substantial questions of law of public\nimportance:\n\n(i) Whether the Committees constituted under Section 2 of the Act\nand Article 191A of the Constitution have the authority to\nwithdraw a case [from a Bench], in which cognisance has already\nbeen taken by a regular Bench and serious questions of\nconstitutional law relating to the jurisdiction of the regular Bench\nhave been framed; and\n\n(ii) Whether the said Committees can, by an administrative order,\nundo the effect of a judicial order, whereby next date of hearing\n\na specific case has been fixed before a regular Bench [to hear\narguments on the jurisdiction of the regular Bench].\n\nThe Court observed that “[uJnder Article 190 of the Constitution, all\nexecutive and judicial authorities throughout Pakistan, including officers\nwithin the establishment of this Court, are required to act in aid of the\nSupreme Court, meaning in aid of its judicial orders, not administrative\norders. Furthermore, in accordance with the constitutional mandate of\nArticle 5 of the Constitution, every citizen, including officers within the\nestablishment of this Court, is bound to obey the Constitution and the\nlaw. Accordingly, the legality of the explanation put forth by the Registrar,\nas well as the outcome of the present contempt proceedings, hinges upon\n\nthe determination of the aforementioned questions.”\n\n3. In light of the significance of the questions involved, the Court\nappointed Mr. Hamid Khan, Sr. ASC, and Mr. Muneer A. Malik, Sr. ASC,\nas amici curiae to assist in addressing the aforementioned questions.\nAdditionally, the Court granted permission to Mr. Shahid Jamil Khan, ASC\n\n(counsel for one of the respondents in the main cases), to assist in the\n\nCrl.0.P._ No. 1 of 2025. 5\n\nmatter. Notice was also issued to the learned Attorney-General for\nPakistan to provide assistance on the above questions. The hearing was\n\nthen adjourned to 22 January 2025 for arguments on these questions.\n\n4. On 22 January 2025, the Court heard the arguments of Mr. Shahid\nJamil Khan, ASC (counsel for one of the respondents in the main cases),\nas well as those of the learned amici curiae, Mr. Muneer A. Malik, Sr. ASC,\nand Mr. Hamid Khan, Sr. ASC. The Court also appointed two additional\namici curiae, Mr. Ahsan Bhoon, ASC, and Khawaja Haris Ahmad, ASC, to\nassist in addressing the said questions, and adjourned the hearing to 23\n\nJanuary 2025.\n\n5. On 23 January 2025, the Court heard further arguments of Mr.\nHamid Khan, Sr. ASC, the learned amicus curiae, as well as from Mr.\nSalahuddin, ASC (counsel for one of the respondents in the main cases).\nThe Court also heard the arguments of Mr. Ahsan Bhoon, ASC, and\nKhawaja Haris Ahmad, ASC, the learned amici curiae, as well as the\n\nlearned Attorney-General for Pakistan.\n\n6. On the same day, i.e., 23 January 2025, the respondent-accused,\nMr. Nazar Abbas, the Additional Registrar (Judicial), filed his written reply\n(Crl.M.A. No. 134/2025) to the show cause notice. He explained his\nposition mostly in the same terms as the explanation provided by the\nRegistrar of the Court, on his behalf on 21 January 2025, as noted above.\n\nSome relevant portions of his reply are reproduced below:\n\n1. That the answering respondent in reply to the subject Notice\nbegs to submit that the undersigned has held this Hon’ble Court in\nthe highest respect and esteem throughout his 36 long years of\nservice with unblemished service record. Accordingly, the\nundersigned cannot even imagine wilful flouting or disregarding any\norder passed by this Hon’ble Court especially on the last leg of his\nservice career which is going to end in a couple of weeks.\n\n7. That as per the Court Roster, the requisite Bench for the\npurpose of hearing CPLA No.836-K/2020 etc. was not available on\n20.01.2025, therefore, a note was initiated for constitution of\nSpecial Bench comprising Hon’ble Judges as mentioned in the\norder dated 16.01.2025, which partly heard the matter on\n13.01.2025.\n\n8. That upon perusal of the office note, the HCJ was pleased to\nplace the matter before the Committee constituted under Section\n2(1) of the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023 in the\nfollowing terms:\n\n“May be placed before the Committee tomorrow at 12\nnoon.”\n\n9. That on 17.01.2025, the Committee constituted under\nSection 2(1) of the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act,\n\nCrl.0.P._ No. 1 of 2025. 6\n\n2023 decided through majority vote that the matter be placed before\nthe Committee constituted under Article 191A(4) of the Constitution\nof Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973.\n\n10. That the Committee constituted under Article 191A(4) of the\nConstitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973 held its meeting\nat_12:45 pm on 17.01.2025 and resolved that all cases challenging\nthe 26th Constitution amendment and vires of Law be fixed before\nthe 8 members Constitutional Bench on 27.01.2025, the Court\nRoster be issued accordingly.\n\n12. That the constitution of Benches or approval of the Roster is\nbeyond the capacity as well as jurisdiction of the answering\nrespondent. The responsibility of the answering respondent at the\nmost is to apprise the Competent Authority to the non-availability\nof any appropriate bench, which has been not only conveyed before\ntime but also has been suggested to be met with by formation of\nspecial Bench so there is no lapse on the part of the answering\nrespondent in the whole scenario.\n\n13. That act of the office regarding non-fixation of the case before\nthe Bench, was neither deliberate not wilful, it was in pursuance of\nthe decisions taken by the two Committees. The answering\nrespondent initiated an office note to comply with the order of the\nCourt dated 16.01.2025 in letter and spirit by the constitution of\nthe requisite Special bench and having no intention to withhold or\ndisobey the order of the Hon’ble Court.\n\nPRAYER\n\nInspite of the above facts, the answering respondent surrenders\nhimself at the mercy of this Hon’ble Court with further prayer that\nthe Show Cause Notice dated 20.01.2025 may kindly be withdrawn\nin the interest of justice.\n\n7. We have considered the explanation provided by the respondent-\naccused in his reply to the show cause notice, as well as the arguments of\nthe learned amici curiae, the learned Attorney-General and the learned\n\ncounsel for some of the respondents in the main cases.\n\nPreliminary points regarding the jurisdiction of the Benches that\npassed the orders dated 13 and 16 January 2025\n\n8. First, we find it appropriate to address two preliminary points raised\n\nbefore us regarding the jurisdiction of the Benches that passed the orders\n\ndated 13 and 16 January 2025.\n\n9. The first point raised was that the three-member Bench, which\npassed the order dated 13 January 2025, lacked jurisdiction to hear cases\ninvolving a challenge to the constitutionality of a law, as such matters fall\nwithin the exclusive domain of the Constitutional Bench under Article\n191A of the Constitution. It was also argued that the said Bench could\nnot examine the vires of the 26th Constitutional Amendment, whereby\nArticle 191A was added to the Constitution, as this too falls within the\n\nexclusive domain of the Constitutional Bench under Article 191A.\n\nCrl.0.P._ No. 1 of 2025. 7\n\n10. The said point was also rebutted before us with the submissions\nthat the Bench which passed the order dated 13 January 2025 had not\ncommenced hearing the matter concerning the constitutionality of the law.\nInstead, it was hearing arguments on the objection raised to its jurisdiction\nto entertain such matters based on Article 191A. Furthermore, the Bench\nwas also deliberating on whether it could examine the constitutionality of\nArticle 191A itself, as the objection to its jurisdiction was rooted in that\nvery Article. Thus, the Bench was addressing the jurisdictional question\nrather than the substantive matter of the constitutionality of the law\ninvolved in the cases before it. Since Khawaja Haris Ahmad, the learned\namicus curia, has provided his written articulation on this point, we find\nit expedient to reproduce the relevant portion here:\n\nIt is noteworthy that when, on 13.01.2025, the learned Bench took\n\nup the matter relating to its jurisdiction to entertain and decide the\n\nCPLAs (filed under Article 185(3) of the Constitution) fixed before it,\n\nthis involved neither assuming jurisdiction over the merits of the\n\nCPLAs, nor decision of constitutionality of any law point involved in\n\nthe CPLAs. Rather, in effect, it only took upon itself the task of\n\nascertaining if Article 191A(3) could be so construed as to exclude\n\nthe Bench’s jurisdiction to hear the CPLAs. To do so, the learned\n\nBench was dealing with the matter like any other case where\n\nquestion of jurisdiction is raised - i.e. (i) first looking at the wording\n\nof the provision itself to see if it per se excluded the Court’s\n\njurisdiction; and, (ii) if so, to see whether the provision of law relied\n\nupon for excluding the Court’s jurisdiction constitutes valid law or\n\nnot. Thus, in the instant case, the learned Bench would first\n\nexamine the words of Article 191A(3) to ascertain if a plain reading\n\nof it excludes the Court’s jurisdiction in the matter; and, if such\n\nexclusion is a necessary consequence, then the Court would\n\nproceed to ascertain the constitutional validity of Article 191A(3).\n\nPrima facie it appears that the aforesaid exercise in not covered by\nexclusionary provisions of Article 191A(3) of the Constitution.\n\nSimilarly, Mr. Shahid Jamil Khan, ASC, adopted the same stance. In\naddition to the cases of Pir Sabir Shah,! Fazlul Quader Chowdhry?\nand Marbury? referred to by Barrister Salahuddin, he also cited extracts\nfrom Justice Fazal Karim’s Judicial Review of Public Actions (2nd Edition,\nVolume 3, pages 1403-1406), where the learned author has discussed\nseveral cases from American, English and Pakistani jurisdictions on this\n\npoint.\n\n11. The second point raised was that the three-member Bench, which\n\npassed the order dated 16 January 2025 directing the office to fix certain\n\n' Pir Sabir Shah v. Shad Muhammad Khan PLD 1995 SC 66.\n? Fazlul Quader Chowdhry v. Abdul Haque PLD 1963 SC 486.\n3 Marbury v. Madison 5 US 137 [1803].\n\nCrl.0.P._ No. 1 of 2025. 8\n\ncases before a particular Bench, acted without lawful authority, and that\nthe said order was passed in contravention of the law governing the\nconstitution of Benches and the assignment of cases. It was contended\nthat the constitution of Benches falls within the domain of the Committee\nestablished under Section 2 of the Act, whereas the assignment of cases\nto Benches is the exclusive authority of the Chief Justice of Pakistan under\nthe Supreme Court Rules, 1980. This point was also contested before us\nby referring to several precedents where Benches have issued directions\n\nfor fixing cases even before the Full Court.\n\n12. Weare afraid we cannot address or adjudicate upon the above points\nin the present contempt proceedings, as the said points raised before us\nare misplaced. This Bench is not seized with a review petition against the\norders of the three-member Benches dated 15 and 16 January 2025.\nInstead, we are only dealing with the contempt proceedings initiated for\nthe alleged non-compliance with that order. A similar point was raised\nbefore this Court during the contempt proceedings against Syed Yousaf\nRaza Gilani, the then Prime Minister of Pakistan, regarding non-\ncompliance with the directions issued in a judgment.* In that case, a\nseven-member Bench of this Court rejected the same in the following\n\nterms:\n\nThe Respondent’s stand amounts to saying that the order of this\nCourt is non-implementable, as he believes that the same is not in\naccord with the Constitution of Pakistan and the International law.\nThis argument, if accepted, would set a dangerous precedent and\nanyone would then successfully flout the orders of the Courts by\npleading that according to his interpretation they are not in accord\nwith the law. A judgment debtor would then be allowed to plead\nbefore the executing Court that the decree against him was\ninconsistent with the established law. No finality would then be\nattached to the judgments and orders of the Courts, even those by\nthe apex Court of the Country. ... The executive authority may\nquestion a Court’s decision through the judicial process provided\nfor in the Constitution and the law but is not entitled to flout it\nbecause _it believes it to be inconsistent with the law or the\nConstitution. Interpretation of the law is the exclusive domain of\nthe judiciary.\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\nGuided by the above reasoning of a larger Bench of this Court, we similarly\ndispose of the said points with the observation that if any of the parties to\nthe cases in which the said orders were passed, or any other person, was\n\naggrieved by the same, he could have availed of the legal remedy of seeking\n\n4 Contempt proceedings against Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani PLD 2012 SC 553.\n\nCrl.0.P._ No. 1 of 2025. 9\n\na review of the order through the judicial process provided under the\nConstitution and the law. But, no one is entitled to disobey or decline\ncompliance with the court order merely because he believes it to be\n\ninconsistent with the Constitution and the law.\n\n13. Next, we proceed to take up and address the aforementioned\nquestions of law, for which the assistance of the learned amici curiae was\n\nsought.\n\n(i) Whether the Committees constituted under Section 2 of the Act and Article\n191A of the Constitution have the authority to withdraw a case from a Bench\nin which cognisance has already been taken by a reqular Bench and serious\nquestions of constitutional law relating to the jurisdiction of the_reqular\nBench have been framed.\n\n14. The practice of hearing part-heard cases by the same Bench is so\nwell-established in our jurisdiction that neither the learned counsel\nassisting this Court on the above question nor our research assistants\ncould find and cite any case from our jurisdiction in which a dispute arose\nand was adjudicated regarding the withdrawal of a part-heard case from\none Bench and its reassignment to another, without a request being made\nby the original Bench hearing the case in its judicial order. However, such\ndisputes have arisen and been adjudicated upon in the neighbouring\njurisdiction, i.e., the Indian jurisdiction, in several cases. Since the bench\nconstitution and case-assignment legal framework in both our jurisdiction\nand the neighbouring jurisdiction are largely similar, the jurisprudence\ndeveloped there would offer valuable insights for the determination of the\nquestion under consideration before this Court. The relevant portions of\n\nsome of these cases are, therefore, cited below:\n\nZikar v. Govt. of State of M.P. AIR1951 Nag 11 (DB)5\n\nThe point for consideration is whether the power to regulate the\nsittings of the High Court which the Chief Justice undoubtedly\npossesses can be invoked for withdrawing and transferring a case\nof which a Division Court is in seisin. The power to regulate the\nsittings of the Court which is an administrative power cannot afford\nany basis for regulating the mode of hearing of a case by a Court\nproperly seized of it. The power to withdraw and transfer a case from\nsuch a Court without its concurrence is a power to prevent the\nexercise of jurisdiction by that Court which can only be done by\nvirtue_of a superior power of control or correction, for which\nauthority must be found either in an express provision or by\nnecessary implication. There is no express provision and in our view\nthere is no warrant for any such implication.\n\n5 The decision taken in this case was later implicitly affirmed by the Supreme Court, in an appeal arising out of contempt\nproceedings in M.Y. Shareef v. Hon'ble Judges of The High Court of Nagpur AIR 1955 SC 19.\n\nCrl.0.P._ No. 1 of 2025. 10\n\nThe argument of the learned Counsel for the applicant that the\napplication should have been placed before the Honourable the\nActing Chief Justice or that the Acting Chief Justice has the power\nto withdraw or transfer a case before us without our concurrence is\ndevoid of any basis in law and is in fact opposed to precedents.\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\nM. Ranka v. Hon’ble the Chief Justice (1991) 2 L.W. 225 (DB)¢®\n\nWith respect we disagree with the last observation of S.\nRamalingam, J. that a party or a counsel may make a special\nmention before the Chief Justice so that the case pending before\none Bench may be posted before another Bench. So far as other two\nobservations are concerned, we think it right to say that if for some\nreasons, the learned Judges assigned with a case or cases, find that\nthey should not hear the case or the cases, they may direct the\npapers to be placed before the Chief Justice for posting such case\nor cases before some other Bench and in some extraordinary\ncircumstances, the counsel appearing in a case may make a special\nrequest that a particular case or cases may not be heard by a\nparticular Bench for reasons none other than the reasons that are\nspelt out in the principles that no one shall be a judge in his own\ncause (Nemo debet esse judex propria cause). So far as the first rule\nis concerned, if the Judge himself or the Judges themselves say that\na particular case or cases assigned to him/them say be taken out\nof his/their list, there should be no difficulty. So far as the second\nrule is concerned in which it is said that a counsel may bring to the\nnotice of the court that a particular case or cases may not be heard\nby a particular Bench or a Judge of the court means to say only\nthat the counsel would being a fact to the notice of the court and\nno more. He cannot be allowed to insist or ask this Court not to\nhear a case. It will be again for the Judge or the Judges hearing the\ncase to decide whether they should say that the cases be listed\nbefore another Judge or Bench or not. Judges of the court including\nthe Chief Justice are equals and exercise the same judicial power\nexcept such powers that are specifically assigned to the Chief\nJustice. There is no reason to concede a power in the Chief Justice\nto transfer a case from one Bench to another Bench of the Court or\nfrom one Judge to another Judge of the Court. Act of allocating\nbusiness or portfolio or assigning case or cases is different from the\nact of recalling the case from the file of a particular Judge or a\nBench of the court and from transferring a case from the file of a\nparticular Judge or a Bench of the court and from transferring a\ncase from the file of a particular Judge or a Bench of the court, to\nanother Judge or a Bench of the court because any decision about\nit would partake the character of a judicial order.\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\nJawahar Ram Gupta v. Hon’ble Chief Justice 1996 (27) ALR 557\nThe Chief Justice is free to assign a_case_ where he will, but\ntransferring an already assigned case from one Judge to another,\nwe reiterate with emphasis, is not an authority which the Supreme\nCourt observed for itself was with it. After April 13, 1996 when the\nChief Justice had assigned this matter to this Court, the sanctity of\nthe proceedings, as the Supreme Court has held, cannot be\ninterfered with even by the legislature.\n\nActivity outside the courtrooms in Court cases, and such Sunday\nresidence orders of Chief Justices, could have disastrous\n\n6 This opinion of Division Bench was approved by the Full Bench in M. Ranka v. Hon’ble Chief Justice of Tamilnadu\nHigh Court, Madars (1994) 2 L.W. 135.\n\nCrl.0.P._ No. 1 of 2025. 11\n\nconsequences in the High Court's handling of matters, particularly\nthose sensitive matters which many already try to avoid hearing.\n\nThis Court records with great humility, and concern, that what the\nSupreme Court could not do, the Hon'ble the Chief Justice was\nmisled to do and at his residence, not in Court. Whatever be the\ndegree of the in facie curiae contemptuous situation, it will be\njudged by the Division of the High Court concerned. The reservation\nalso will be considered by that Division. Otherwise, what will be\nhappen is that the record will remain within the portals of the court\nof Record in perpetuity as no Division will be able to enter judgment.\nOn this the Supreme Court clearly reflected: “As for transfer from\none Judge to another, there again is no original jurisdiction which\nwe can exercise. It is not a fundamental right and so Article 32 has\nno application and there is no other law to which recourse can be\nhad”.\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\nThe above extracts illustrate a well-established practice that once a case\nis assigned to a Bench and that Bench has taken seisin (assumed\njurisdiction) of the matter and partly heard it, the Chief Justice cannot\nunilaterally withdraw it and reassign it to another Bench except under\nspecific, judicially recognised circumstances. This practice is firmly rooted\nin the high constitutional value of judicial independence whereby a Bench\nenjoys the freedom and independence to adjudicate upon a lis it has taken\ncognisance of. When a Bench is seized of a case and has partly heard it,\nthe matter becomes part of judicial proceedings, and the Bench hearing\nthe case assumes exclusive jurisdiction over it. Any interference—whether\nthrough withdrawal or reassignment—without judicial justification\n\nundermines the principle of judicial independence.\n\n15. The said practice imposes a significant limitation on the\nadministrative powers of the Chief Justice. While the Chief Justice has the\nauthority to regulate the formation of Benches and allocate cases as an\nadministrative function, these powers do not extend to withdrawing or\ntransferring a part-heard case from a Bench that has already assumed\njurisdiction. Such withdrawal or reassignment is not merely an\nadministrative act but a judicial one. Consequently, any such action must\neither stem from a judicial order passed by the Bench seized of the matter\nor be supported by express statutory authority if carried out by another\n\ncourt or authority.\n\n16. The principles of judicial propriety and case continuity require that\na Bench, once seized of a case, must see it through to its conclusion,\nbarring exceptional circumstances. Arbitrary withdrawal or reassignment\n\nof a case after it has been partly heard sets a dangerous precedent,\n\nCrl.0.P._ No. 1 of 2025. 12\n\nundermines the sanctity of judicial proceedings and erodes public\nconfidence in the judiciary. Exceptional circumstances that may justify\nthe reassignment of a case include instances where the Bench seized of\nthe matter makes a judicial request for reassignment due to recusal,\nconflict of interest or other valid reasons. As the decision regarding the\nwithdrawal or reassignment of a case partakes of the character of judicial\nprocess. Such decisions cannot rely solely on administrative discretion, as\nthis would compromise the finality and integrity of judicial orders. These\nprinciples collectively affirm that the sanctity of judicial proceedings takes\nprecedence over administrative powers, thereby safeguarding the\n\nimpartiality and independence of the judiciary.\n\n17. For almost similar reasons that create a bar on the power of\nassignment of cases concerning the withdrawal and reassignment of part-\nheard cases, this Court held in Human Rights Case No. 14959-K of\n2018 (PLD 2019 SC 183) that a similar limitation also applies to the\n\nconstitution of benches. It was held and observed in that case:\n\nThe above Rule [of Order XI of the Supreme Court Rules 18980]\nprovides for administrative powers of the Chief Justice to constitute\nbenches. However, once the bench is constituted, cause list is\nissued and the bench starts hearing the cases, the matter regarding\nconstitution of the bench goes outside the pale of administrative\npowers of the Chief Justice and rest on the judicial side, with the\nbench. Any member of the bench may, however, recuse to hear a\ncase for personal reasons or may not be available to sit on the bench\ndue to prior commitments or due to illness. The bench may also be\nreconstituted if it is against the Rules and requires a three-member\nbench instead of two. In such eventualities the bench passes an\norder to place the matter before the Chief Justice to nominate a new\nbench. Therefore, once a bench has been constituted, cause list\nissued and the bench is assembled for hearing cases, the Chief\nJustice cannot reconstitute the bench, except in the manner\ndiscussed above.\n\n7. In the absence of a recusal by a member of the Bench, any\namount of disagreement amongst the members of the Bench, on an\nissue before them, cannot form a valid ground for reconstitution of\nthe Bench. Any reconstitution of the Bench on this ground would\nimpinge on the constitutional value of independence of judiciary.\nThe construct of judicial system is pillared on the assumption that\nevery judge besides being fair and impartial is fiercely independent\nand is free to uphold his judicial view. This judicial freedom is\nfoundational to the concept of Rule of Law. Reconstitution of a\nbench while hearing a case, in the absence of any recusal from any\nmember on the bench or due to any other reason described above,\nwould amount to stifling the independent view of the judge. Any\neffort to muffle disagreement or to silence dissent or to dampen an\nalternative viewpoint of a member on the bench, would shake the\nfoundations of a free and impartial justice system, thereby eroding\nthe public confidence _on which the entire edifice of judicature\nstands.\n\n\nCrl.0.P._ No. 1 of 2025. 13\n\nPublic confidence is the most precious asset that this branch of\nthe State has. It is also one of the most precious assets of the nation.\n\n(Emphasis added)\nWhile relying on the above observations in the case of Muhammad\nImtiyaz,’ this Court reiterated that the arbitrary reconstitution of Benches\nundermines the integrity of the judicial system and may have serious\nrepercussions. If Benches are changed arbitrarily without justifiable\nreasons, it creates doubts and raises concerns about the fairness of the\nsystem. The public may question the impartiality of a judicial process that\nappears arbitrary. To uphold the rule of law, transparency and fairness in\nthe matters of the constitution of Benches and the assignment of cases is\nimperative to maintain the independence, integrity and prestige of this\n\nCourt.\n\n18. We may mention here that it was argued before us that the cases\nconcerning the powers of the Chief Justice, decided prior to the\npromulgation of the Act, have become irrelevant following the\nestablishment of the Bench Constitution Committee under Section 2 of the\nAct, which has been endorsed by the Full Court of the Supreme Court on\nthe judicial side in the case of Raja Amer.® We, however, are not persuaded\nby this argument for the simple reason that it was categorically held in\nRaja Amer that the powers of the Committee under Section 2 of the Act are\nthe same as those previously exercised by the Chief Justice. The relevant\n\nobservation is as follows:\n\nBoth the powers of suo motu invoking original jurisdiction and\nconstituting benches were earlier being exercised by one person, the\nChief Justice; it is these administrative powers that have now been\nconferred on the Committee comprising three persons, i.e., the\nChief Justice and the two most senior Judges - nothing more\nnothing less.°\n\nTherefore, whatever was stated in the referred cases regarding the powers\nof the Chief Justice to assign or withdraw cases from Benches fully applies\n\nto the Committees as well.\n\n19. In view of the settled jurisprudence of the subcontinent on the\nconstitution of Benches and the assignment of cases discussed above, we\n\nanswer question (i) in the negative. We hold that the Committees\n\nconstituted under Sections 2 of the Act and 191A of the Constitution lack\n\n7 Muhammad Imtiyaz v. Muhammad Naeem PLD 2023 SC 306.\n8 Raja Amer v. Federation of Pakistan PLJ 2024 SC 114 (2024 SCP 91).\n° Ibid, per Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, J., para 30 (Majority Judgment).\n\nCrl.0.P._ No. 1 of 2025. 14\n\nthe authority to withdraw a case that has been partly heard, where\ncognisance has already been taken by a regular Bench, and transfer it to\nanother Bench, unless the Bench itself refers the case to the Committees\nfor its assignment to another Bench for some justifiable reason. Such\npartly heard cases may include those where serious questions of\nconstitutional law concerning the jurisdiction of the regular Bench have\nbeen framed, some arguments on those questions have been heard and\n\nthe hearing has been adjourned for further arguments.\n\n(ii) Whether the said Committees can, by an administrative order, undo the\neffect of a judicial order, whereby next date of hearing a specific case has\nbeen fixed before a reqular Bench to hear arguments on the jurisdiction of\n\nthe regular Bench.\n\n20. This question need not detain us long, as a similar issue was\naddressed and decided by a Full Court of this Court in the case of Malik\nAsad Ali.!° It was held in the said case that an administrative order passed\nby the Hon’ble Chief Justice (acting under restraint) passed in derogation\nof a judicial order would be without lawful authority and of no legal effect.\nIn that case, the Chief Justice's administrative declaration, which sought\nto invalidate the convening of a Full Court under a judicial order of a Bench\nfor hearing cases listed in Supplementary Cause List No. 405 of 1997, was\ndeclared illegal.\n\n21. The above cited observations of a seven-member Bench of this Court\nin the contempt case against Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani are equally relevant.\nIt was observed therein that “the executive authority may question a\nCourt’s decision through the judicial process provided for in the\nConstitution and the law but is not entitled to flout it because it believes\nit to be inconsistent with the law or the Constitution.” This principle\napplies with equal force to the executive authority of the Chief Justice or\n\nthe Committees, as the case may be.\n\n22. Therefore, it can be held unequivocally that no administrative\nauthority, including the Committees constituted under Section 2 of the Act\nand 191A of the Constitution, can, by an administrative order, undo the\n\neffect of a judicial order. Question (ii) is answered accordingly.\n\n23. We may mention here that it was also argued before us that the\n\nCommittees did not pass any administrative orders to undo the effect of\n\n10 Malik Asad Ali v. Federation of Pakistan 1998 SCMR 130 and PLD 1998 S.C. 161.\n\nCrl.0.P._ No. 1 of 2025. 15\n\nthe judicial orders. Instead, it was contended, the cases were transferred\nto the Constitutional Bench through the operation of law under Clause (4)\nof Article 191A, which states that all petitions, appeals or review\napplications against judgments rendered or orders passed, to which\nClause (3) applies, pending or filed in the Supreme Court prior to the\ncommencement of the Constitution (Twenty-sixth Amendment) Act 2024,\nstand transferred to the Constitutional Bench. However, we find this\nargument misconceived, and it is sufficiently answered by the formulation\nprovided by Khawaja Haris Ahmad, the learned amicus curiae. For ease of\n\nreference, his formulation is again reproduced here:\n\nIt is noteworthy that when, on 13.01.2025, the learned Bench took\nup the matter relating to its jurisdiction to entertain and decide the\nCPLAs (filed under Article 185(3) of the Constitution) fixed before it,\nthis involved neither assuming jurisdiction over the merits of the\nCPLAs, nor decision of constitutionality of any law point involved in\nthe CPLAs. Rather, in effect, it only took upon itself the task of\nascertaining if Article 191A(3) could be so construed as to exclude\nthe Bench’s jurisdiction to hear the CPLAs. To do so, the learned\nBench was dealing with the matter like any other case where\nquestion of jurisdiction is raised - i.e. (i) first looking at the wording\nof the provision itself to see if it per se excluded the Court’s\njurisdiction; and, (ii) if so, to see whether the provision of law relied\nupon for excluding the Court’s jurisdiction constitutes valid law or\nnot. Thus, in the instant case, the learned Bench would first\nexamine the words of Article 191A(3) to ascertain if a plain reading\nof it excludes the Court’s jurisdiction in the matter; and, if such\nexclusion is a necessary consequence, then the Court would\nproceed to ascertain the constitutional validity of Article 191A(3).\nPrima facie it appears that the aforesaid exercise in not covered by\nexclusionary provisions of Article 191A(3) of the Constitution.\n\nAs evident from the above, the three-member Bench that passed the order\ndated 13 January 2025 was not deliberating on the constitutionality of the\nlaw challenged in those cases but was addressing the jurisdictional\nquestion, which every court inherently has the power to adjudicate. The\nBench, which had previously referred such cases to the Constitutional\nBench, was confronted with the principles governing a court’s inherent\npower to decide jurisdictional questions. When the argument was prima\nfacie supported by the referred precedents of the cases of Pir Sabir\nShah, Fazlul Quader Chowdhry and Marbury, the Bench decided to\nadjudicate the jurisdictional matter after obtaining full assistance from the\nlearned counsel for the parties, and the cases were adjourned to allow for\n\nfurther preparation and assistance on the jurisdictional issue.\n\n24. In Pir Sabir Shah, the Court addressed the jurisdictional question of\nwhether appeals filed before it under Section 8-B of the Political Parties\n\nCrl.0.P._ No. 1 of 2025. 16\n\nAct, 1962, were competent and whether that provision was ultra vires the\nConstitution. Similarly, in Fazlul Quader Chowdhry, the Court dealt with\nthe question of whether Clause (4) of Article 224 of the 1962 Constitution,\nwhich barred all courts from questioning the validity of constitutional\namendments, was ultra vires the Constitution. The principle emerging\nfrom these cases is that if a dispute arises concerning a court’s jurisdiction\nover a particular matter, the court has the power to hear and determine\nthat dispute—even if its conclusion leads to the finding that it lacks\njurisdiction. Moreover, in determining its jurisdiction, the court may\nexamine the constitutionality of the law, including any constitutional\nprovision, that confers or bars its jurisdiction. Based on this principle, the\nBench that passed the order dated 13 January 2025 was acting within its\njurisdiction. If, ultimately, it had determined that Article 191A validly\nexcluded its jurisdiction, it would have transferred the cases to the\nConstitutional Bench in accordance with Clause (5) of Article 191A of the\nConstitution, and would not have proceeded to address the matter of the\n\nconstitutionality of the law challenged in those cases.\n\n25. For these reasons, we find that it was the administrative decisions\nof the Committees that illegally nullified the judicial orders and unlawfully\ndeprived the regular Bench of its judicial power to decide the jurisdictional\nquestion raised before it. Such jurisdictional questions, as contended by\nKhawaja Haris Ahmad, do not fall within the ambit of Clauses (3) and (5)\nof Article 191A of the Constitution.\n\n26. As both the above questions have been answered in the negative. We\nare sanguine that the office shall fix the main case i.e. CPLA No. 836-K of\n2020, etc before the original three-member bench comprising Syed\nMansoor Ali Shah, Ayesha A. Malik, and Irfan Saadat Khan, JJ. in the first\nweek of February 2025.\n\nDecision on the Explanation of the Alleged Contemner\n\n27. Having answered the questions of law, we now turn to the validity of\nthe explanation furnished by the alleged contemner in response to the\nshow-cause notice. Under Section 17(3) of the Contempt of Court\nOrdinance 2003, we must determine whether the interests of justice\nrequire further action and whether a charge for contempt of court should\nbe framed against him. As required by law, the alleged contemner was\n\ngiven an opportunity for a preliminary hearing, and we have duly\n\nCrl.0.P._ No. 1 of 2025. 17\n\nconsidered his written reply, along with the documents filed in support\n\nthereof.\n\n28. It has become evident from the record that in compliance with the\ncourt order dated 16 January 2025, the alleged contemner initiated a note\non the same day—16 January 2025—regarding the constitution of a\nSpecial Bench comprising the Judges mentioned in the said order.\nHowever, the Committee constituted under Section 2 of the Act, by a\nmajority comprising the Hon’ble Chief Justice and Hon’ble Justice Amin-\nud-Din Khan, passed an order on 17 January 2025, withdrawing the cases\nfrom the regular Bench and directing that they be placed before the\nCommittee constituted under Article 191A of the Constitution for fixation\n\nbefore the Constitutional Bench.\n\n29. We find that the alleged contemner did what he could to comply with\nthe court order. As stated in his written reply, he had no authority to\nconstitute the Bench of Judges as mentioned in the court order. At most,\nhe could inform the Competent Authority, which was done by him not only\nin a timely manner but also with a proposal for the constitution of the\nSpecial Bench comprising the Judges specified in the court order, for the\nfixation of cases before it as directed. The alleged contemner’s failure to fix\nthe case before the Bench specified in the court order, therefore, does not\n\nconstitute a contumacious act on his part.\n\n30. Inacontempt appeal by the Registrar of the High Court of Sindh,!!\na fourteen-member larger Bench of this Court drew a distinction between\na case of contempt against a party to the case and a case of contempt\n\nagainst an officer of the Court, in the following words:\n\nA distinction has to be made between a case of contempt of Court\nbased on defiance or violation of a judicial order in the nature of\ntemporary injunction by a party whereby such party was restrained\nfrom acting in a particular manner but in spite of service of notice\nor having come to know of the passing of such order, acts in a\nmanner to alter the position to his advantage so as to frustrate the\ntemporary injunction and an act of mere non-submission of a report\ncalled for by the Court by an Officer of the Court. In the former case,\nthe Court would take strict view and mere act of defiance of the\njudicial order would by itself justify raising of presumption that the\ndoer of the act was guilty of contempt of Court unless he proves\notherwise whereas in the latter case, it has to be determined on\napplication of judicial mind as to whether the accused deliberately\ndid not submit the report on account of having personal interest in\nany of the parties to cause damage to the other party in the case in\n\n'! In re: Muhammad Sadiq Leghari, Registrar High Court of Sindh PLD 2002 SC 1033.\n\nCrl.0.P._ No. 1 of 2025. 18\n\nwhich the report was called or had any personal interest which, if\nproved or established, would make the act of non-submission of the\nreport mala fide. In the absence of any of these factors and element\nof contumacy, his conduct could not be held to have suffered from\nmala fides or contempt of Court. Mere non-compliance of an order,\nin the absence of contumacy, would not amount to contempt of\nCourt.\n\nPer Rana Bhagwandas, J. (Additional note)\n\nIt may be pertinent to observe further that every failure to comply\nwith an order may not amount to be criminal contempt warranting\naction therefor. There may be cases where there are justifiable\nreasons or causes for non adherence of an order of a Court which\nwould depend on the facts of each case. There may also be cases\nwhere non-compliance of the order was not wilful or deliberate.\nLikewise, there may be instances where compliance with an order\nof a Court may be beyond the scope of authority of a person to whom\nit is directed. Each-case, therefore, has to be examined in its proper\nperspective having regard to the facts and circumstances of a case.\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\nUpon examining the case of the present alleged contemner, the Additional\nRegistrar (Judicial) of this Court, we find that he did not deliberately avoid\nthe fixation of the cases before the Bench as directed in the court order.\nThere is no evidence to suggest that he had any personal interest in the\nmatter or had connived with any of the parties to the case, nor did he act\nwith the intention of causing damage to any of the parties to the case.\nThere is no indication of mala fide intent in his actions. In the absence of\nany such factors or elements of contumacy, his conduct cannot be\nconsidered contumacious, nor can it be said to have suffered from mala\n\nfides, requiring contempt proceedings against him. For these reasons, by\n\naccepting his explanation, the show-cause notice issued against him for\n\ncontempt proceeding is discharged.\n\nContempt Proceedings Against the Members of the Committees\n\n31. We have also deliberated on the question of whether, following the\ndischarge of the show-cause notice against the alleged contemner, the\nAdditional Registrar (Judicial), the matter should be considered concluded\nor whether it should proceed further against the members of the two\nCommittees, where the first Committee unlawfully withdrew the part-\nheard cases from a Bench and transferred it for the consideration of the\nother Committee, through an administrative order by undoing the effect of\na judicial order. While the second Committee, in total disregard of the\njudicial order passed by the regular Bench, simply in pursuance of the\ndirection of the first Committee, went ahead and fixed the case before the\n\nConstitutional Bench on 27 January 2025. Both the Committees were not\n\nCrl.0.P._ No. 1 of 2025. 19\n\nlegally authorized to take administrative decisions dated 17 January 2025\nin violation of the judicial order. In this background, it appears that the\nmatter has to proceed further against the members of the two Committees.\nHowever, judicial propriety and decorum demand that the said question\nbe considered and decided by the Full Court of the Supreme Court so that\nit is authoritatively decided once and for all. We note with advantage that\nthe matter of contempt proceedings against the Registrar of a High Court!\nwas treated with such gravity that a larger bench of 14 Judges was\nconvened to adjudicate it. Therefore, in our view, this issue is even more\nserious, warranting the collective and institutional deliberation of all\nJudges of this Court. Consequently, we refer this matter to the Hon’ble\nChief Justice for the convening of the Full Court to deliberate and decide\n\non this important issue.\n\n32. We may clarify here that we have not referred this matter to the\nCommittee constituted under Section 2 of the Act, as its authority is\nlimited to constituting benches of the Supreme Court. The Full Court of\nthe Supreme Court, however, is constituted by the Constitution itself\nunder Article 176. The distinction between the benches of a Court and the\nFull Court is well-established and constitutionally recognised in the\nprovisions of Article 203J(2)(c) and (d) of the Constitution and the\nresponsibility of convening the Full Court conventionally falls within the\n\ndomain of the Chief Justice.\n\n33. Before parting with this judgment, we find it necessary to\nacknowledge and express our appreciation for the invaluable assistance\n\nrendered to us by all the learned amici curiae, especially on such short\n\nnotice.\nJudge\nAnnounced.\nIslamabad, Judge\n\n27 January 2025.\n\nJudge\nApproved for reporting\nIqbal\n\n'2 In re: Muhammad Sadiq Leghari, Registrar High Court of Sindh PLD 2002 SC 1033.\n\nCrl.0.P._ No. 1 of 2025.\n\n20",
            "CleanedText": "ORDER The underlying facts that have given rise to an unsavoury situation are that a three-member Bench of this Court comprising Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Ayesha A. Malik, and Irfan Saadat Khan, JJ. heard certain cases CPLA No. 836-K of 2020, etc. on 13 January 2025. At the outset of the proceedings, an objection was raised regarding the Bench s jurisdiction to hear these cases, which involved a challenge to the constitutionality of a law, on the basis of Article 191A of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan Constitution . After hearing arguments of the learned counsel on the jurisdictional objection, the Bench adjourned the hearing to 16 January 2025 by allowing time to the learned counsel for the parties to make preparation to further assist the Court on the points concerning the jurisdictional objection. The order dated 13 January 2025 is reproduced below: At the very outset, the learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the present regular bench of the Court cannot hear these cases, as they involve a challenge to the constitutionality of a law, namely, subsection 2 of Section 221-A of the Customs Act, 1969. When asked why this bench cannot hear these cases, the learned counsel referred to the provisions of Article 191A, which was added to the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan through the 26th Constitutional Amendment. In response to the petitioners objection regarding the lack of jurisdiction of the present bench of the Court, the learned counsel for the respondents contended that Article Crl.0.P. No. 1 of 2025. 2 191A, the basis of the objection regarding jurisdiction, is constitutionally invalid as it infringes upon the salient features of the Constitution, including the independence of the judiciary and the separation of powers among the three organs of the State. He further submitted that a constitutionally invalid amendment cannot oust the constitutionally valid conferment of jurisdiction on the regular benches of the Court. 2. When asked how the present bench of the Court can decide upon the constitutional validity of the newly added Article 191A, the learned counsel for the respondents took the position that since the objection raised and the basis thereof pertain to the jurisdiction of the present bench, it must be decided by it. In support of his stance, he referred to Sabir Shah v. Shad Muhammad Khan PLD 1995 SC 66 , Fazlul Quader Chowdhry v. Abdul Haque PLD 1963 SC 486 and Marbury v. Madison 5 US 137 1803 and sought time to further assist the Court on this point. 3. Given the objection raised and the reply thereto, we find that it would be necessary to first decide upon the same before proceeding further in the matter at hand. Therefore, the learned counsel for the parties are granted time to prepare their arguments and assist the Court on the said points. The hearing for arguments on those points is adjourned to 16.01.2025. On 16 January 2025, the three-member Bench stood reconstituted, with Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi, J., replacing Irfan Saadat Khan, J., and the said cases were posted before the reconstituted Bench. However, the reconstituted Bench could not proceed with the hearing, as Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi, J., was one of the two judges who had delivered the impugned judgment in these cases in the High Court of Sindh. Consequently, the reconstituted Bench comprising Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Ayesha A. Malik and Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi, JJ. directed the office, by its order dated 16 January 2025, to fix these cases before the earlier Bench on Monday, 20 January 2025, at 1:00 pm. The order dated 16 January 2025 is reproduced below for ready reference: These cases were heard on 13.01.2025 by a bench comprising Mr. Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Mrs. Justice Ayesha A. Malik and Mr. Justice Irfan Saadat Khan and were posted for 16.01.2025, however, the bench today cannot hear this matter, as the impugned judgment has been authored by one of us Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi, J. . Considering that it was a part heard matter, let these cases be posted for 20.01.2025 at 01:00 p.m. before the same bench comprising Mr. Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Mrs. Justice Ayesha A. Malik and Mr. Justice Irfan Saadat Khan. Notice shall also be issued to the Attorney General for Pakistan under Order XXVII-A of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 CPC . On 20 January 2025, Mr. Salahuddin, ASC counsel for one of the respondents in the said cases , appeared before the Bench comprising Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Ayesha A. Malik, and Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi, JJ. that had passed the aforementioned order and pointed out that the cases Crl.0.P. No. 1 of 2025. 3 had not been fixed for hearing as per the court order dated 16 January 2025. The Bench called for the Additional Registrar Judicial ; however, due to his unavailability, the Deputy Registrar Judicial appeared. The Deputy Registrar confirmed that the cases had not been fixed on that day, i.e., 20 January 2025 before any regular Bench but had instead been fixed for hearing before the Constitutional Bench on 27 January 2025, pursuant to the decision of the Committee constituted under the Supreme Court Practice and Procedure Act, 2023 Act . He further submitted that the decision of the Committee had not yet been communicated to the office, in writing. Upon receiving information of these facts, the said Bench initiated suo motu contempt proceedings against the Additional Registrar Judicial for defiance of the court order and for obstructing the administration of justice. The Bench, while calling for his explanation, fixed the hearing of the contempt proceedings for 21 January 2025 by its order dated 20 January 2025. Relevant paragraphs 4 and 5 of the order dated 20 January 2025 are reproduced below: 4. It is a sad state of affairs that a judicial order of this Court has been ignored by the office and the cases put up before the Committee for a decision, despite the precedents of this Court to the contrary reported as Asad Ali v. Federation of Pakistan 1998 SCMR 15 , Asad Ali v. Federation of Pakistan 1998 SCMR 130 and Human Rights Case No.14959-K of 2018 PLD 2019 SC 183 . The defiance of the judicial order of this Court lowers the dignity and honour of this Court and hamper the administration of justice. In this background, let notice be issued to the Additional Registrar Judicial of this Court as to why contempt proceedings may not be initiated against him. 5. Office shall number this petition and fix it for hearing before us tomorrow i.e., 21.01.2025, when the additional Registrar Judicial shall appear in person with the explanation as to why the above-mentioned cases have not been fixed before the Bench today. On 21 January 2025, the Bench that had passed the aforementioned order was reconstituted, excluding Ayesha A. Malik, J., from the Bench, and the suo motu contempt proceeding was listed before this reconstituted twomember Bench comprising Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi, JJ. . 2. On 21 January 2025, in response to the notice issued to the Additional Registrar Judicial of this Court, the Registrar of the Court appeared on behalf of the Additional Registrar Judicial , who was reported to be indisposed. The Registrar presented copies of two decisions made by two different Committees: first, the decision of the Committee constituted under Section 2 of the Act; and second, the decision of the Committee Crl.0.P. No. 1 of 2025. 4 constituted under Article 191A of the Constitution. He stated that the Committee constituted under Section 2 of the Act convened its meeting on 17 January 2025 and, by a majority decision, resolved to withdraw the said cases from the regular Bench and refer them to the Committee established under Article 191A of the Constitution. Subsequently, the latter Committee convened its meeting on the same date, i.e., 17 January 2025, and directed that all cases challenging the vires of the 26th Constitutional Amendment and vires of law be fixed for hearing before the Constitutional Bench on 27 January 2025. He explained that, because of these decisions by the two Committees, the said cases were not fixed by the office for hearing on 20 January 2025 before the regular Bench. The explanation provided by the Registrar, coupled with the contention raised by Mr. Salahuddin, ASC counsel for one of the respondents in the said cases , gave rise to the following substantial questions of law of public importance: i Whether the Committees constituted under Section 2 of the Act and Article 191A of the Constitution have the authority to withdraw a case from a Bench , in which cognisance has already been taken by a regular Bench and serious questions of constitutional law relating to the jurisdiction of the regular Bench have been framed; and ii Whether the said Committees can, by an administrative order, undo the effect of a judicial order, whereby next date of hearing a specific case has been fixed before a regular Bench to hear arguments on the jurisdiction of the regular Bench . The Court observed that uJnder Article 190 of the Constitution, all executive and judicial authorities throughout Pakistan, including officers within the establishment of this Court, are required to act in aid of the Supreme Court, meaning in aid of its judicial orders, not administrative orders. Furthermore, in accordance with the constitutional mandate of Article 5 of the Constitution, every citizen, including officers within the establishment of this Court, is bound to obey the Constitution and the law. Accordingly, the legality of the explanation put forth by the Registrar, as well as the outcome of the present contempt proceedings, hinges upon the determination of the aforementioned questions. 3. In light of the significance of the questions involved, the Court appointed Mr. Hamid Khan, Sr. ASC, and Mr. Muneer A. Malik, Sr. ASC, as amici curiae to assist in addressing the aforementioned questions. Additionally, the Court granted permission to Mr. Shahid Jamil Khan, ASC counsel for one of the respondents in the main cases , to assist in the Crl.0.P. No. 1 of 2025. 5 matter. Notice was also issued to the learned Attorney-General for Pakistan to provide assistance on the above questions. The hearing was then adjourned to 22 January 2025 for arguments on these questions. 4. On 22 January 2025, the Court heard the arguments of Mr. Shahid Jamil Khan, ASC counsel for one of the respondents in the main cases , as well as those of the learned amici curiae, Mr. Muneer A. Malik, Sr. ASC, and Mr. Hamid Khan, Sr. ASC. The Court also appointed two additional amici curiae, Mr. Ahsan Bhoon, ASC, and Khawaja Haris Ahmad, ASC, to assist in addressing the said questions, and adjourned the hearing to 23 January 2025. 5. On 23 January 2025, the Court heard further arguments of Mr. Hamid Khan, Sr. ASC, the learned amicus curiae, as well as from Mr. Salahuddin, ASC counsel for one of the respondents in the main cases . The Court also heard the arguments of Mr. Ahsan Bhoon, ASC, and Khawaja Haris Ahmad, ASC, the learned amici curiae, as well as the learned Attorney-General for Pakistan. 6. On the same day, i.e., 23 January 2025, the respondent-accused, Mr. Nazar Abbas, the Additional Registrar Judicial , filed his written reply Crl.M.A. No. 134/2025 to the show cause notice. He explained his position mostly in the same terms as the explanation provided by the Registrar of the Court, on his behalf on 21 January 2025, as noted above. Some relevant portions of his reply are reproduced below: 1. That the answering respondent in reply to the subject Notice begs to submit that the undersigned has held this Hon ble Court in the highest respect and esteem throughout his 36 long years of service with unblemished service record. Accordingly, the undersigned cannot even imagine wilful flouting or disregarding any order passed by this Hon ble Court especially on the last leg of his service career which is going to end in a couple of weeks. 7. That as per the Court Roster, the requisite Bench for the purpose of hearing CPLA No.836-K/2020 etc. was not available on 20.01.2025, therefore, a note was initiated for constitution of Special Bench comprising Hon ble Judges as mentioned in the order dated 16.01.2025, which partly heard the matter on 13.01.2025. 8. That upon perusal of the office note, the HCJ was pleased to place the matter before the Committee constituted under Section 2 1 of the Supreme Court Practice and Procedure Act, 2023 in the following terms: May be placed before the Committee tomorrow at 12 noon. 9. That on 17.01.2025, the Committee constituted under Section 2 1 of the Supreme Court Practice and Procedure Act, Crl.0.P. No. 1 of 2025. 6 2023 decided through majority vote that the matter be placed before the Committee constituted under Article 191A 4 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973. 10. That the Committee constituted under Article 191A 4 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973 held its meeting at 12:45 pm on 17.01.2025 and resolved that all cases challenging the 26th Constitution amendment and vires of Law be fixed before the 8 members Constitutional Bench on 27.01.2025, the Court Roster be issued accordingly. 12. That the constitution of Benches or approval of the Roster is beyond the capacity as well as jurisdiction of the answering respondent. The responsibility of the answering respondent at the most is to apprise the Competent Authority to the non-availability of any appropriate bench, which has been not only conveyed before time but also has been suggested to be met with by formation of special Bench so there is no lapse on the part of the answering respondent in the whole scenario. 13. That act of the office regarding non-fixation of the case before the Bench, was neither deliberate not wilful, it was in pursuance of the decisions taken by the two Committees. The answering respondent initiated an office note to comply with the order of the Court dated 16.01.2025 in letter and spirit by the constitution of the requisite Special bench and having no intention to withhold or disobey the order of the Hon ble Court. PRAYER Inspite of the above facts, the answering respondent surrenders himself at the mercy of this Hon ble Court with further prayer that the Show Cause Notice dated 20.01.2025 may kindly be withdrawn in the interest of justice. 7. We have considered the explanation provided by the respondentaccused in his reply to the show cause notice, as well as the arguments of the learned amici curiae, the learned Attorney-General and the learned counsel for some of the respondents in the main cases. Preliminary points regarding the jurisdiction of the Benches that passed the orders dated 13 and 16 January 2025 8. First, we find it appropriate to address two preliminary points raised before us regarding the jurisdiction of the Benches that passed the orders dated 13 and 16 January 2025. 9. The first point raised was that the three-member Bench, which passed the order dated 13 January 2025, lacked jurisdiction to hear cases involving a challenge to the constitutionality of a law, as such matters fall within the exclusive domain of the Constitutional Bench under Article 191A of the Constitution. It was also argued that the said Bench could not examine the vires of the 26th Constitutional Amendment, whereby Article 191A was added to the Constitution, as this too falls within the exclusive domain of the Constitutional Bench under Article 191A. Crl.0.P. No. 1 of 2025. 7 10. The said point was also rebutted before us with the submissions that the Bench which passed the order dated 13 January 2025 had not commenced hearing the matter concerning the constitutionality of the law. Instead, it was hearing arguments on the objection raised to its jurisdiction to entertain such matters based on Article 191A. Furthermore, the Bench was also deliberating on whether it could examine the constitutionality of Article 191A itself, as the objection to its jurisdiction was rooted in that very Article. Thus, the Bench was addressing the jurisdictional question rather than the substantive matter of the constitutionality of the law involved in the cases before it. Since Khawaja Haris Ahmad, the learned amicus curia, has provided his written articulation on this point, we find it expedient to reproduce the relevant portion here: It is noteworthy that when, on 13.01.2025, the learned Bench took up the matter relating to its jurisdiction to entertain and decide the CPLAs filed under Article 185 3 of the Constitution fixed before it, this involved neither assuming jurisdiction over the merits of the CPLAs, nor decision of constitutionality of any law point involved in the CPLAs. Rather, in effect, it only took upon itself the task of ascertaining if Article 191A 3 could be so construed as to exclude the Bench s jurisdiction to hear the CPLAs. To do so, the learned Bench was dealing with the matter like any other case where question of jurisdiction is raised - i.e. i first looking at the wording of the provision itself to see if it per se excluded the Court s jurisdiction; and, ii if so, to see whether the provision of law relied upon for excluding the Court s jurisdiction constitutes valid law or not. Thus, in the instant case, the learned Bench would first examine the words of Article 191A 3 to ascertain if a plain reading of it excludes the Court s jurisdiction in the matter; and, if such exclusion is a necessary consequence, then the Court would proceed to ascertain the constitutional validity of Article 191A 3 . Prima facie it appears that the aforesaid exercise in not covered by exclusionary provisions of Article 191A 3 of the Constitution. Similarly, Mr. Shahid Jamil Khan, ASC, adopted the same stance. In addition to the cases of Pir Sabir Shah,! Fazlul Quader Chowdhry? and Marbury? referred to by Barrister Salahuddin, he also cited extracts from Justice Fazal Karim s Judicial Review of Public Actions 2nd Edition, Volume 3, pages 1403-1406 , where the learned author has discussed several cases from American, English and Pakistani jurisdictions on this point. 11. The second point raised was that the three-member Bench, which passed the order dated 16 January 2025 directing the office to fix certain Pir Sabir Shah v. Shad Muhammad Khan PLD 1995 SC 66. ? Fazlul Quader Chowdhry v. Abdul Haque PLD 1963 SC 486. 3 Marbury v. Madison 5 US 137 1803 . Crl.0.P. No. 1 of 2025. 8 cases before a particular Bench, acted without lawful authority, and that the said order was passed in contravention of the law governing the constitution of Benches and the assignment of cases. It was contended that the constitution of Benches falls within the domain of the Committee established under Section 2 of the Act, whereas the assignment of cases to Benches is the exclusive authority of the Chief Justice of Pakistan under the Supreme Court Rules, 1980. This point was also contested before us by referring to several precedents where Benches have issued directions for fixing cases even before the Full Court. 12. Weare afraid we cannot address or adjudicate upon the above points in the present contempt proceedings, as the said points raised before us are misplaced. This Bench is not seized with a review petition against the orders of the three-member Benches dated 15 and 16 January 2025. Instead, we are only dealing with the contempt proceedings initiated for the alleged non-compliance with that order. A similar point was raised before this Court during the contempt proceedings against Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani, the then Prime Minister of Pakistan, regarding noncompliance with the directions issued in a judgment. In that case, a seven-member Bench of this Court rejected the same in the following terms: The Respondent s stand amounts to saying that the order of this Court is non-implementable, as he believes that the same is not in accord with the Constitution of Pakistan and the International law. This argument, if accepted, would set a dangerous precedent and anyone would then successfully flout the orders of the Courts by pleading that according to his interpretation they are not in accord with the law. A judgment debtor would then be allowed to plead before the executing Court that the decree against him was inconsistent with the established law. No finality would then be attached to the judgments and orders of the Courts, even those by the apex Court of the Country. ... The executive authority may question a Court s decision through the judicial process provided for in the Constitution and the law but is not entitled to flout it because it believes it to be inconsistent with the law or the Constitution. Interpretation of the law is the exclusive domain of the judiciary. Emphasis added Guided by the above reasoning of a larger Bench of this Court, we similarly dispose of the said points with the observation that if any of the parties to the cases in which the said orders were passed, or any other person, was aggrieved by the same, he could have availed of the legal remedy of seeking 4 Contempt proceedings against Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani PLD 2012 SC 553. Crl.0.P. No. 1 of 2025. 9 a review of the order through the judicial process provided under the Constitution and the law. But, no one is entitled to disobey or decline compliance with the court order merely because he believes it to be inconsistent with the Constitution and the law. 13. Next, we proceed to take up and address the aforementioned questions of law, for which the assistance of the learned amici curiae was sought. i Whether the Committees constituted under Section 2 of the Act and Article 191A of the Constitution have the authority to withdraw a case from a Bench in which cognisance has already been taken by a reqular Bench and serious questions of constitutional law relating to the jurisdiction of the reqular Bench have been framed. 14. The practice of hearing part-heard cases by the same Bench is so well-established in our jurisdiction that neither the learned counsel assisting this Court on the above question nor our research assistants could find and cite any case from our jurisdiction in which a dispute arose and was adjudicated regarding the withdrawal of a part-heard case from one Bench and its reassignment to another, without a request being made by the original Bench hearing the case in its judicial order. However, such disputes have arisen and been adjudicated upon in the neighbouring jurisdiction, i.e., the Indian jurisdiction, in several cases. Since the bench constitution and case-assignment legal framework in both our jurisdiction and the neighbouring jurisdiction are largely similar, the jurisprudence developed there would offer valuable insights for the determination of the question under consideration before this Court. The relevant portions of some of these cases are, therefore, cited below: Zikar v. Govt. of State of M.P. AIR1951 Nag 11 DB 5 The point for consideration is whether the power to regulate the sittings of the High Court which the Chief Justice undoubtedly possesses can be invoked for withdrawing and transferring a case of which a Division Court is in seisin. The power to regulate the sittings of the Court which is an administrative power cannot afford any basis for regulating the mode of hearing of a case by a Court properly seized of it. The power to withdraw and transfer a case from such a Court without its concurrence is a power to prevent the exercise of jurisdiction by that Court which can only be done by virtue of a superior power of control or correction, for which authority must be found either in an express provision or by necessary implication. There is no express provision and in our view there is no warrant for any such implication. 5 The decision taken in this case was later implicitly affirmed by the Supreme Court, in an appeal arising out of contempt proceedings in M.Y. Shareef v. Hon ble Judges of The High Court of Nagpur AIR 1955 SC 19. Crl.0.P. No. 1 of 2025. 10 The argument of the learned Counsel for the applicant that the application should have been placed before the Honourable the Acting Chief Justice or that the Acting Chief Justice has the power to withdraw or transfer a case before us without our concurrence is devoid of any basis in law and is in fact opposed to precedents. Emphasis added M. Ranka v. Hon ble the Chief Justice 1991 2 L.W. 225 DB With respect we disagree with the last observation of S. Ramalingam, J. that a party or a counsel may make a special mention before the Chief Justice so that the case pending before one Bench may be posted before another Bench. So far as other two observations are concerned, we think it right to say that if for some reasons, the learned Judges assigned with a case or cases, find that they should not hear the case or the cases, they may direct the papers to be placed before the Chief Justice for posting such case or cases before some other Bench and in some extraordinary circumstances, the counsel appearing in a case may make a special request that a particular case or cases may not be heard by a particular Bench for reasons none other than the reasons that are spelt out in the principles that no one shall be a judge in his own cause Nemo debet esse judex propria cause . So far as the first rule is concerned, if the Judge himself or the Judges themselves say that a particular case or cases assigned to him/them say be taken out of his/their list, there should be no difficulty. So far as the second rule is concerned in which it is said that a counsel may bring to the notice of the court that a particular case or cases may not be heard by a particular Bench or a Judge of the court means to say only that the counsel would being a fact to the notice of the court and no more. He cannot be allowed to insist or ask this Court not to hear a case. It will be again for the Judge or the Judges hearing the case to decide whether they should say that the cases be listed before another Judge or Bench or not. Judges of the court including the Chief Justice are equals and exercise the same judicial power except such powers that are specifically assigned to the Chief Justice. There is no reason to concede a power in the Chief Justice to transfer a case from one Bench to another Bench of the Court or from one Judge to another Judge of the Court. Act of allocating business or portfolio or assigning case or cases is different from the act of recalling the case from the file of a particular Judge or a Bench of the court and from transferring a case from the file of a particular Judge or a Bench of the court and from transferring a case from the file of a particular Judge or a Bench of the court, to another Judge or a Bench of the court because any decision about it would partake the character of a judicial order. Emphasis added Jawahar Ram Gupta v. Hon ble Chief Justice 1996 27 ALR 557 The Chief Justice is free to assign a case where he will, but transferring an already assigned case from one Judge to another, we reiterate with emphasis, is not an authority which the Supreme Court observed for itself was with it. After April 13, 1996 when the Chief Justice had assigned this matter to this Court, the sanctity of the proceedings, as the Supreme Court has held, cannot be interfered with even by the legislature. Activity outside the courtrooms in Court cases, and such Sunday residence orders of Chief Justices, could have disastrous 6 This opinion of Division Bench was approved by the Full Bench in M. Ranka v. Hon ble Chief Justice of Tamilnadu High Court, Madars 1994 2 L.W. 135. Crl.0.P. No. 1 of 2025. 11 consequences in the High Court s handling of matters, particularly those sensitive matters which many already try to avoid hearing. This Court records with great humility, and concern, that what the Supreme Court could not do, the Hon ble the Chief Justice was misled to do and at his residence, not in Court. Whatever be the degree of the in facie curiae contemptuous situation, it will be judged by the Division of the High Court concerned. The reservation also will be considered by that Division. Otherwise, what will be happen is that the record will remain within the portals of the court of Record in perpetuity as no Division will be able to enter judgment. On this the Supreme Court clearly reflected: As for transfer from one Judge to another, there again is no original jurisdiction which we can exercise. It is not a fundamental right and so Article 32 has no application and there is no other law to which recourse can be had . Emphasis added The above extracts illustrate a well-established practice that once a case is assigned to a Bench and that Bench has taken seisin assumed jurisdiction of the matter and partly heard it, the Chief Justice cannot unilaterally withdraw it and reassign it to another Bench except under specific, judicially recognised circumstances. This practice is firmly rooted in the high constitutional value of judicial independence whereby a Bench enjoys the freedom and independence to adjudicate upon a lis it has taken cognisance of. When a Bench is seized of a case and has partly heard it, the matter becomes part of judicial proceedings, and the Bench hearing the case assumes exclusive jurisdiction over it. Any interference whether through withdrawal or reassignment without judicial justification undermines the principle of judicial independence. 15. The said practice imposes a significant limitation on the administrative powers of the Chief Justice. While the Chief Justice has the authority to regulate the formation of Benches and allocate cases as an administrative function, these powers do not extend to withdrawing or transferring a part-heard case from a Bench that has already assumed jurisdiction. Such withdrawal or reassignment is not merely an administrative act but a judicial one. Consequently, any such action must either stem from a judicial order passed by the Bench seized of the matter or be supported by express statutory authority if carried out by another court or authority. 16. The principles of judicial propriety and case continuity require that a Bench, once seized of a case, must see it through to its conclusion, barring exceptional circumstances. Arbitrary withdrawal or reassignment of a case after it has been partly heard sets a dangerous precedent, Crl.0.P. No. 1 of 2025. 12 undermines the sanctity of judicial proceedings and erodes public confidence in the judiciary. Exceptional circumstances that may justify the reassignment of a case include instances where the Bench seized of the matter makes a judicial request for reassignment due to recusal, conflict of interest or other valid reasons. As the decision regarding the withdrawal or reassignment of a case partakes of the character of judicial process. Such decisions cannot rely solely on administrative discretion, as this would compromise the finality and integrity of judicial orders. These principles collectively affirm that the sanctity of judicial proceedings takes precedence over administrative powers, thereby safeguarding the impartiality and independence of the judiciary. 17. For almost similar reasons that create a bar on the power of assignment of cases concerning the withdrawal and reassignment of partheard cases, this Court held in Human Rights Case No. 14959-K of 2018 PLD 2019 SC 183 that a similar limitation also applies to the constitution of benches. It was held and observed in that case: The above Rule of Order XI of the Supreme Court Rules 18980 provides for administrative powers of the Chief Justice to constitute benches. However, once the bench is constituted, cause list is issued and the bench starts hearing the cases, the matter regarding constitution of the bench goes outside the pale of administrative powers of the Chief Justice and rest on the judicial side, with the bench. Any member of the bench may, however, recuse to hear a case for personal reasons or may not be available to sit on the bench due to prior commitments or due to illness. The bench may also be reconstituted if it is against the Rules and requires a three-member bench instead of two. In such eventualities the bench passes an order to place the matter before the Chief Justice to nominate a new bench. Therefore, once a bench has been constituted, cause list issued and the bench is assembled for hearing cases, the Chief Justice cannot reconstitute the bench, except in the manner discussed above. 7. In the absence of a recusal by a member of the Bench, any amount of disagreement amongst the members of the Bench, on an issue before them, cannot form a valid ground for reconstitution of the Bench. Any reconstitution of the Bench on this ground would impinge on the constitutional value of independence of judiciary. The construct of judicial system is pillared on the assumption that every judge besides being fair and impartial is fiercely independent and is free to uphold his judicial view. This judicial freedom is foundational to the concept of Rule of Law. Reconstitution of a bench while hearing a case, in the absence of any recusal from any member on the bench or due to any other reason described above, would amount to stifling the independent view of the judge. Any effort to muffle disagreement or to silence dissent or to dampen an alternative viewpoint of a member on the bench, would shake the foundations of a free and impartial justice system, thereby eroding the public confidence on which the entire edifice of judicature stands. Crl.0.P. No. 1 of 2025. 13 Public confidence is the most precious asset that this branch of the State has. It is also one of the most precious assets of the nation. Emphasis added While relying on the above observations in the case of Muhammad Imtiyaz, this Court reiterated that the arbitrary reconstitution of Benches undermines the integrity of the judicial system and may have serious repercussions. If Benches are changed arbitrarily without justifiable reasons, it creates doubts and raises concerns about the fairness of the system. The public may question the impartiality of a judicial process that appears arbitrary. To uphold the rule of law, transparency and fairness in the matters of the constitution of Benches and the assignment of cases is imperative to maintain the independence, integrity and prestige of this Court. 18. We may mention here that it was argued before us that the cases concerning the powers of the Chief Justice, decided prior to the promulgation of the Act, have become irrelevant following the establishment of the Bench Constitution Committee under Section 2 of the Act, which has been endorsed by the Full Court of the Supreme Court on the judicial side in the case of Raja Amer. We, however, are not persuaded by this argument for the simple reason that it was categorically held in Raja Amer that the powers of the Committee under Section 2 of the Act are the same as those previously exercised by the Chief Justice. The relevant observation is as follows: Both the powers of suo motu invoking original jurisdiction and constituting benches were earlier being exercised by one person, the Chief Justice; it is these administrative powers that have now been conferred on the Committee comprising three persons, i.e., the Chief Justice and the two most senior Judges - nothing more nothing less. Therefore, whatever was stated in the referred cases regarding the powers of the Chief Justice to assign or withdraw cases from Benches fully applies to the Committees as well. 19. In view of the settled jurisprudence of the subcontinent on the constitution of Benches and the assignment of cases discussed above, we answer question i in the negative. We hold that the Committees constituted under Sections 2 of the Act and 191A of the Constitution lack 7 Muhammad Imtiyaz v. Muhammad Naeem PLD 2023 SC 306. 8 Raja Amer v. Federation of Pakistan PLJ 2024 SC 114 2024 SCP 91 . Ibid, per Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, J., para 30 Majority Judgment . Crl.0.P. No. 1 of 2025. 14 the authority to withdraw a case that has been partly heard, where cognisance has already been taken by a regular Bench, and transfer it to another Bench, unless the Bench itself refers the case to the Committees for its assignment to another Bench for some justifiable reason. Such partly heard cases may include those where serious questions of constitutional law concerning the jurisdiction of the regular Bench have been framed, some arguments on those questions have been heard and the hearing has been adjourned for further arguments. ii Whether the said Committees can, by an administrative order, undo the effect of a judicial order, whereby next date of hearing a specific case has been fixed before a reqular Bench to hear arguments on the jurisdiction of the regular Bench. 20. This question need not detain us long, as a similar issue was addressed and decided by a Full Court of this Court in the case of Malik Asad Ali.! It was held in the said case that an administrative order passed by the Hon ble Chief Justice acting under restraint passed in derogation of a judicial order would be without lawful authority and of no legal effect. In that case, the Chief Justice s administrative declaration, which sought to invalidate the convening of a Full Court under a judicial order of a Bench for hearing cases listed in Supplementary Cause List No. 405 of 1997, was declared illegal. 21. The above cited observations of a seven-member Bench of this Court in the contempt case against Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani are equally relevant. It was observed therein that the executive authority may question a Court s decision through the judicial process provided for in the Constitution and the law but is not entitled to flout it because it believes it to be inconsistent with the law or the Constitution. This principle applies with equal force to the executive authority of the Chief Justice or the Committees, as the case may be. 22. Therefore, it can be held unequivocally that no administrative authority, including the Committees constituted under Section 2 of the Act and 191A of the Constitution, can, by an administrative order, undo the effect of a judicial order. Question ii is answered accordingly. 23. We may mention here that it was also argued before us that the Committees did not pass any administrative orders to undo the effect of 10 Malik Asad Ali v. Federation of Pakistan 1998 SCMR 130 and PLD 1998 S.C. 161. Crl.0.P. No. 1 of 2025. 15 the judicial orders. Instead, it was contended, the cases were transferred to the Constitutional Bench through the operation of law under Clause 4 of Article 191A, which states that all petitions, appeals or review applications against judgments rendered or orders passed, to which Clause 3 applies, pending or filed in the Supreme Court prior to the commencement of the Constitution Twenty-sixth Amendment Act 2024, stand transferred to the Constitutional Bench. However, we find this argument misconceived, and it is sufficiently answered by the formulation provided by Khawaja Haris Ahmad, the learned amicus curiae. For ease of reference, his formulation is again reproduced here: It is noteworthy that when, on 13.01.2025, the learned Bench took up the matter relating to its jurisdiction to entertain and decide the CPLAs filed under Article 185 3 of the Constitution fixed before it, this involved neither assuming jurisdiction over the merits of the CPLAs, nor decision of constitutionality of any law point involved in the CPLAs. Rather, in effect, it only took upon itself the task of ascertaining if Article 191A 3 could be so construed as to exclude the Bench s jurisdiction to hear the CPLAs. To do so, the learned Bench was dealing with the matter like any other case where question of jurisdiction is raised - i.e. i first looking at the wording of the provision itself to see if it per se excluded the Court s jurisdiction; and, ii if so, to see whether the provision of law relied upon for excluding the Court s jurisdiction constitutes valid law or not. Thus, in the instant case, the learned Bench would first examine the words of Article 191A 3 to ascertain if a plain reading of it excludes the Court s jurisdiction in the matter; and, if such exclusion is a necessary consequence, then the Court would proceed to ascertain the constitutional validity of Article 191A 3 . Prima facie it appears that the aforesaid exercise in not covered by exclusionary provisions of Article 191A 3 of the Constitution. As evident from the above, the three-member Bench that passed the order dated 13 January 2025 was not deliberating on the constitutionality of the law challenged in those cases but was addressing the jurisdictional question, which every court inherently has the power to adjudicate. The Bench, which had previously referred such cases to the Constitutional Bench, was confronted with the principles governing a court s inherent power to decide jurisdictional questions. When the argument was prima facie supported by the referred precedents of the cases of Pir Sabir Shah, Fazlul Quader Chowdhry and Marbury, the Bench decided to adjudicate the jurisdictional matter after obtaining full assistance from the learned counsel for the parties, and the cases were adjourned to allow for further preparation and assistance on the jurisdictional issue. 24. In Pir Sabir Shah, the Court addressed the jurisdictional question of whether appeals filed before it under Section 8-B of the Political Parties Crl.0.P. No. 1 of 2025. 16 Act, 1962, were competent and whether that provision was ultra vires the Constitution. Similarly, in Fazlul Quader Chowdhry, the Court dealt with the question of whether Clause 4 of Article 224 of the 1962 Constitution, which barred all courts from questioning the validity of constitutional amendments, was ultra vires the Constitution. The principle emerging from these cases is that if a dispute arises concerning a court s jurisdiction over a particular matter, the court has the power to hear and determine that dispute even if its conclusion leads to the finding that it lacks jurisdiction. Moreover, in determining its jurisdiction, the court may examine the constitutionality of the law, including any constitutional provision, that confers or bars its jurisdiction. Based on this principle, the Bench that passed the order dated 13 January 2025 was acting within its jurisdiction. If, ultimately, it had determined that Article 191A validly excluded its jurisdiction, it would have transferred the cases to the Constitutional Bench in accordance with Clause 5 of Article 191A of the Constitution, and would not have proceeded to address the matter of the constitutionality of the law challenged in those cases. 25. For these reasons, we find that it was the administrative decisions of the Committees that illegally nullified the judicial orders and unlawfully deprived the regular Bench of its judicial power to decide the jurisdictional question raised before it. Such jurisdictional questions, as contended by Khawaja Haris Ahmad, do not fall within the ambit of Clauses 3 and 5 of Article 191A of the Constitution. 26. As both the above questions have been answered in the negative. We are sanguine that the office shall fix the main case i.e. CPLA No. 836-K of 2020, etc before the original three-member bench comprising Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Ayesha A. Malik, and Irfan Saadat Khan, JJ. in the first week of February 2025. Decision on the Explanation of the Alleged Contemner 27. Having answered the questions of law, we now turn to the validity of the explanation furnished by the alleged contemner in response to the show-cause notice. Under Section 17 3 of the Contempt of Court Ordinance 2003, we must determine whether the interests of justice require further action and whether a charge for contempt of court should be framed against him. As required by law, the alleged contemner was given an opportunity for a preliminary hearing, and we have duly Crl.0.P. No. 1 of 2025. 17 considered his written reply, along with the documents filed in support thereof. 28. It has become evident from the record that in compliance with the court order dated 16 January 2025, the alleged contemner initiated a note on the same day 16 January 2025 regarding the constitution of a Special Bench comprising the Judges mentioned in the said order. However, the Committee constituted under Section 2 of the Act, by a majority comprising the Hon ble Chief Justice and Hon ble Justice Aminud-Din Khan, passed an order on 17 January 2025, withdrawing the cases from the regular Bench and directing that they be placed before the Committee constituted under Article 191A of the Constitution for fixation before the Constitutional Bench. 29. We find that the alleged contemner did what he could to comply with the court order. As stated in his written reply, he had no authority to constitute the Bench of Judges as mentioned in the court order. At most, he could inform the Competent Authority, which was done by him not only in a timely manner but also with a proposal for the constitution of the Special Bench comprising the Judges specified in the court order, for the fixation of cases before it as directed. The alleged contemner s failure to fix the case before the Bench specified in the court order, therefore, does not constitute a contumacious act on his part. 30. Inacontempt appeal by the Registrar of the High Court of Sindh,!! a fourteen-member larger Bench of this Court drew a distinction between a case of contempt against a party to the case and a case of contempt against an officer of the Court, in the following words: A distinction has to be made between a case of contempt of Court based on defiance or violation of a judicial order in the nature of temporary injunction by a party whereby such party was restrained from acting in a particular manner but in spite of service of notice or having come to know of the passing of such order, acts in a manner to alter the position to his advantage so as to frustrate the temporary injunction and an act of mere non-submission of a report called for by the Court by an Officer of the Court. In the former case, the Court would take strict view and mere act of defiance of the judicial order would by itself justify raising of presumption that the doer of the act was guilty of contempt of Court unless he proves otherwise whereas in the latter case, it has to be determined on application of judicial mind as to whether the accused deliberately did not submit the report on account of having personal interest in any of the parties to cause damage to the other party in the case in ! In re: Muhammad Sadiq Leghari, Registrar High Court of Sindh PLD 2002 SC 1033. Crl.0.P. No. 1 of 2025. 18 which the report was called or had any personal interest which, if proved or established, would make the act of non-submission of the report mala fide. In the absence of any of these factors and element of contumacy, his conduct could not be held to have suffered from mala fides or contempt of Court. Mere non-compliance of an order, in the absence of contumacy, would not amount to contempt of Court. Per Rana Bhagwandas, J. Additional note It may be pertinent to observe further that every failure to comply with an order may not amount to be criminal contempt warranting action therefor. There may be cases where there are justifiable reasons or causes for non adherence of an order of a Court which would depend on the facts of each case. There may also be cases where non-compliance of the order was not wilful or deliberate. Likewise, there may be instances where compliance with an order of a Court may be beyond the scope of authority of a person to whom it is directed. Each-case, therefore, has to be examined in its proper perspective having regard to the facts and circumstances of a case. Emphasis added Upon examining the case of the present alleged contemner, the Additional Registrar Judicial of this Court, we find that he did not deliberately avoid the fixation of the cases before the Bench as directed in the court order. There is no evidence to suggest that he had any personal interest in the matter or had connived with any of the parties to the case, nor did he act with the intention of causing damage to any of the parties to the case. There is no indication of mala fide intent in his actions. In the absence of any such factors or elements of contumacy, his conduct cannot be considered contumacious, nor can it be said to have suffered from mala fides, requiring contempt proceedings against him. For these reasons, by accepting his explanation, the show-cause notice issued against him for contempt proceeding is discharged. Contempt Proceedings Against the Members of the Committees 31. We have also deliberated on the question of whether, following the discharge of the show-cause notice against the alleged contemner, the Additional Registrar Judicial , the matter should be considered concluded or whether it should proceed further against the members of the two Committees, where the first Committee unlawfully withdrew the partheard cases from a Bench and transferred it for the consideration of the other Committee, through an administrative order by undoing the effect of a judicial order. While the second Committee, in total disregard of the judicial order passed by the regular Bench, simply in pursuance of the direction of the first Committee, went ahead and fixed the case before the Constitutional Bench on 27 January 2025. Both the Committees were not Crl.0.P. No. 1 of 2025. 19 legally authorized to take administrative decisions dated 17 January 2025 in violation of the judicial order. In this background, it appears that the matter has to proceed further against the members of the two Committees. However, judicial propriety and decorum demand that the said question be considered and decided by the Full Court of the Supreme Court so that it is authoritatively decided once and for all. We note with advantage that the matter of contempt proceedings against the Registrar of a High Court! was treated with such gravity that a larger bench of 14 Judges was convened to adjudicate it. Therefore, in our view, this issue is even more serious, warranting the collective and institutional deliberation of all Judges of this Court. Consequently, we refer this matter to the Hon ble Chief Justice for the convening of the Full Court to deliberate and decide on this important issue. 32. We may clarify here that we have not referred this matter to the Committee constituted under Section 2 of the Act, as its authority is limited to constituting benches of the Supreme Court. The Full Court of the Supreme Court, however, is constituted by the Constitution itself under Article 176. The distinction between the benches of a Court and the Full Court is well-established and constitutionally recognised in the provisions of Article 203J 2 c and d of the Constitution and the responsibility of convening the Full Court conventionally falls within the domain of the Chief Justice. 33. Before parting with this judgment, we find it necessary to acknowledge and express our appreciation for the invaluable assistance rendered to us by all the learned amici curiae, especially on such short notice.

            "Sentences": [
                "ORDER The underlying facts that have given rise to an unsavoury situation are that a three-member Bench of this Court comprising Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Ayesha A. Malik, and Irfan Saadat Khan, JJ.",
                "heard certain cases CPLA No. 836-K of 2020, etc.",
                "At the outset of the proceedings, an objection was raised regarding the Bench s jurisdiction to hear these cases, which involved a challenge to the constitutionality of a law, on the basis of Article 191A of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan Constitution .",
                "After hearing arguments of the learned counsel on the jurisdictional objection, the Bench adjourned the hearing to 16 January 2025 by allowing time to the learned counsel for the parties to make preparation to further assist the Court on the points concerning the jurisdictional objection.",
                "The order dated 13 January 2025 is reproduced below: At the very outset, the learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the present regular bench of the Court cannot hear these cases, as they involve a challenge to the constitutionality of a law, namely, subsection 2 of Section 221-A of the Customs Act, 1969.",
                "When asked why this bench cannot hear these cases, the learned counsel referred to the provisions of Article 191A, which was added to the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan through the 26th Constitutional Amendment.",
                "In response to the petitioners objection regarding the lack of jurisdiction of the present bench of the Court, the learned counsel for the respondents contended that Article Crl.0.P.",
                "2 191A, the basis of the objection regarding jurisdiction, is constitutionally invalid as it infringes upon the salient features of the Constitution, including the independence of the judiciary and the separation of powers among the three organs of the State.",
                "He further submitted that a constitutionally invalid amendment cannot oust the constitutionally valid conferment of jurisdiction on the regular benches of the Court.",
                "When asked how the present bench of the Court can decide upon the constitutional validity of the newly added Article 191A, the learned counsel for the respondents took the position that since the objection raised and the basis thereof pertain to the jurisdiction of the present bench, it must be decided by it.",
                "In support of his stance, he referred to Sabir Shah v. Shad Muhammad Khan PLD 1995 SC 66 , Fazlul Quader Chowdhry v. Abdul Haque PLD 1963 SC 486 and Marbury v. Madison 5 US 137 1803 and sought time to further assist the Court on this point.",
                "Given the objection raised and the reply thereto, we find that it would be necessary to first decide upon the same before proceeding further in the matter at hand.",
                "Therefore, the learned counsel for the parties are granted time to prepare their arguments and assist the Court on the said points.",
                "The hearing for arguments on those points is adjourned to 16.01.2025.",
                "On 16 January 2025, the three-member Bench stood reconstituted, with Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi, J., replacing Irfan Saadat Khan, J., and the said cases were posted before the reconstituted Bench.",
                "However, the reconstituted Bench could not proceed with the hearing, as Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi, J., was one of the two judges who had delivered the impugned judgment in these cases in the High Court of Sindh.",
                "Consequently, the reconstituted Bench comprising Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Ayesha A. Malik and Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi, JJ.",
                "directed the office, by its order dated 16 January 2025, to fix these cases before the earlier Bench on Monday, 20 January 2025, at 1:00 pm.",

Malik and Mr. Justice Irfan Saadat Khan and were posted for 16.01.2025, however, the bench today cannot hear this matter, as the impugned judgment has been authored by one of us Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi, J. .",

                "The Deputy Registrar confirmed that the cases had not been fixed on that day, i.e., 20 January 2025 before any regular Bench but had instead been fixed for hearing before the Constitutional Bench on 27 January 2025, pursuant to the decision of the Committee constituted under the Supreme Court Practice and Procedure Act, 2023 Act .",
                "He further submitted that the decision of the Committee had not yet been communicated to the office, in writing.",
                "Upon receiving information of these facts, the said Bench initiated suo motu contempt proceedings against the Additional Registrar Judicial for defiance of the court order and for obstructing the administration of justice.",
                "The Bench, while calling for his explanation, fixed the hearing of the contempt proceedings for 21 January 2025 by its order dated 20 January 2025.",
                "Relevant paragraphs 4 and 5 of the order dated 20 January 2025 are reproduced below: 4.",
                "It is a sad state of affairs that a judicial order of this Court has been ignored by the office and the cases put up before the Committee for a decision, despite the precedents of this Court to the contrary reported as Asad Ali v.

                "On 21 January 2025, in response to the notice issued to the Additional Registrar Judicial of this Court, the Registrar of the Court appeared on behalf of the Additional Registrar Judicial , who was reported to be indisposed.",
                "The Registrar presented copies of two decisions made by two different Committees: first, the decision of the Committee constituted under Section 2 of the Act; and second, the decision of the Committee Crl.0.P.",
                "4 constituted under Article 191A of the Constitution.",
                "He stated that the Committee constituted under Section 2 of the Act convened its meeting on 17 January 2025 and, by a majority decision, resolved to withdraw the said cases from the regular Bench and refer them to the Committee established under Article 191A of the Constitution.",
                "Subsequently, the latter Committee convened its meeting on the same date, i.e., 17 January 2025, and directed that all cases challenging the vires of the 26th Constitutional Amendment and vires of law be fixed for hearing before the Constitutional Bench on 27 January 2025.",
                "He explained that, because of these decisions by the two Committees, the said cases were not fixed by the office for hearing on 20 January 2025 before the regular Bench.",
                "The explanation provided by the Registrar, coupled with the contention raised by Mr. Salahuddin, ASC counsel for one of the respondents in the said cases , gave rise to the following substantial questions of law of public importance: i Whether the Committees constituted under Section 2 of the Act and Article 191A of the Constitution have the authority to withdraw a case from a Bench , in which cognisance has already been taken by a regular Bench and serious questions of constitutional law relating to the jurisdiction of the regular Bench have been framed; and ii Whether the said Committees can, by an administrative order, undo the effect of a judicial order, whereby next date of hearing a specific case has been fixed before a regular Bench to hear arguments on the jurisdiction of the regular Bench .",
                "The Court observed that uJnder Article 190 of the Constitution, all executive and judicial authorities throughout Pakistan, including officers within the establishment of this Court, are required to act in aid of the Supreme Court, meaning in aid of its judicial orders, not administrative orders.",
                "Furthermore, in accordance with the constitutional mandate of Article 5 of the Constitution, every citizen, including officers within the establishment of this Court, is bound to obey the Constitution and the law.",
                "Accordingly, the legality of the explanation put forth by the Registrar, as well as the outcome of the present contempt proceedings, hinges upon the determination of the aforementioned questions.",
                "In light of the significance of the questions involved, the Court appointed Mr. Hamid Khan, Sr. ASC, and Mr. Muneer A. Malik, Sr. ASC, as amici curiae to assist in addressing the aforementioned questions.",

                "The Court also appointed two additional amici curiae, Mr. Ahsan Bhoon, ASC, and Khawaja Haris Ahmad, ASC, to assist in addressing the said questions, and adjourned the hearing to 23 January 2025.",

                "The responsibility of the answering respondent at the most is to apprise the Competent Authority to the non-availability of any appropriate bench, which has been not only conveyed before time but also has been suggested to be met with by formation of special Bench so there is no lapse on the part of the answering respondent in the whole scenario.",
                "That act of the office regarding non-fixation of the case before the Bench, was neither deliberate not wilful, it was in pursuance of the decisions taken by the two Committees.",

                "Preliminary points regarding the jurisdiction of the Benches that passed the orders dated 13 and 16 January 2025 8.",
                "First, we find it appropriate to address two preliminary points raised before us regarding the jurisdiction of the Benches that passed the orders dated 13 and 16 January 2025.",
                "The first point raised was that the three-member Bench, which passed the order dated 13 January 2025, lacked jurisdiction to hear cases involving a challenge to the constitutionality of a law, as such matters fall within the exclusive domain of the Constitutional Bench under Article 191A of the Constitution.",
                "It was also argued that the said Bench could not examine the vires of the 26th Constitutional Amendment, whereby Article 191A was added to the Constitution, as this too falls within the exclusive domain of the Constitutional Bench under Article 191A.",
                "The said point was also rebutted before us with the submissions that the Bench which passed the order dated 13 January 2025 had not commenced hearing the matter concerning the constitutionality of the law.",
                "Instead, it was hearing arguments on the objection raised to its jurisdiction to entertain such matters based on Article 191A.",
                "Furthermore, the Bench was also deliberating on whether it could examine the constitutionality of Article 191A itself, as the objection to its jurisdiction was rooted in that very Article.",
                "Thus, the Bench was addressing the jurisdictional question rather than the substantive matter of the constitutionality of the law involved in the cases before it.",
                "Since Khawaja Haris Ahmad, the learned amicus curia, has provided his written articulation on this point, we find it expedient to reproduce the relevant portion here: It is noteworthy that when, on 13.01.2025, the learned Bench took up the matter relating to its jurisdiction to entertain and decide the CPLAs filed under Article 185 3 of the Constitution fixed before it, this involved neither assuming jurisdiction over the merits of the CPLAs, nor decision of constitutionality of any law point involved in the CPLAs.",
                "Rather, in effect, it only took upon itself the task of ascertaining if Article 191A 3 could be so construed as to exclude the Bench s jurisdiction to hear the CPLAs.",
                "To do so, the learned Bench was dealing with the matter like any other case where question of jurisdiction is raised - i.e.",
                "i first looking at the wording of the provision itself to see if it per se excluded the Court s jurisdiction; and, ii if so, to see whether the provision of law relied upon for excluding the Court s jurisdiction constitutes valid law or not.",
                "Thus, in the instant case, the learned Bench would first examine the words of Article 191A 3 to ascertain if a plain reading of it excludes the Court s jurisdiction in the matter; and, if such exclusion is a necessary consequence, then the Court would proceed to ascertain the constitutional validity of Article 191A 3 .",
                "Prima facie it appears that the aforesaid exercise in not covered by exclusionary provisions of Article 191A 3 of the Constitution.",
                "Similarly, Mr. Shahid Jamil Khan, ASC, adopted the same stance.",
                "In addition to the cases of Pir Sabir Shah,!",
                "referred to by Barrister Salahuddin, he also cited extracts from Justice Fazal Karim s Judicial Review of Public Actions 2nd Edition, Volume 3, pages 1403-1406 , where the learned author has discussed several cases from American, English and Pakistani jurisdictions on this point.",
                "The second point raised was that the three-member Bench, which passed the order dated 16 January 2025 directing the office to fix certain Pir Sabir Shah v. Shad Muhammad Khan PLD 1995 SC 66. ?",

                "We, however, are not persuaded by this argument for the simple reason that it was categorically held in Raja Amer that the powers of the Committee under Section 2 of the Act are the same as those previously exercised by the Chief Justice.",

                "For ease of reference, his formulation is again reproduced here: It is noteworthy that when, on 13.01.2025, the learned Bench took up the matter relating to its jurisdiction to entertain and decide the CPLAs filed under Article 185 3 of the Constitution fixed before it, this involved neither assuming jurisdiction over the merits of the CPLAs, nor decision of constitutionality of any law point involved in the CPLAs.",
                "Rather, in effect, it only took upon itself the task of ascertaining if Article 191A 3 could be so construed as to exclude the Bench s jurisdiction to hear the CPLAs.",
                "To do so, the learned Bench was dealing with the matter like any other case where question of jurisdiction is raised - i.e.",
                "i first looking at the wording of the provision itself to see if it per se excluded the Court s jurisdiction; and, ii if so, to see whether the provision of law relied upon for excluding the Court s jurisdiction constitutes valid law or not.",
                "Thus, in the instant case, the learned Bench would first examine the words of Article 191A 3 to ascertain if a plain reading of it excludes the Court s jurisdiction in the matter; and, if such exclusion is a necessary consequence, then the Court would proceed to ascertain the constitutional validity of Article 191A 3 .",
                "Prima facie it appears that the aforesaid exercise in not covered by exclusionary provisions of Article 191A 3 of the Constitution.",
                "As evident from the above, the three-member Bench that passed the order dated 13 January 2025 was not deliberating on the constitutionality of the law challenged in those cases but was addressing the jurisdictional question, which every court inherently has the power to adjudicate.",
                "The Bench, which had previously referred such cases to the Constitutional Bench, was confronted with the principles governing a court s inherent power to decide jurisdictional questions.",

                "In Pir Sabir Shah, the Court addressed the jurisdictional question of whether appeals filed before it under Section 8-B of the Political Parties Crl.0.P.",
                "16 Act, 1962, were competent and whether that provision was ultra vires the Constitution.",
                "Similarly, in Fazlul Quader Chowdhry, the Court dealt with the question of whether Clause 4 of Article 224 of the 1962 Constitution, which barred all courts from questioning the validity of constitutional amendments, was ultra vires the Constitution.",
                "The principle emerging from these cases is that if a dispute arises concerning a court s jurisdiction over a particular matter, the court has the power to hear and determine that dispute even if its conclusion leads to the finding that it lacks jurisdiction.",
                "Moreover, in determining its jurisdiction, the court may examine the constitutionality of the law, including any constitutional provision, that confers or bars its jurisdiction.",
                "Based on this principle, the Bench that passed the order dated 13 January 2025 was acting within its jurisdiction.",
                "If, ultimately, it had determined that Article 191A validly excluded its jurisdiction, it would have transferred the cases to the Constitutional Bench in accordance with Clause 5 of Article 191A of the Constitution, and would not have proceeded to address the matter of the constitutionality of the law challenged in those cases.",
                "For these reasons, we find that it was the administrative decisions of the Committees that illegally nullified the judicial orders and unlawfully deprived the regular Bench of its judicial power to decide the jurisdictional question raised before it.",

Let the\nneedful be done by tomorrow i.e. 23.01.2025. It is clarified that on\n21.01.2025 the Registrar of the Court had tendered appearance on\nbehalf of Mr. Nazar Abbas and submitted on his behalf that the case\nwas not fixed on 20.01.2025 because of the two decisions of the\nCommittees constituted under Section 2 of the Supreme Court\n(Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023 (the “2023 Act”) and Article\n191(A)(4) of the Constitution. Hence the defence presented by the\nRegistrar on behalf of the Additional Registrar were the two\nCommittees decisions dated 17.01.2025.\n\n2. The learned Attorney General for Pakistan has pointed out\nthat the amicus curiae appointed by this Court yesterday are already\ncounsel in cases challenging the 26‘ Constitutional Amendment\nbefore the Constitutional Bench. Be that as it may, the question before\nus is the scope of Section 2 of the 2023 Act and does not directly relate\nto the 26th Constitutional Amendment. Even otherwise, we have asked\nthe learned A.G.P. to suggest other names for appointing as amicus\ncuriae, who are not associated with the challenge laid against the 26th\nConstitutional Amendment.

Mr. Shahid Jamil Khan, learned ASC, representing\nrespondents in the main case tendered appearance and requested to\nassist the Court on the question framed by the Court vide order dated\n21.01.2025. He referred to Articles 204(c) and 175(2) of the\nConstitution to submit that the jurisdiction under Article 187\n(Complete Justice) is also available to the Bench and hence the\ndecisions of the Committee can be examined by the Bench. He submits\nthat the administrative order cannot override a judicial order and to\nthe extent of inconsistency the administrative order is void and non\nest. He has placed reliance on para-43 of case reported as Malik Asad\nAli_and_others_vs. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Law,\n\nJustice _and_ Parliament Affairs, Islamabad_and_ others (PLD 1998 SC\n\n161), Human Right case in the matter regarding disposal of infectious\nwastes in the Province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (PLD 2019 SC 183) and\nMuhammad Imtiyaz vs. Ch. Muhammad Naeem and others (PLD 2023\nSC 306). Walking us through the Supreme Court (Practice and\n\nProcedure) Act, 2023, the learned counsel read Sections 2 and 2A and\nsubmitted that all the cases pending in the Supreme Court must first\nbe taken-up by the original Committee under Section 2 of the 2023 Act\nand if the question arises before that Committee whether a case ought\nto be heard by the Constitutional Bench or the Regular Bench it ought\nto be referred to the Committee constituted under Article 191A of the\nConstitution under Section 2A.

Mr. Munir A. Malik, learned counsel has tendered\nappearance as amicus curiae. He submits that two fundamental\nquestions arise in this case: (i). that all the cases pending in the\nSupreme Court are to be first examined by the Committee constituted\nunder Section 2 the 2023 Act and only if a question arises that the\nmatter ought to be sent to the Committee constituted under Article\n191A(4) of the Constitution (Section 2A of the Supreme Court (Practice\nand Procedure) Act, 2023), can the case be sent to the said Committee.\n(ii). that judicial order cannot be trumped by an administrative order\nbecause that directly affects the independence of the judiciary. He\n\nadded that a case being heard by a Bench cannot be withdrawn\n\nCrl.0.P. No.1/2025 3\n\nthrough an administrative order. He submits that these questions are\nof fundamental importance and go to the root of the independence of\nthe judiciary and submits that it ought to be heard by a Full Court of\nthis Court so that the matter is settled once and for all. When asked\nwhether such an order can be passed in contempt proceedings, he\nsubmits it can be as in the present case the very defence presented by\nthe accused person is that the case was not fixed before the Court\nbecause of the decisions of the two Committees dated 17.01.2025.\n\n5. Mr. Hamid Khan, learned counsel has_ tendered\nappearance as amicus curiae and has referred to para-4 of the order\npassed by this Court on 21.01.2025. He read out the two questions of\npublic importance framed in the said paragraph. Rephrasing the two\nquestions he submits; i). whether a judicial order and _ its\nimplementation can be undone or varied by a Committee exercising\nadministrative and procedural powers of the Court; and ii). whether a\nconstitutional question coming-up before a Bench of the Court could\nbe decided by it or referred to a Full Court for its determination. He\nthen referred to Articles 175 and 176 of the Constitution to submit\nthat the Supreme Court has been constituted under Article 175 and\nits constitution has been described under Article 176 of the\nConstitution. Both these Articles read together do not envisage any\ndivisibility within the Supreme Court regarding the exercise of judicial\npower.

Subsequently, the latter Committee convened its meeting on\nthe same date, i.e., 17.01.2025, and directed that all cases challenging the\nvires of the 26th Constitutional Amendment be fixed for hearing before the\nConstitutional Bench on 27.01.2025. He explained that, because of these\ndecisions of the two Committees, the aforementioned cases were not be\n\nfixed by the office for hearing on 20.01.2025 before the regular Bench.\n\nCri. O. P_1 of 2025, etc 2\n\n3. Mr. Salahuddin Ahmed, counsel for the respondents (CPLA 836-\nK/2022), has submitted that the vires of the 26th Constitutional\nAmendment were not challenged in the cases being heard by the regular\nBench; rather, the issue under consideration was limited solely to the\njurisdictional bar of regular Benches under Article 191A of the\nConstitution. Therefore, it appears that the said cases do not fall within\nthe purview of the decision rendered by the Committee established under\nArticle 191A of the Constitution. Even otherwise, he submitted, the\nCommittee established under Article 191A of the Constitution is required\nto pass a speaking order to determine whether the matter should be placed\nbefore the Constitutional Bench or a regular Bench as required under\nSection 2A of the Act. He has further submitted that there are two\npreliminary issues involved in the proceedings. First, the explanation\nadvanced by the Registrar is that the case was not fixed before this Court\ndue to the decisions of the Committees constituted under Section 2 of the\nAct and under Article 191A of the Constitution, both dated 17.01.2025.\nTherefore, the legal validity of the explanation of the Registrar must be\nexamined and determined by the Court. Second, whether the decisions of\nthe Committees taken on the administrative side cannot undo the effect of\na judicial order. In support of this contention, learned counsel relied upon\nMalik Asad Ali v. Federation of Pakistan (1998 SCMR 15, 1998 SCMR 130,\nPLD 1998 S.C. 161) and Human Rights Case No.14959-K (PLD 2019 S.C.\n183). Additionally, he cited the unreported order dated 21.05.2024 passed\nby the Islamabad High Court, Islamabad, in W.P. No. 3061/2022, titled\nMuhammad Sajid v. Imran Khan. He also placed reliance on Nusrat Bhutto\nv. Chief of the army staff (PLD 1977 SC 657), Syed Zafar Ali Shah v. General\nPervez Musharaf (PLD 2000 S.C. 869), and CUJP Iftikhar Muhammad\nChaudhry v. President of Pakistan (PLD 2010 S.C. 61) to contend that the\njudicial powers of this Court cannot be taken away through administrative\norders. Lastly, learned counsel submitted that the issue at hand affects\nthe judicial powers of all judges of this Court. Therefore, propriety\ndemands that this matter be placed before the Full Court. In support of\nthis contention, learned counsel referred to Justice Qazi Faez Isa v.\nPresident of Pakistan (2019 SCMR 1875), CJP Iftikhar Muhammad\nChaudhry v. President of Pakistan (PLD 2010 S.C. 61) and Malik Asad Ali\nv. Federation of Pakistan (PLD 1998 S.C. 161).\n\nCri. O. P_1 of 2025, etc 3\n\n4. The above contentions of the learned counsel have given rise to the\nfollowing substantial questions of law of public importance:\n\n(i) whether the Committees constituted under Section 2 of the Act\nand Article 191A of the Constitution have the authority to withdraw\na case in which cognisance has already been taken by a regular\nbench and serious questions of constitutional law relating to the\njurisdicition of the regular Bench have been framed; and\n\n(ii) whether the said Committees can, by an administrative order,\nundo the effect of a judicial order, whereby next date of hearing a\nspecific case has been fixed before a regular Bench.\n\nUnder Article 190 of the Constitution, all executive and judicial authorities\nthroughout Pakistan, including officers within the establishment of this\nCourt, are required to act in aid of the Supreme Court, meaning in aid of\nits judicial orders, not administrative orders. Furthermore, in accordance\nwith the constitutional mandate of Article 5 of the Constitution, every\ncitizen, including officers within the establishment of this Court, is bound\nto obey the Constitution and the law. Accordingly, the legality of the\nexplanation put forth by the Registrar, as well as the outcome of the\npresent contempt proceedings, hinges upon the determination of the\n\naforementioned questions.\n\n5. In light of the significance of the questions involved, we hereby\nappoint Mr. Hamid Khan, Sr. ASC, and Mr. Muneer A. Malik, Sr. ASC, as\namici curiae to assist the Court in addressing the aforementioned\nquestions. Further, Mr. Shahid Jamil Khan, ASC, has also sought\npermission to assist the Court in the matter. As he represents one of the\nrespondents in the main cases, his request is granted. Notice is also issued\nto learned Attorney General for Pakistan to conduct these proceedings as\n\nwell as assist the Court on the above questions.\n\n6. The hearing is adjourned to tomorrow, i.e., 22.01.2025, for\n\narguments on the above questions.\n\nJudge\nIslamabad, Judge\n21 January 2025.\nApproved for reporting.\n\nIqbal",
