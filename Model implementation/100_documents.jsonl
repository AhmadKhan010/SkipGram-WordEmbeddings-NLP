The appellants are aggrieved of the attestation of mutation\nNo.1616 dated 20.05.1990, by the revenue staff, whereby the property\nowned by Mst. Ghulam Zohra with respect to two sets of land situated in\nvillage Chittan, Tehsil and District Jnelum as well as land situated in village\nSaeela, Tehsil and District Jnelum (hereinafter referred to as “the\nProperty” ), was mutated in favour of her husband and children. The factual\naspect of the controversy is that the property was owned by Kala Khan,\nwho died in 1934, leaving behind his wife, Mst. Jewani, and a daughter, Mst.\nGhulam Zohra. The property was mutated in favour of Mst. Ghulam Zohra\non the basis of Kala Khan's Will vide mutation No.2482, dated 12.05.1934\nand mutation No.838 dated 11.05.1934. After the demise of Kala Khan,\n\nMst. Jewani contracted second marriage with Muhammad Yousaf, who\n\nCA No. 184/2013 IN C.P.L.A.1297/2012\n\nwas Kala Khan’s nephew. Mst. Ghulam Zohra died in 1988, and as stated\nabove, her property was mutated in favour of her husband and son(s).\nDuring life time she alienated 09 marlas of property through a sale deed.\nShe also transferred, during her lifetime, 10 kanals and 04 marlas of\nproperty to the defendants/respondents. The appellants, being legal heirs\nof Muhamad Yousaf, asserted that since the property was left through a\nWill to Mst. Ghulam Zohra, who was a limited owner under customary law\nso after her death, half the property devolved upon Mst. Ghulam Zohra’s\nlegal heirs and the other half upon legal heirs of Mohammad Yousaf who\nwas the sole male heir at the time of Kala Knan’s demise. Appellants claim\nfound success with the trial Court and their suit was decreed vide\njudgment and decree dated 28.09.2000. Appeal was preferred by the\nrespondents, which was allowed on 22.10.2001 and the suit of the\npetitioners/appellants was dismissed. Civil Revision was preferred against\nthe decision of the Appellate Court, which was dismissed vide judgment\ndated 17.05.2012.\n\n3. Learned counsel for the appellants, inter alia, contended that\nthe Appellate Court as well as the High Court lost sight of the evidence that\nMst. Ghulam Zohra was only the limited owner and that, upon her death,\nthe property devolved upon the last surviving male of Kala Khan i.e.\nMuhammad Yousaf and the petitioners, being the legal heirs of the\nMuhammad Yousaf, are entitled to half a share in the property. It was\nfurther contended that, as a limited owner, Mst. Ghulam Zohra could not\nhave alienated the property during her lifetime and that the entire property\n\ndoes not automatically devolve upon the legal heirs of Mst. Ghulam Zohra.\n\nCA No. 184/2013 IN C.P.L.A.1297/2012\n\n4. Learned counsel for respondents No.1 to 3 submitted that the\nimpugned judgment does not suffer from any error warranting interference,\nand that the Appellate Court as well as the High Court has taken into\naccount all aspects in detail.\n\n5. Heard. The background leading to filing of the instant appeal has\nalready been mentioned hereinabove.\n\n6. The appellants, in their plaint, have mentioned pedigree-table,\nwhich does not mention Faqeer, son of Qasim and cousin of Kala Khan. No\nevidence to corroborate the pedigree table was produced before the Court.\nThere is ample case law on the subject that pedigree table alone has little\nor no probative value and has to be corroborated through independent\ncogent evidence. Faqeer was admittedly alive at the time of the death of\nKala in 1934 and the first Appellate Court discussed this issue in detail,\nholding that in the presence of Faqeer, Muhammad Yousaf could not get\nany share in the property at the time when Kala Khan died and succession\nopened. Learned counsel for the petitioners/appellants was at a loss in\nexplaining the position, showing that Faqeer was alive, the proof whereof\nby way of pedigrees table was tendered in evidence as Ex.P-16 and Ex.D-6.\nIt is also an admitted position that customary law applies only to ancestral\nproperty and not acquired land. However, the appellants did not plead that\nthe land in question was ancestral and evidence was led and documentary\nevidence was duly exhibited to show that the property was acquired by\nKala Khan during his lifetime and, under custom, a daughter could have\ntaken the property. The property was left to Mst. Ghulam Zohra through a\nWill and mutations of the Will were duly attested, however, it contained a\n\ncondition that she will be a limited owner till her death. A Muslim may\n\nCA No. 184/2013 IN C.P.L.A.1297/2012\n\nmake a gift of his property; similarly, he also has the right of testamentary\ndisposition of his property or, in other words, he may dispose of his\nproperty by making a Will, but this testamentary power is limited to the\ndisposal of only one third of property (the details of the said restriction are\nexplained infra). The leading authority, on the law of Wills in Islam, is\nHadaya, which was translated from original Arabic into Persian by four\nMuslim scholars and then into English by Charles Hamilton by the order of\nWarren Hastings, when he was the Governor General of India’. The\nbackground regarding compilation of Hadaya is provided in Mullah’s\nPrinciples of Mohammaden Law in the following words: -\n“The Hidaya was composed by Shaikh Burhan-ud-Din Ali who\nflourished in the twelfth century. The author of the Hidaya\nbelonged to the Hanafi School, and it is the doctrine of that\nschool that he has principally recorded in that word” .\nAnother authoritative work on Islamic principles, as per ‘Principles of\nMohammaden Law by Hidayatullah’, is Fatawa Alamgiri which was\ncompiled in the seventeenth century by the command of Emperor\nAurangzeb Alamgir. It is a collection of most authoritative fatwas or\nexpositions of law on all points that had been decided till the time of its\npreparation. Both the works expound law on the Hanafi sect. According to\n\nM. Santariya quoted by Ameer Ali:\n\n“Awill from Muslim point of view is a divine institution since\n\nits right is regulated by Holy Quran.....”\nThe Will under the Hanafi Muslim Law may either be verbal or in writing,\nhowever a Muslim cannot, by Will, dispose of more than 3% of surplus of his\n\nestate after payment of funeral expenses and debt. In this regard, origin of\n\n' Mullah’s Principles of Mohammaden Law by Mr. Justice Hidayatullah\n\nCA No. 184/2013 IN C.P.L.A.1297/2012\n\nthe rule is provided in Hedaya 671; Baillie 625, wherein it has been\nmentioned that Wills are declared to be lawful in the Holy Quran and the\ntraditions; but the limit of one-third is not laid down in the Holy Quran. This\nlimit derives sanction from a tradition reported by Hazrat Abee Vekass\n(RA). It is said that the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) paid a visit to Hazrat\nAbee Vekass (RA.) while the latter was ill and his life was despaired of.\nHazrat Abee Vekass (RA.) had no heirs except a daughter, and he asked\nthe Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) whether he could dispose of the whole of\nhis property by Will to which the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) replied\nsaying that he could not dispose of the whole, nor even two-thirds, nor one-\nhalf, but only one-third (Hedaya, 671). But though the limit of one-third is\nnot prescribed by the Holy Quran, there are indications in the Holy Quran\nthat a Muslim may not so dispose of his property by Will as to leave his\nheirs destitute. According to Mohammaden Law by Hidayat Ullah, the only\ncase in which a testamentary disposition is binding upon the heirs is where\nthe bequest does not exceed the legal third and it is made to a person who\nis not an heir; but a bequest in excess of the legal third may be validated by\nthe consent of the heirs. In case, the heirs do not consent, the remaining\ntwo-thirds must go to the heirs in the shares prescribed by the law. The\nconsent once given by the heirs to a legacy exceeding the legal third,\ncannot be rescinded. Similarly, a bequest with a condition which derogates\nfrom the completeness of the grant takes effect as if no condition was\nattached to it, for the condition is void. (Mohammaden Law by\nHidayatullah). However, according to Dr. Tanzil-ur-Rehman, Will may be\nmade dependant on some condition; in such an event, the condition must\n\nbe valid, otherwise the condition shall be void and the Will shall be\n\nCA No. 184/2013 IN C.P.L.A.1297/2012\n\neffective (Dr. Tanzil-ur-Rehman, A Code of Muslim Personal Law, Volume ll,\npage 196).\n\n7. In the instant case, Kala Khan by virtue of a Will, transferred the\nproperty in favour of his daughter with the condition that she takes the\nproperty as life owner. The said condition, in light of principles provided in\nIslamic Law of Inheritance, especially pertaining to ‘Will’, is void;\nresultantly, Mst. Ghulam Zohra took the property, under Will, free of the\ncondition and became the absolute owner of the same.\n\n8. Since Mst. Ghulam Zohra did become absolute owner of the\nproperty upon her death, the property was inherited by her legal heirs, i.e.\nRespondents No.2 to 5. There is another aspect of the matter, before the\nShariat Application Act, 1948 customary law was applicable in inheritance\nmatters. The 1948 Act aimed to apply Islamic law in matters of inheritance,\nbut it wasn’t fully effective. Therefore, the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat)\nApplication Act, 1962 was introduced, which established that Muslim\nPersonal Law would govern the inheritance matters. Under this law, if a\nfemale held a limited estate under customary law, that estate would\ncontinue until it was legally terminated. After termination, inheritance\nwould be based on Islamic law, opening on the date of the last male\nowner’s death. However, limitations on male heir’s powers to transfer land\ninherited under customary law persisted. To address these issues, section\n2-A was added to the 1962 Act through an amendment in 1983. The\nreferred provision provides that the male heirs who acquired agricultural\nland under the customary law from a Muslim before March 15, 1948, would\nbe considered absolute owners of that land, as if it had been inherited\n\nunder Islamic law. In a nut-shell, section 2-A clarifies that male heirs who\n\nCA No. 184/2013 IN C.P.L.A.1297/2012\n\ninherited land under customary law before 1948 are recognised as full\nowners under Islamic law, ensuring absolute rights to the entire property.\nThe transition from customary to Islamic law of inheritance in Pakistan has\nbeen a complex process, which has been highlighted in various Supreme\n\nCourt judgments. In Haider versus Murad (PLD 2012 Supreme Court 501)\n\nthis court noted that prior to the Shariat Application Act of 1948, the\ncustomary law was followed, which did not fully apply Islamic law. The\ncourt emphasized that the enactment of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat)\nApplication Act, 1962 was a significant step towards applying Islamic law in\nmatters of inheritance, particularly after the introduction of section 2-A\nthrough amending Ordinance, 1983, which aimed to ensure that male heirs\nwere recognised as full owners of inherited property under Islamic law,\nrather than under the limitations of customary law. In Mst. Farida Khatoon\n\nversus Dr. Masood Ahmed Butt (2009 SCMR 464), this court while\n\ninterpreting section 2-A ibid observed that before the enactments (1948 Act\nand then Section 2-A), life interests allowing for usufruct of a property of\ndeceased owner was prevalent under customary law in Punjab and some\nother parts of subcontinent. As a consequence of the enactments, in\nquestion, settlement of inheritance and distribution of shares according to\nshariat were enforced thereby overriding any custom or usage.\nConsequently, the creation of life interests for enjoyments of usufruct of\nproperties upon the death of a male holder were done away with and were\nsubjected to Muslim Personal Laws (Shariat). This court, in the referred\ncase, discussed the case law on the subject and distinguished the\ntransactions which did not fell within the scope of section 2-A, ibid. In view\n\nof above position of the law by virtue of section 2 (A) of the West\n\nCA No. 184/2013 IN C.P.L.A.1297/2012\n\nPakistan Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Act, 1962, limited estates have\nbeen done away with retrospective application of the said provision, hence\nMst. Ghulam Zohra became the absolute owner of the property in question.\n9. In view of the above position of law and facts, we feel that the\nimpugned judgment does take care of all aspects of the matter and does\nnot suffer from any error of law or jurisdiction, resulting in miscarriage of\njustice, or warranting our interference.\n\n10. In view of above, the instant appeal is without merit and is\n\naccordingly dismissed.\n\nJudge\nJudge\nJudge\nIslamabad\n20.02.2025\n\nApproved for Reporting\n\nZawar", "CleanedText": "JUDGMENT AAMER FAROOQ, J.- This appeal arises out of leave granted by this Court, vide order dated 21.01.2013, in Civil Petition No.1297/2012. 2.

The present bunch of Civil Appeals arises\n\nout of Reference Jurisdiction of the High Court under the Customs Act, 1969\n(hereinafter referred to as the ‘Act’) whereunder a number of questions\n(mentioned below) have been decided substantially by two judgments of\nSindh High Court. The commonality in all references, in terms of questions\nwere:\n\n(1) Whether a motor vehicle, duly registered with the Excise &\nTaxation Department under the Motor Vehicle Registration\nOrdinance, 1965, can be detained/seized by the Customs\nAuthorities on the charges of smuggling in terms of Section\n2(s) read with Section 156(1)(89) and (90) of the Customs Act,\n1969, if the owner is not in possession of the import\ndocuments?\n\n(2) Whether the Customs Authorities can ask for production\nof record, including import documents from owner in respect\nof a Motor Vehicle or any other importable item, beyond the\nperiod of five years in terms of Section 211 of the Customs Act,\n1969?\n\n(3) Whether the Registration Book, Customs Auction\nDocuments, Form of Transfer Order, Bank challans towards\npayments of additional duty and taxes, capital value tax (CVT),\nregistration fee, transfer fee and other charges, unless proved\nto be bogus and forged, constitute other documents\nprescribed by or under any law for the time being in force in\nterms of Section 187 of the Customs Act, 1969?\n\n(4) Whether production of documents as prescribed by or\nunder any law for the time being in force by the owner in\nrespect of a motor vehicle or any other importable item shifts\nthe burden of proof from the owner, upon the Customs\n\nCivil Appeal No. 1088 of 2013 etc. 4\n\nAuthorities to establish the charge of smuggling through\npositive evidence or any concrete: material to the contrary, in\nterms of Section 2(s) read with Section 156(1)(89) and (90) of\nthe Customs Act, 1969?\n\n5. Whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, the\nlearned Tribunal has materially erred in its reading of the\nevidence, and has misread the same inasmuch as it has failed\nto draw the correct legal conclusion that necessarily follows\nfrom the fact that the vehicle was disposed off by the Punjab\nauthorities by way of an auction and acquired on such basis?\n2. For the purposes of present controversy (summarized in references),\nwe should keep in mind that the Reference jurisdiction is contoured to\n\ndecide the questions of law only arising out of the orders of the last appellate\n\njurisdiction i.e. Tribunal, which is the last fact finding forum.\n\n3. For the sake of brevity Civil Appeal No. 1235/2013 is being treated as\nleading appeal to answer the questions raised in leave granting order, in\nwhich the main judgment dated 15.02.2013 of the High Court of Sindh is\nimpugned/challenged whereby Special Customs Reference Applications\n\nNo.263/2010 and 245 and 253 of 2008 were decided.\n\n4. Leaves were granted on 25.09.2013 in some of these Civil Appeals\nwhich were filed in the year 2013 and the three questions/points, which\nwere framed were also adopted in the subsequent appeals and are as under:\n\ni) The vehicles which are imported through any route\nother than those declared under Sections 9 or 10 of the Act\nwould be treated as smuggled goods within the meaning of\nSection 2(s) of the Act;\n\nii) The court had erred in shifting the burden of proof to\nthe authorities whereas under Section 187 as well as under\nclauses 8 and 89 of Section 156(1) of the Act the burden is on\nthe person who owns or possesses the goods to establish that\nhe had lawful authority or a lawful excuse to possess the\nsame;\n\niii) None of the vehicles that were the subject matter of the\nreferences before the High Court were lawfully imported into\nthe country.\n\nCivil Appeal No. 1088 of 2013 etc. 5\n\n5. We, on the above questions, have heard learned counsel for the parties\nand perused material available on record. We have also been valuably\nassisted by Mr. Sirdar Ahmed Jamal Sukhera Advocate, who was appointed\n\nas Amicus Curiae earlier.\n\n6. The substantive questions for us as undertaken was/is whether the\nvehicles, considered by the customs department to have been smuggled,\nwere rightly seized and confiscated, notwithstanding that admittedly they\nwere either bought in “auction conducted by the government” or purchased\nfrom the respective owners who had shown the “verified registration books”\nand that the statutory period, to enquire/demand import documents on the\nbasis of which the registration of some of the vehicles took place, as framed\nin Section 211 of Custom Act, had lapsed whereas others were registered\n\non the basis of auction reports.\n\n7. The cause to seize and confiscate the vehicles triggered when show-\ncause notices were issued to the individuals having custody of the subject\nvehicles. It is a common stance of the appellants/department that these\nvehicles were either smuggled one and/or were shown to have been acquired\non fake auction report followed by disputed registration, whereas some of\nthem having chassis number re-punched to match auctioned vehicles’\nstatistics. The ancillary common stance of the appellant/department was\nthat the respondents have failed to produce the import documents as\nagainst the registration of the vehicles. Each of the show-cause notices were\nthen taken to its logical end under customs hierarchy i.e. after Order-in-\nOriginal, Order-in-Appeal and order of Appellate Tribunal, the issue finally\ncame before the High Court in Special Customs Reference Applications\n\n(reference jurisdiction) wherein the questions were finally answered in\n\nCivil Appeal No. 1088 of 2013 etc.\n\nfavour of the respondents and against the appellants/department in terms\n\nwhereof the vehicles were released to the respondents, hence these appeals.\n\n8. There are 23 Civil Appeals, the subject matter of which is the seizure\n\nof the vehicles and the allegations are common as described above. To cut\n\nshort the controversy, these petitions are categorized in the following\n\nmanner with their respective data:\n\nSs. C.A. SCRA/CP | Regst.

A perusal of Section 2(s) and 156(8), (89) and (90) of the Act reflects\n\nthat clause 8 deals with smuggling whereas clause 89 deals with smuggled\n\ngoods and clause 90 with goods other than to which clause 89 relates. For\n\nthe sake of brevity these sections/clauses are reproduced as under:\n“Section 2.-\n\n(s) “smuggle” means to bring into or take out of Pakistan, in breach\nof any prohibition or restriction for the time being in force, or\nevading payment of customs-duties or taxes leviable thereon,-\n\n(i) gold bullion, silver bullion, platinum, palladium, radium,\nprecious stones, antiques, currency, narcotics and narcotic and\npsychotropic substances; or\n\n(ii) manufactures of gold or silver or platinum or palladium or\nradium or precious stones, and any other goods notified by the\nFederal Government in the official Gazette, which, in each case,\nexceed one hundred and fifty thousand rupees in value; or\n\n(iii) any goods by any route other than a route declared under\nsection 9 or 10 or from any place other than a customs-station and\nincludes an attempt, abetment or connivance of so bringing in or\ntaking out of such goods; and all cognate words and expressions\nshall be construed accordingly;\n\n(i) essential commodities, as notified by the Board.”\n\n156. Punishment for offences.- (1) Whoever commits any offence\ndescribed in column 1 of the Table below shall, in addition to and\nnot in derogation of any punishment to which he may be liable\nunder any other law, be liable to the punishment mentioned\nagainst that offence in column 2 thereof:-\n\n8.| (i) Where any goods| Such goods shall be | General\nincluding essential | liable to confiscation\ncommodities as notified | and any person\nby the Board’ be|concerned in _ the\nsmuggled into or out of | offence shall be liable\nPakistan to ......\n\n\nCivil Appeal No. 1088 of 2013 ete.\n\n89.\n\n(i) If any person without\nlawful excuse, the proof\nof which shall be on\nsuch person, acquires\npossession of, or is in\nany way concerned in\ncarrying, removing,\ndepositing, harbouring,\nkeeping or concealing,\nretailing or in any\nmanner dealing with\nsmuggled goods or any\ngoods in respect to\nwhich there may be\nreasonable suspicion\nthat they are smuggled\ngoods;\n\nProvided....\n\nsuch goods shall be\nliable to confiscation\nand any person\nconcerned in the\noffence shall be liable\nto a_ penalty not\nexceeding ten times\nthe value of the goods;\nand, where the value\nof such goods exceeds\nthree hundred\nthousand rupees, he\nshall further be liable,\nupon conviction by a\nSpecial Judge, to\nimprisonment for a\nterm not exceeding six\nyears and to a fine not\nexceeding ten times\nbut not less than the\nvalue of such goods\n\nGeneral\n\n(i) If any person, without\nlawful excuse the proof\nof which shall be on\nsuch person, acquires\npossession of, or is in\nany way concerned in\ncarrying, removing,\ndepositing, harbouring,\nkeeping or concealing or\nin any manner dealing\nwith any goods, not\nbeing goods referred to\nin clause 89, which\nhave been unlawfully\nremoved from a\nwarehouse, or which\nare chargeable with a\nduty which has not been\npaid, or with respect to\nthe importation or\nexportation of which\nthere is a reasonable\nsuspicion that any\nprohibition or restriction\nfor the time being in\nforce under or by virtue\nof this Act has been\ncontravened, or if any\nperson is in relation to\nany such goods in any\nway, without lawful\nexcuse, the proof of\nwhich shall be on such\nperson, concerned in\n\nsuch goods shall be\nliable to confiscation,\nand any person\nconcerned shall also\nbe liable to a penalty\nnot exceeding ten\ntimes the value of the\ngoods.\n\nGeneral\n\n\nCivil Appeal No. 1088 of 2013 ete.\n\n10\n\nany fraudulent evasion\nor attempt at evasion of\nany duty chargeable\nthereon, or of any such\nprohibition or restriction\nas aforesaid or of any\nprovision of this Act\napplicable to those\ngoods,\n\n(ii) in case seized goods\nliable to confiscation not\nbeing goods referred to\nin clause 89, placed in\nthe custody of the owner\nof the goods or any\nperson holding the\ngoods in his possession\nor charge are found\n\nsuch goods shall be\nliable to confiscation\nand any person\nconcerned in _ the\noffence shall be liable\nto a_ penalty not\nexceeding two times of\nthe value of such\ngoods and upon\nconviction by a Special\nJudge, shall further be\nliable to imprisonment\nfor a_ term not\nexceeding six months\nor to a _ fine not\nexceeding fifty\nthousand rupees or\nboth.\n\nremoved illegally,\nexchanged, pilfered or\ndisposed of in any\nmanner,\n\n10. For clause 89 to apply, the condition precedent is that the goods in\nquestion should be smuggled one. In terms of Section 2(s) read with the\napplicable notification thereunder it seems that vehicles can be considered\nsmuggled if either (i) at the relevant time, the applicable notification in terms\nof Section 2(s)(ii) included vehicles, or (ii) in terms of Section 2(s)(iii) the\nvehicles were brought in by any route other than a route declared under\n\nSection 9 or Section 10 or from any place other than the customs station.\n\n11. Motor vehicles were not originally listed in SRO 491(1)/85 dated\n23.5.1985 but were added thereto only on 14.09.1998 by means of an\namending notification. Keeping this in mind, any vehicle brought into\nPakistan before 14.09.1998 could only be considered a smuggled vehicle if\nit is established that it was brought into Pakistan through a route other than\nthe routes permissible under Section 2(s)(iii). There cannot be a simple\nanswer that since original import documents were neither available with\ncustoms nor with the one having custody of the vehicle or motor registration\n\nauthority, therefore, it is the smuggled one as the application of Section 211\n\nCivil Appeal No. 1088 of 2013 etc. 11\n\nof the Act has its own effects. For ease of understanding we give references\nof some vehicles. In SCRA No. 263 of 2010, the model year of the vehicle was\n1986 and it was seized in 2008; in SCRA No. 245 of 2008, the model year of\nthe vehicle was 1991 and it was seized in 2006, in SCRA No. 253 of 2008\nthe model year of the vehicle was 1991 and it was seized in 2005. These are\nsubject matters of Civil Appeal No.1235 of 2013. All the vehicles have been\nregistered with Motor Registration Authority (MRA) as shown in the chart\nabove. Indeed, neither model year nor its registration could give exact date\nof arrival of vehicles to Pakistan however the effect of Section 211 is\nimperative as the burden is heavier on appellants to demonstrate above\n\nfacts.\n\n12. For the amended SRO’s effect, (wherein vehicles were included), the\nrecord of import is required to be kept in terms of Section 211(2) for a period\nof five years (\"five\" was substituted for the word \"three\" by the Finance Act,\n2007). For the sake of brevity, such provisions of law is reproduced as under:\n\n“211. Maintenance of record. All importers, exporters and\nclaimants of duty drawback, refunds or any notified concessions,\nterminal operators, owners of the warehouses, customs agents\nand the licensed customs bonded carriers, transport operators\nand tracking companies, carrying out business under this Act or\nrules made thereunder or under any other law, directly or\nindirectly, relating to international trade, shall be required to\nmaintain and keep records and correspondence concerning\nimport, export and transit trade transactions.\n\n(2) The records required under sub-section (1) shall be kept for a\nperiod not less than five years in such form as the Board may by\nnotification in the official gazette, specify.\n\n(3) The provision of sub-section (1) shall not be applicable to the\n\nbaggage of the passengers and crew of the conveyance and to the\nrecipients of gifts.”\n\n13. The consequence of this provision appears to be that if the auction of\nthe vehicle took place more than 3 years ago for cases prior to the Finance\n\nAct, 2007 and 5 years for cases thereafter, there would appear to be a \"lawful\n\nCivil Appeal No. 1088 of 2013 etc. 12\n\nexcuse\" to the person (retaining the possession of vehicle under valid\nregistration), who is accused of an offence under Section 156(89) or (90) (for\nnot showing required import documents), unless it can be demonstrated\nthat he was told or knew that duties and taxes were not paid and the same\n\nwere required to be paid.\n\n14. For auctioned vehicles such as in SCRA No. 263 of 2010 (Civil Appeal\nNo.1235 of 2013), the vehicle in question was auctioned on or about\n25.11.1999, having registration No.BD-0689 dated 24.06.2005 and was\nintercepted on or about 09.10.2008. In these circumstances, Section 211(2)\nseems to provide a \"lawful excuse\" since no adverse inference for failure to\nproduce the documents can be drawn after the lapse of period provided in\nSection 211(2) to be counted at-least from date of registration if not before,\nas auction date in other vehicles is also a legitimate claim to count time. The\nvehicle in question was in Pakistan on or about 25.11.1999, i.e. the date of\nauction, and the said period expired before the vehicle was intercepted on\nor about 09.10.2008. There does not appear to be anything on the record to\nsuggest that as per the terms of the auction, the auction purchaser had to\npay duties and taxes applicable in respect of the import of the auctioned\nvehicle. Similarly, in all other cases where (not auctioned cases) the\nregistration record with Motor Registration Authority and registration books\n(duly verified) are available, the subject period of 3/5 years would apply to\ngive beneficial effect of Section 211 to those having custody and registration\n\nin their names.\n\n15. The provisions of Section 174 of Income Tax Ordinance 2001, for\npresent controversy is pari materia to Section 211 of the Act. The provisions\n\nof 174 of the Ordinance was discussed at length in Panther Sports! specially\n\n1 Commissioner Inland Revenue v. Panther Sports (2022 SCMR 1135)\n\nCivil Appeal No. 1088 of 2013 etc. 13\n\nin para-5. Since the two provisions are pari materia therefor by applying\ndoctrine of statutory construction there cannot be a different interpretation\nof section 211 of Act than the one given in the said judgment for section 174\n\nof the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001.\n\n16. So in cases of registered vehicles, if at the time the vehicle being\nintercepted, more than 3 years have elapsed for cases prior to the Finance\nAct, 2007 and 5 years for cases thereafter, the defence of \"lawful excuse\"\nappears to be indefeasible. This is also because it is reasonable to assume\nthat if a vehicle stands registered, the government is presumed to have\nexercised due care and diligence with respect to its obligation to see\nwhatever duties and taxes as payable to the government before a vehicle can\nbe registered, stand paid. It must also be noted that the vehicles being\nregistered, which registration was duly verified, is presumed to have been\nbrought lawfully; after completion of notified period in case of used vehicles\nalso. It seems harsh, to say the least, if without any proof that a person (last\nowner) was involved in the registration of the vehicle knowing fully well that\nno duties and taxes, as required under the law, were paid, and that therefore\nthe vehicle was fraudulently registered, the vehicle be seized from him on\nhis failure to produce documents of import and payment of duties and taxes\nthereon and even that beyond the period of three years or five years, as the\ncase may be, as required under section 211(2). In most of the cases since\nfirst registration, the vehicles changed many owners on the strength of\nregistration book and no adverse inference could be drawn for the ultimate\nbonafide owners unless otherwise proved contrary by appellant, in which\nexercise the appellant department has failed below. The verified registration\nbook and official record is enough for bonafide presumption that a valid title\n\nexist.\n\nCivil Appeal No. 1088 of 2013 ete. 14\n\n17. The Motor Vehicle Ordinance, 1965 provides the mechanism for\nregistration of motor vehicles in terms of its sections from 23 to 43. Section\n27 of ibid law even provides the production of the vehicle at the time of\nregistration and if the registration of a vehicle passes through this statutory\n\nprocess conducted by officials responsible under M.V.O 1965, then\n\npresumption of truthfulness is eminent.\n\n18. One must bear in mind that there is a distinction between the\nexpression \"lawful authority\" contained in Section 187 and the expression\n\n\"lawful excuse\" contained in clause 89 of Section 156 (1). The distinction in\n\nboth is reproduced as under:\n\nSection 187 Clause 89 of Section 156(1)\n\n187. Burden of proof as to lawful\nauthority etc.- When any person is\nalleged to have committed an offence\nunder this Act and any question\narises whether he did any act or was\nin possession of anything with\nlawful authority or under a permit,\nlicense or other document prescribed\nby or under any law for the time\nbeing in force, the burden of proving\nthat he had such authority, permit,\nlicense or other document shall lie on\nhim:\n\nProvided that any person, alleged to\nhave committed an offence under\nthis Act, shall bear the burden of\nproof that any property owned by\nhim in his name or someone else\nname was not acquired from the\nproceeds of such crime:\n\nProvided further that the procedure\nfor forfeiture of such property shall\nbe prescribed by the Board under the\nrules.\n\nIf any person without lawful excuse,\nthe proof of which shall be on such\nperson, acquires possession of, or is\nin any way concerned in carrying,\nremoving, depositing, harbouring,\nkeeping or concealing, retailing or in\nany manner dealing with smuggled\ngoods or any goods in respect to\nwhich there may be_ reasonable\nsuspicion that they are smuggled\ngoods\n\n19. To apply Section 187 to clauses (89) and (90) of Section 156 would\namount to limit or narrow down the scope of what is permissible under the\n\nsaid clauses of Section 156 of the Act as a defence; and that cannot be done.\n\nCivil Appeal No. 1088 of 2013 etc. 15\n\nThe legislature was conscious while using the two legal phrases which have\ndifferent connotation. Section 187 in general deals with burden of proof as\nto lawful authority whereas Section 156 deals with punishment for offence.\nIn this context, Section 187 can be regarded as a general provision whereas\nclauses (89) and (90) are specific provisions and in such a situation the\nspecific provisions (to the context) must apply to the event/situation under\ndiscussion. As such, the accused persons are entitled only to demonstrate\na lawful excuse to discharge themselves from the allegation under the said\nclauses even where the law is conceived to have been violated in respect of\nthe goods i.e. the goods are smuggled goods in absence of import documents,\nand that is possible courtesy statutory period, (disclosed in Section 211)\nfollowed by registration book through an official act under the law. A strong\npresumption is thus attached as a statutory act was performed in the\n\nregistration of vehicle.\n\n20. The distinction between lawful authority and lawful excuse was\nhighlighted by the Privy Council in the judgment reported as PLD 1955 PC\n29 by holding that the defence of lawful excuse may be sufficiently proved\nalthough no lawful authority exists for doing what is charged against the\naccused. Lawful excuse is an expression that is of wider import and lesser\ndegree of burden than lawful authority. It follows from this that proving a\nlawful excuse, which falls short of lawful authority, it is the excuse put\nforward by the accused, rather than handling smuggled goods, that must be\n\nshown to be lawful.\n\n21. Conceiving the events discussed in show-cause notices with above\nanalysis as a common tool, it demonstrates that the vehicles in question are\nactually those which were registered through a statutory process and were\n\nduly verified and hence would carry lawful excuse.\n\nCivil Appeal No. 1088 of 2013 etc. 16\n\n22. This principle however is distinguished for the case where vehicles\nwere found with tampered chassis and engine numbers. If this is seemingly\ndone to match the statistics of original vehicles auctioned or brought into\nPakistan officially having different chassis/engine number, the lawful\nexcuse may not be applicable in case of tampered vehicle. This would not\ninclude those vehicles which were acquired via auction report explicitly\ndisclosing such tampering and tampered statistics. Also at times the engine\nand chassis numbers are changed which are also excluded from any action,\nprovided it was done with prior permission of the authority under the Motor\nVehicles Ordinance, 1965. All this require thorough probe at the end to\napplicant which again is a question of fact not required to be determined by\n\nus afresh.\n\n23. Learned counsel for the responded/department has mainly\nemphasized that a proper procedure was adopted while initiating\nconfiscation and/or seizure process. Suffice to say that applying right\nprocedure on wrong person and at the wrong time would not serve any\npurpose, rather is an abuse of process of law and such actions would be of\nno help for the department to take corrective measure to curb the smuggling.\nSuch actions ought to have been taken at the time when vehicles were being\nregistered. The appellants should workout some collaborated efforts before\nand at the time of registration of such vehicles so that this menace may\n\ncome to an end. A proper joint effort in registration may be a way out.\n\n24. Indeed, the respondents in order to achieve their lawful object of\nidentifying the vehicles and subjected them to such exercise, the concerned\ndirectorate, on receipt of credible information of a suspected vehicle from\nauthority concerned, including but not limited to Motor Registration\n\nAuthority, may take requisite steps. In conducting such exercise a lady\n\nCivil Appeal No. 1088 of 2013 etc. 17\n\ncustom officer and a lady sepoy should also be aligned to ensure privacy and\nrespect; legal requirement including search under section 162 of the Act be\n\nfollowed and inconvenience to the family must be avoided.\n\n25. The conclusion in the above analysis is that the vehicles in question\nare those which were either auctioned or were brought into Pakistan and\nwere registered through a statutory process and that the auction papers or\nregistration papers of some other vehicles are not being used fraudulently,\nhowever, where it is established that the chassis/engine numbers have been\ntampered with after auction or registration to match the description of the\n\nauctioned or registered vehicle, the lawful excuse is not available.\n\n26. With this understanding the questions have been answered\ncumulatively and no case for interference is made out and appeals are\n\ndismissed.\n\nChief Justice\n\nJudge\n\nJudge\n\nAnnounced in open Court on 17 April, 2025 at Islamabad.\n\nJudge\n\n[**] Approved for Reporting", "CleanedText": "JUDGMENT Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui, J. The present bunch of Civil Appeals arises out of Reference Jurisdiction of the High Court under the Customs Act, 1969 hereinafter referred to as the Act whereunder a number of questions mentioned below have been decided substantially by two judgments of Sindh High Court. The commonality in all references, in terms of questions were: 1 Whether a motor vehicle, duly registered with the Excise Taxation Department under the Motor Vehicle Registration Ordinance, 1965, can be detained/seized by the Customs Authorities on the charges of smuggling in terms of Section 2 s read with Section 156 1 89 and 90 of the Customs Act, 1969, if the owner is not in possession of the import documents? 2 Whether the Customs Authorities can ask for production of record, including import documents from owner in respect of a Motor Vehicle or any other importable item, beyond the period of five years in terms of Section 211 of the Customs Act, 1969? 3 Whether the Registration Book, Customs Auction Documents, Form of Transfer Order, Bank challans towards payments of additional duty and taxes, capital value tax CVT , registration fee, transfer fee and other charges, unless proved to be bogus and forged, constitute other documents prescribed by or under any law for the time being in force in terms of Section 187 of the Customs Act, 1969? 4 Whether production of documents as prescribed by or under any law for the time being in force by the owner in respect of a motor vehicle or any other importable item shifts the burden of proof from the owner, upon the Customs Civil Appeal No. 1088 of 2013 etc. 4 Authorities to establish the charge of smuggling through positive evidence or any concrete: material to the contrary, in terms of Section 2 s read with Section 156 1 89 and 90 of the Customs Act, 1969? 5. Whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned Tribunal has materially erred in its reading of the evidence, and has misread the same inasmuch as it has failed to draw the correct legal conclusion that necessarily follows from the fact that the vehicle was disposed off by the Punjab authorities by way of an auction and acquired on such basis? 2. For the purposes of present controversy summarized in references , we should keep in mind that the Reference jurisdiction is contoured to decide the questions of law only arising out of the orders of the last appellate jurisdiction i.e. Tribunal, which is the last fact finding forum. 3. For the sake of brevity Civil Appeal No. 1235/2013 is being treated as leading appeal to answer the questions raised in leave granting order, in which the main judgment dated 15.02.2013 of the High Court of Sindh is impugned/challenged whereby Special Customs Reference Applications No.263/2010 and 245 and 253 of 2008 were decided. 4. Leaves were granted on 25.09.2013 in some of these Civil Appeals which were filed in the year 2013 and the three questions/points, which were framed were also adopted in the subsequent appeals and are as under: i The vehicles which are imported through any route other than those declared under Sections 9 or 10 of the Act would be treated as smuggled goods within the meaning of Section 2 s of the Act; ii The court had erred in shifting the burden of proof to the authorities whereas under Section 187 as well as under clauses 8 and 89 of Section 156 1 of the Act the burden is on the person who owns or possesses the goods to establish that he had lawful authority or a lawful excuse to possess the same; iii None of the vehicles that were the subject matter of the references before the High Court were lawfully imported into the country. Civil Appeal No. 1088 of 2013 etc. 5 5. We, on the above questions, have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused material available on record. We have also been valuably assisted by Mr. Sirdar Ahmed Jamal Sukhera Advocate, who was appointed as Amicus Curiae earlier. 6. The substantive questions for us as undertaken was/is whether the vehicles, considered by the customs department to have been smuggled, were rightly seized and confiscated, notwithstanding that admittedly they were either bought in auction conducted by the government or purchased from the respective owners who had shown the verified registration books and that the statutory period, to enquire/demand import documents on the basis of which the registration of some of the vehicles took place, as framed in Section 211 of Custom Act, had lapsed whereas others were registered on the basis of auction reports. 7. The cause to seize and confiscate the vehicles triggered when showcause notices were issued to the individuals having custody of the subject vehicles. It is a common stance of the appellants/department that these vehicles were either smuggled one and/or were shown to have been acquired on fake auction report followed by disputed registration, whereas some of them having chassis number re-punched to match auctioned vehicles statistics. The ancillary common stance of the appellant/department was that the respondents have failed to produce the import documents as against the registration of the vehicles. Each of the show-cause notices were then taken to its logical end under customs hierarchy i.e. after Order-inOriginal, Order-in-Appeal and order of Appellate Tribunal, the issue finally came before the High Court in Special Customs Reference Applications reference jurisdiction wherein the questions were finally answered in Civil Appeal No. 1088 of 2013 etc. favour of the respondents and against the appellants/department in terms whereof the vehicles were released to the respondents, hence these appeals. 8. There are 23 Civil Appeals, the subject matter of which is the seizure of the vehicles and the allegations are common as described above.

A perusal of Section 2 s and 156 8 , 89 and 90 of the Act reflects that clause 8 deals with smuggling whereas clause 89 deals with smuggled goods and clause 90 with goods other than to which clause 89 relates. For the sake of brevity these sections/clauses are reproduced as under: Section 2.- s smuggle means to bring into or take out of Pakistan, in breach of any prohibition or restriction for the time being in force, or evading payment of customs-duties or taxes leviable thereon,- i gold bullion, silver bullion, platinum, palladium, radium, precious stones, antiques, currency, narcotics and narcotic and psychotropic substances; or ii manufactures of gold or silver or platinum or palladium or radium or precious stones, and any other goods notified by the Federal Government in the official Gazette, which, in each case, exceed one hundred and fifty thousand rupees in value; or iii any goods by any route other than a route declared under section 9 or 10 or from any place other than a customs-station and includes an attempt, abetment or connivance of so bringing in or taking out of such goods; and all cognate words and expressions shall be construed accordingly; i essential commodities, as notified by the Board. 156. Punishment for offences.- 1 Whoever commits any offence described in column 1 of the Table below shall, in addition to and not in derogation of any punishment to which he may be liable under any other law, be liable to the punishment mentioned against that offence in column 2 thereof:- 8. i Where any goods Such goods shall be General including essential liable to confiscation commodities as notified and any person by the Board be concerned in the smuggled into or out of offence shall be liable Pakistan to ...... Civil Appeal No. 1088 of 2013 ete. 89. i If any person without lawful excuse, the proof of which shall be on such person, acquires possession of, or is in any way concerned in carrying, removing, depositing, harbouring, keeping or concealing, retailing or in any manner dealing with smuggled goods or any goods in respect to which there may be reasonable suspicion that they are smuggled goods; Provided.... such goods shall be liable to confiscation and any person concerned in the offence shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding ten times the value of the goods; and, where the value of such goods exceeds three hundred thousand rupees, he shall further be liable, upon conviction by a Special Judge, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six years and to a fine not exceeding ten times but not less than the value of such goods General i If any person, without lawful excuse the proof of which shall be on such person, acquires possession of, or is in any way concerned in carrying, removing, depositing, harbouring, keeping or concealing or in any manner dealing with any goods, not being goods referred to in clause 89, which have been unlawfully removed from a warehouse, or which are chargeable with a duty which has not been paid, or with respect to the importation or exportation of which there is a reasonable suspicion that any prohibition or restriction for the time being in force under or by virtue of this Act has been contravened, or if any person is in relation to any such goods in any way, without lawful excuse, the proof of which shall be on such person, concerned in such goods shall be liable to confiscation, and any person concerned shall also be liable to a penalty not exceeding ten times the value of the goods. General Civil Appeal No. 1088 of 2013 ete. 10 any fraudulent evasion or attempt at evasion of any duty chargeable thereon, or of any such prohibition or restriction as aforesaid or of any provision of this Act applicable to those goods, ii in case seized goods liable to confiscation not being goods referred to in clause 89, placed in the custody of the owner of the goods or any person holding the goods in his possession or charge are found such goods shall be liable to confiscation and any person concerned in the offence shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding two times of the value of such goods and upon conviction by a Special Judge, shall further be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to a fine not exceeding fifty thousand rupees or both. removed illegally, exchanged, pilfered or disposed of in any manner, 10. For clause 89 to apply, the condition precedent is that the goods in question should be smuggled one. In terms of Section 2 s read with the applicable notification thereunder it seems that vehicles can be considered smuggled if either i at the relevant time, the applicable notification in terms of Section 2 s ii included vehicles, or ii in terms of Section 2 s iii the vehicles were brought in by any route other than a route declared under Section 9 or Section 10 or from any place other than the customs station. 11. Motor vehicles were not originally listed in SRO 491 1 /85 dated 23.5.1985 but were added thereto only on 14.09.1998 by means of an amending notification. Keeping this in mind, any vehicle brought into Pakistan before 14.09.1998 could only be considered a smuggled vehicle if it is established that it was brought into Pakistan through a route other than the routes permissible under Section 2 s iii . There cannot be a simple answer that since original import documents were neither available with customs nor with the one having custody of the vehicle or motor registration authority, therefore, it is the smuggled one as the application of Section 211 Civil Appeal No. 1088 of 2013 etc. 11 of the Act has its own effects. For ease of understanding we give references of some vehicles. In SCRA No. 263 of 2010, the model year of the vehicle was 1986 and it was seized in 2008; in SCRA No. 245 of 2008, the model year of the vehicle was 1991 and it was seized in 2006, in SCRA No. 253 of 2008 the model year of the vehicle was 1991 and it was seized in 2005. These are subject matters of Civil Appeal No.1235 of 2013. All the vehicles have been registered with Motor Registration Authority MRA as shown in the chart above. Indeed, neither model year nor its registration could give exact date of arrival of vehicles to Pakistan however the effect of Section 211 is imperative as the burden is heavier on appellants to demonstrate above facts. 12. For the amended SRO s effect, wherein vehicles were included , the record of import is required to be kept in terms of Section 211 2 for a period of five years five was substituted for the word three by the Finance Act, 2007 . For the sake of brevity, such provisions of law is reproduced as under: 211. Maintenance of record. All importers, exporters and claimants of duty drawback, refunds or any notified concessions, terminal operators, owners of the warehouses, customs agents and the licensed customs bonded carriers, transport operators and tracking companies, carrying out business under this Act or rules made thereunder or under any other law, directly or indirectly, relating to international trade, shall be required to maintain and keep records and correspondence concerning import, export and transit trade transactions. 2 The records required under sub-section 1 shall be kept for a period not less than five years in such form as the Board may by notification in the official gazette, specify. 3 The provision of sub-section 1 shall not be applicable to the baggage of the passengers and crew of the conveyance and to the recipients of gifts. 13. The consequence of this provision appears to be that if the auction of the vehicle took place more than 3 years ago for cases prior to the Finance Act, 2007 and 5 years for cases thereafter, there would appear to be a lawful Civil Appeal No. 1088 of 2013 etc. 12 excuse to the person retaining the possession of vehicle under valid registration , who is accused of an offence under Section 156 89 or 90 for not showing required import documents , unless it can be demonstrated that he was told or knew that duties and taxes were not paid and the same were required to be paid. 14. For auctioned vehicles such as in SCRA No. 263 of 2010 Civil Appeal No.1235 of 2013 , the vehicle in question was auctioned on or about 25.11.1999, having registration No.BD-0689 dated 24.06.2005 and was intercepted on or about 09.10.2008. In these circumstances, Section 211 2 seems to provide a lawful excuse since no adverse inference for failure to produce the documents can be drawn after the lapse of period provided in Section 211 2 to be counted at-least from date of registration if not before, as auction date in other vehicles is also a legitimate claim to count time. The vehicle in question was in Pakistan on or about 25.11.1999, i.e. the date of auction, and the said period expired before the vehicle was intercepted on or about 09.10.2008. There does not appear to be anything on the record to suggest that as per the terms of the auction, the auction purchaser had to pay duties and taxes applicable in respect of the import of the auctioned vehicle. Similarly, in all other cases where not auctioned cases the registration record with Motor Registration Authority and registration books duly verified are available, the subject period of 3/5 years would apply to give beneficial effect of Section 211 to those having custody and registration in their names. 15. The provisions of Section 174 of Income Tax Ordinance 2001, for present controversy is pari materia to Section 211 of the Act. The provisions of 174 of the Ordinance was discussed at length in Panther Sports! specially 1 Commissioner Inland Revenue v. Panther Sports 2022 SCMR 1135 Civil Appeal No. 1088 of 2013 etc. 13 in para-5. Since the two provisions are pari materia therefor by applying doctrine of statutory construction there cannot be a different interpretation of section 211 of Act than the one given in the said judgment for section 174 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001. 16. So in cases of registered vehicles, if at the time the vehicle being intercepted, more than 3 years have elapsed for cases prior to the Finance Act, 2007 and 5 years for cases thereafter, the defence of lawful excuse appears to be indefeasible. This is also because it is reasonable to assume that if a vehicle stands registered, the government is presumed to have exercised due care and diligence with respect to its obligation to see whatever duties and taxes as payable to the government before a vehicle can be registered, stand paid. It must also be noted that the vehicles being registered, which registration was duly verified, is presumed to have been brought lawfully; after completion of notified period in case of used vehicles also. It seems harsh, to say the least, if without any proof that a person last owner was involved in the registration of the vehicle knowing fully well that no duties and taxes, as required under the law, were paid, and that therefore the vehicle was fraudulently registered, the vehicle be seized from him on his failure to produce documents of import and payment of duties and taxes thereon and even that beyond the period of three years or five years, as the case may be, as required under section 211 2 . In most of the cases since first registration, the vehicles changed many owners on the strength of registration book and no adverse inference could be drawn for the ultimate bonafide owners unless otherwise proved contrary by appellant, in which exercise the appellant department has failed below. The verified registration book and official record is enough for bonafide presumption that a valid title exist. Civil Appeal No. 1088 of 2013 ete. 14 17. The Motor Vehicle Ordinance, 1965 provides the mechanism for registration of motor vehicles in terms of its sections from 23 to 43. Section 27 of ibid law even provides the production of the vehicle at the time of registration and if the registration of a vehicle passes through this statutory process conducted by officials responsible under M.V.O 1965, then presumption of truthfulness is eminent. 18. One must bear in mind that there is a distinction between the expression lawful authority contained in Section 187 and the expression lawful excuse contained in clause 89 of Section 156 1 . The distinction in both is reproduced as under: Section 187 Clause 89 of Section 156 1 187. Burden of proof as to lawful authority etc.- When any person is alleged to have committed an offence under this Act and any question arises whether he did any act or was in possession of anything with lawful authority or under a permit, license or other document prescribed by or under any law for the time being in force, the burden of proving that he had such authority, permit, license or other document shall lie on him: Provided that any person, alleged to have committed an offence under this Act, shall bear the burden of proof that any property owned by him in his name or someone else name was not acquired from the proceeds of such crime: Provided further that the procedure for forfeiture of such property shall be prescribed by the Board under the rules. If any person without lawful excuse, the proof of which shall be on such person, acquires possession of, or is in any way concerned in carrying, removing, depositing, harbouring, keeping or concealing, retailing or in any manner dealing with smuggled goods or any goods in respect to which there may be reasonable suspicion that they are smuggled goods 19. To apply Section 187 to clauses 89 and 90 of Section 156 would amount to limit or narrow down the scope of what is permissible under the said clauses of Section 156 of the Act as a defence; and that cannot be done. Civil Appeal No. 1088 of 2013 etc. 15 The legislature was conscious while using the two legal phrases which have different connotation. Section 187 in general deals with burden of proof as to lawful authority whereas Section 156 deals with punishment for offence. In this context, Section 187 can be regarded as a general provision whereas clauses 89 and 90 are specific provisions and in such a situation the specific provisions to the context must apply to the event/situation under discussion. As such, the accused persons are entitled only to demonstrate a lawful excuse to discharge themselves from the allegation under the said clauses even where the law is conceived to have been violated in respect of the goods i.e. the goods are smuggled goods in absence of import documents, and that is possible courtesy statutory period, disclosed in Section 211 followed by registration book through an official act under the law. A strong presumption is thus attached as a statutory act was performed in the registration of vehicle. 20. The distinction between lawful authority and lawful excuse was highlighted by the Privy Council in the judgment reported as PLD 1955 PC 29 by holding that the defence of lawful excuse may be sufficiently proved although no lawful authority exists for doing what is charged against the accused. Lawful excuse is an expression that is of wider import and lesser degree of burden than lawful authority. It follows from this that proving a lawful excuse, which falls short of lawful authority, it is the excuse put forward by the accused, rather than handling smuggled goods, that must be shown to be lawful. 21. Conceiving the events discussed in show-cause notices with above analysis as a common tool, it demonstrates that the vehicles in question are actually those which were registered through a statutory process and were duly verified and hence would carry lawful excuse. Civil Appeal No. 1088 of 2013 etc. 16 22. This principle however is distinguished for the case where vehicles were found with tampered chassis and engine numbers. If this is seemingly done to match the statistics of original vehicles auctioned or brought into Pakistan officially having different chassis/engine number, the lawful excuse may not be applicable in case of tampered vehicle. This would not include those vehicles which were acquired via auction report explicitly disclosing such tampering and tampered statistics. Also at times the engine and chassis numbers are changed which are also excluded from any action, provided it was done with prior permission of the authority under the Motor Vehicles Ordinance, 1965. All this require thorough probe at the end to applicant which again is a question of fact not required to be determined by us afresh. 23. Learned counsel for the responded/department has mainly emphasized that a proper procedure was adopted while initiating confiscation and/or seizure process. Suffice to say that applying right procedure on wrong person and at the wrong time would not serve any purpose, rather is an abuse of process of law and such actions would be of no help for the department to take corrective measure to curb the smuggling. Such actions ought to have been taken at the time when vehicles were being registered. The appellants should workout some collaborated efforts before and at the time of registration of such vehicles so that this menace may come to an end. A proper joint effort in registration may be a way out. 24. Indeed, the respondents in order to achieve their lawful object of identifying the vehicles and subjected them to such exercise, the concerned directorate, on receipt of credible information of a suspected vehicle from authority concerned, including but not limited to Motor Registration Authority, may take requisite steps. In conducting such exercise a lady Civil Appeal No. 1088 of 2013 etc. 17 custom officer and a lady sepoy should also be aligned to ensure privacy and respect; legal requirement including search under section 162 of the Act be followed and inconvenience to the family must be avoided. 25. The conclusion in the above analysis is that the vehicles in question are those which were either auctioned or were brought into Pakistan and were registered through a statutory process and that the auction papers or registration papers of some other vehicles are not being used fraudulently, however, where it is established that the chassis/engine numbers have been tampered with after auction or registration to match the description of the auctioned or registered vehicle, the lawful excuse is not available. 26. With this understanding the questions have been answered cumulatively and no case for interference is made out and appeals are dismissed. Chief Justice Judge Judge Announced in open Court on 17 April, 2025 at Islamabad.

ii The court had erred in shifting the burden of proof to the authorities whereas under Section 187 as well as under clauses 8 and 89 of Section 156 1 of the Act the burden is on the person who owns or possesses the goods to establish that he had lawful authority or a lawful excuse to possess the same;

Through this appeal, filed under Article\n185(2)(d) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, the\n\nappellants have challenged the vires of the impugned judgment and\n\nCivil Appeal No.151-P of 2013 2\n\ndecree dated 21.01.2013 passed by Peshawar High Court, D.I. Khan\nBench, in revision petition No.52 of 2009.\n2. Facts, in precision, are as such that a patch of land, fully\ndescribed in the plaint, was allotted to Hassan Muhammad son of\nNaseer Khan, who died on his way while migrating to Pakistan from\nIndia at the time of partition of the sub-continent in the year 1947. He\nwas allotted the suit land in District D.I. Khan in lieu of his verified\nclaim No.1388 in Chak No.71/WB, Vehari, Punjab. On getting\nknowledge about the same, Hazrat Nabi, defendant No.1/respondent\nNo.7 allegedly through a fake and fictitious power of attorney\nfraudulently transferred the said land to defendants No.2 to 4/ present\nappellants and respondent No.8 on behalf of the late Hassan\nMuhammad. Muhammad Jamil and five others/respondents No.1 to\n6, purportedly, being legal heirs of the deceased Hassan Muhammad\ninstituted a suit against the said Hazrat Nabi and three others for\ndeclaration to the effect that they were owners in possession of the suit\nland through inheritance from their predecessor in interest namely\nHassan Muhammad and the appellants and respondent No.8/\ndefendants had no concern wit the same. They also sought declaration\nto the effect that the subsequent transfer of the suit land by respondent\nNo.7/defendant No.1 in the name of appellant No.2 on the basis of\nalleged forged and fake general power of attorney through mutations\ndetailed in the plaint are false, based on mala fide, illegal and\nfraudulent, therefore, ineffective upon their rights. They also prayed\nthat the so-called power of attorney, allegedly executed by late Hassan\nMuhammad, their predecessor in interest in favour of respondent\nNo.7/defendant No.1 being fake and fictitious is liable to cancellation.\nAlongwith the suit, the respondents No.1 to 6 also sought perpetual\nand mandatory injunction restraining the appellants and respondent\nNo.8/defendants from interfering in the possession of the suit land;\nthat the appellants and respondent No.8/defendants were asked time\nand again to cope with the demand of the respondents No.1 to 6/\nplaintiffs but they refused and denied; hence, the suit.\n\nThe suit was contested by the appellants and respondents No.7 & 8\nby submitting written statement. The divergence in pleadings of the\n\nparties was summed up into issues by the trial Court. It is notable fact\n\nCivil Appeal No.151-P of 2013 3\n\nthat during proceedings of the suit, a person with name Hassan\nMuhammad appeared before the trial Court and submitted an\napplication for dismissal of the suit by contending therein that\nplaintiffs /respondents No.1 to 6 were neither his relatives nor known\nto him and they have committed fraud to snatch his property; that he\nhas already lodged an FIR No.197 against the plaintiffs on 03.10.1995\nunder sections 419/420/468/471 PPC at Police Station Cantt. D.I.\nKhan, in which the plaintiffs/respondents No.1 to 6 remained in\ngallows. The said Hassan Muhammad produced the copy of the above-\nmentioned FIR, original claim, allotment form and NIC with his\napplication. The Court recorded the statement of Hassan Muhammad\nand dismissed the suit of the plaintiffs /respondents No.1 to 6 with cost\nof Rs.5,000/- vide order dated 29.05.1996. An appeal was preferred\nbefore the District Judge, D.I. Khan against the said order which was\ndismissed vide judgment dated 07.11.1996. Revision petition was filed\nby the respondents No.1 to 6/plaintiffs before the Peshawar High\nCourt, which was accepted on 21.05.1999 and case was remanded\nwith a direction to record evidence of the parties on the following\nadditional issue:\n\nWhether Hassan Muhammad S/O Naseer Khan the original\nclaimant/allottee of the suit land and predecessor-in-interest of\nthe plaintiffs is dead?\n\nAfter remand of the case, the parties produced their pro and contra\nevidence. The trial Court vide judgment and decree dated 30.05.2008\ndismissed suit of the respondents No.1 to 6/plaintiffs, who being\naggrieved preferred an appeal. The appellate Court vide judgment and\ndecree dated 28.01.2009 dismissed the appeal with the following\nobservation:\n\n‘Resultantly, this appeal having no force is dismissed while the\njudgment/order and decree of the learned trial Court dated\n30.5.2008 is maintained. As none of the party i.e. plaintiffs or\ndefendants could establish their respective claim to the suit\nproperty, therefore, the suit property would revert back to the\ncentral government for which the revenue officials be asked to\ndoing the needful. The claim of the plaintiffs being frivolous which\nhas dragged the Courts into controversy since institution of the\nvery suit on 05.9.1995, therefore, compensatory costs of\nRs.10,000/- (Rupees ten thousand) is imposed on the plaintiffs to\nbe deposited in the government treasury.’\n\nCivil Appeal No.151-P of 2013 4\n\nThe respondents No.1 to 6 feeling dissatisfied with the above said\njudgments and decrees filed revision petition bearing No.52 of 2009\nbefore the Peshawar High Court, D.I. Khan Bench, which was accepted\nvide impugned judgment dated 21.01.2013 and while setting aside the\nimpugned judgments and decrees of both the lower Courts, the suit of\nthe respondents No.1 to 6/plaintiffs was decreed as prayed for in the\nplaint. The compensatory cost of Rs.10,000/- imposed upon the\nplaintiffs /respondents No.1 to 6 was also declared null and void.\n\n3. At first, we have to dilate upon and consider the claim of the\nappellants that as to whether they successfully discharged the onus\nwith regards to their entitlement of the disputed land being legal heirs\nof Hassan Muhammad (deceased), the original allottee through verified\nclaim No.1388, Chak No.71/WB in Vehari, Province of Punjab? When\nwe go through the record and ponder upon the same, it divulges that\nthe appellants/plaintiffs narrated a self-drafted pedigree table in the\nplaint, showing their link/relation with Hassan Muhammad\n(deceased), allottee of the disputed land. Neither they produced any\nindependent witness nor produced the pedigree table from the proper\ncustody i.e. revenue hierarchy establishing their relationship with the\ndeceased Hassan Muhammad (original allottee) and even the death\ncertificate of said Hassan Muhammad (deceased) was also not brought\non record showing and establishing his date of death. It is an\nestablished principle of law that mere taking a stance and pleading a\nfact in the plaint or written statement is not sufficient, rather the same\nhas to be proved by leading unimpeachable, confidence inspiring and\nsolid evidence, direct or secondary (after obtaining permission by\nmoving application in this respect). In judgment! this Court has held\nthat:\n\n“It is, indeed, a clear drift rather an outright departure from\nwhat has been pleaded in the plaint. Granted that\naverments made in pleadings do not constitute evidence but\nthe_evidence led in their _support must _be consistent\ntherewith. Anything stated outside the scope of such\naverments cannot be looked into. The rule of secundum\nallegata et probata, not only excludes the element of\nsurprise, but also precludes the party from proving what\nhas not been alleged or pleaded. This Court, in the cases of\n\"Government of West Pakistan (Now Punjab) through\n\n' Muhammad Nawaz alias Nawaza and others vs. Member Judicial Board of Revenue and others (2014\nSCMR 914)\n\nCivil Appeal No.151-P of 2013 5\n\nCollector, Bahawalpur v. Hail Muhammad) (PLD 1976 SC\n469), \"Messrs Choudhary Brothers Ltd., Sialkot v. The\nJaranwala Central Co-operative Bank Ltd., Jaranwala\"\n(1968 SCMR 804), \"Binyameen and 3 others v. Chaudhry\nHakim and another\" (1996 SCMR 336) and “Major (Retd.)\nBarkat Ali and others v. Qaim Din and others\" (2006 SCMR\n562), held that no party can be allowed to lead evidence on\na fact which has not been specifically pleaded nor can any\nevidence be looked into which is outside the scope of\npleadings.” (Underline for emphasis)\n\nIt is a cardinal principle of law that the plea raised, as observed above,\nin the pleading(s) by either of the party, would have no effect in the\nabsence of evidence in proof of the same and does not equate the\nevidence rather the person who asserts a fact in pleading(s) has to\nprove the same by leading evidence, independent and unimpeachable,\nin its support?, which is lacking in this case because the respondents\nNo.1 to 6 could not produce independent evidence and even none of\nthem except plaintiff No.6 Umar Din (P.W.8) entered appearance in the\nwitness box so as to corroborate their stance, pleaded in the plaint;\nthis witness appeared for himself and on behalf of other\nplaintiffs /respondents as their attorney. This witness being beneficiary\nand interested witness, without independent corroboration, especially\nin absence of submission of pedigree table through proper custody,\ncannot be believed. Moreover, non-appearance of other plaintiffs\nexcept P.W.8 in the witness box and depose on oath, as well as, stand\nthe cross examination by rival party, cannot be treated as substantive\nevidence on their behalf. In judgment Mst. Khair-Ul-Nisa? a four-\nmember Bench of this Court held:\n\nIn the present case, unfortunately, Mohammad Hussain Shah\ndied during the pendency of the suit before his evidence was\nrecorded. He, therefore, could not appear in person to state\nwhether he had notice of the original contract or not. There is,\ntherefore, no negative evidence on behalf of the appellants to\ndischarge the burden which lay so heavily on them. Raja\nMohammad Anwar, learned counsel for the appellants, has\ncontended that the deceased had denied the factum of the notice\nin the written statement and this should be considered as\nevidence in the case under section 32 of the Evidence Act. The\ncontention of the learned counsel is not well founded. Written\nstatements cannot be the exhibits in the case without the person\nwho filed the same being examined in the Court. The statements\n\n2 Articles 117 & 118, Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984\n3 Mst. Khair-Ul-Nisa and 6 others v. Malik Muhammad Ishaque and 2 others (PLD\n1972 Supreme Court 25)\n\nCivil Appeal No.151-P of 2013 6\n\nmade in the written statement are not on oath. They are only\nverified and therefore, they cannot be treated as evidence in the\ncase. This view finds support from the case of J. B. Ross & Co. v.\nC. R. Seriven and others (AIR 1917 Cal. 269 (2)) and Muhammad\nSiddique v. Bhupendra Narayan Roy Chowdhury (P L D 1962\nDacca 643). It was held in the former case as under :----\n\"A verification is required with a view to discourage, if not\n'to prevent, the institution of false suits; the Legislature\nnever contemplated that verified statements should be\ntreated as evidence on behalf of a plaintiff against a\ndefendant. 'The inference may legitimately be drawn from\nthe language used in section 191 read with section 193, I.\nP. C., that a verified statement would not be \"evidence\" but\nfor the special provision of section 191 which has been\nenacted for a special purpose.\"\n4. From the above discussion, it can safely be concluded that no\ndoubt the disputed land was allotted to one Hassan Muhammad\n(deceased) but the respondents No.1 to 6 could not establish and prove\ntheir relationship with the said Hassan Muhammad by leading\nconfidence inspiring, trustworthy and independent evidence; therefore,\ntheir suit was rightly dismissed by the trial Court as well as appellate\nCourt and the High Court has wrongly evaluated evidence on record\nwhile setting aside the concurrent judgments and decrees passed by\nthe Courts below.\n5. Now, we consider the claim of the present appellants, defendants\nin the suit, who claimed that Hassan Muhammad through respondent\nNo.7, by executing a purported general power of attorney, transferred\nthe disputed land in their favour through different deeds and\nmutations. It is evident from record that in pre-remand proceedings\nthough one person posing himself as Hassan Muhammad by\nsubmitting his NIC on 21.05.1996 appeared before the trial Court and\nwhile recording his statement admitted the genuineness of the\npurported general power of attorney, executed in favour of the\nrespondent No.7, but in post remand proceedings the present\nappellants neither produced the said person posing himself as Hassan\nMuhammad despite order by the Court in pursuance of order of the\nHigh Court nor brought anything showing his incapability to appear\nbefore the Court or death of said person during the intervening period\nby bringing on record death certificate. Even, the appellants could not\n\nbring on record and exhibit the original purported general power of\n\nattorney so as to strengthen their claim. As observed above, mere\n\nCivil Appeal No.151-P of 2013 7\n\ntaking a plea in pleadings is not sufficient rather the same has to be\nproved by leading evidence; however, in this case, the present\nappellants also failed to prove their stance, taken in their written\nstatement. The stance of the appellants also stood negated by the\ndeposition of P.W.5, who produced letter dated 01.06.2006 by the\nDistrict Registrar, Sahiwal as Ex.P.W.5/12, which depicts that ID Card\nbearing No.334-33-999645 was never issued in the name of Hassan\nMuhammad son of Naseer Khan r/o Chak No.98/6R Tehsil and\nDistrict Sahiwal, therefore, the appellate Court rightly drew inference\nthat the general power of attorney was never executed genuinely and\nthe same is collusive, fraudulent, forged, fictitious and therefore has\nno effect whatsoever. The conclusion can be none but failure of the\nappellants in proving their stance, as well. Therefore, the appellate\nCourt has rightly adjudicated upon the matter in hand while rendering\njudgment and decree dated 28.01.2009.\n\n6. Though the High Court has ample powers to undo and disturb\nthe concurrent findings of the trial Court and first appellate Court in\nexercise of revisional jurisdiction under section 115, Code of Civil\nProcedure, 1908, but, if the same are found to be based on any\nillegality or irregularity and wrong exercise of jurisdiction; however, in\nthe present case no such occasion was available with the High Court;\ntherefore, when the position was as such, the concurrent findings of\nthe Courts, on facts, ought not be interfered with.* Moreover, in\njudgment? this Court has held:\n\n‘Needless to mention that a revisional Court cannot upset a finding\nof fact of the Court(s) below unless that finding is the result of\nmisreading, non-reading, or perverse or absurd appraisal of some\nmaterial evidence. The revisional Court cannot substitute the\nfinding of the Court(s) below with its own merely for the reason\nthat it finds its own finding more plausible than that of the Court(s)\nbelow.’\n\nFurthermore, in Mst. Farzana Zia case® it has invariably been held by\n\nthis Court that:\n\n4 Mst. Zaitoon Begum v. Nazar Hussain and another (2014 SCMR 1469),\nCANTONMENT BOARD through Executive Officer, Cantt. Board Rawalpindi v. IKHLAQ\nAHMED and others (2014 SCMR 161), Muhammad Farid Khan v. Muhammad Ibrahim,\netc. (2017 SCMR 679), Muhammad Sarwar and others v. Hashmal Khan and others\n(PLD 2022 Supreme Court 13) and Mst. Zarsheda v. Nobat Khan (PLD 2022 Supreme\nCourt 21)\n\n5 Salamat Ali and others v. Muhammad Din and others (PLJ 2023 SC 8)\n\n6 Mst. Farzana Zia and others v. Mst. Saadia Andaleeb (2024 SCMR 916)\n\nCivil Appeal No.151-P of 2013 8\n\n‘13. We are sanguine that the High Court has the powers to\nreevaluate the concurrent findings of fact arrived at by the lower\ncourts in appropriate cases but cannot upset such crystalized\nfindings if the same are based on relevant evidence or without\nany misreading or non-reading of evidence. The first appellate\ncourt also expansively re-evaluated and re-examined the entire\nevidence on record. If the facts have been justly tried by two courts\nand the same conclusion has been reached by both the courts\nconcurrently then it would not be judicious to revisit it for drawing\nsome other conclusion or interpretation of evidence in a second\nappeal under section 100 or under revisional jurisdiction under\nsection 115, C.P.C., because any such attempt would also be\nagainst the doctrine of finality.\n\nIt was further held that:\n\nThe High Court cannot substitute its own findings unless it is\nfound that the conclusion drawn by the lower courts were flawed\nor deviant to the erroneous proposition of law or caused serious\nmiscarriage of justice and must also avoid independent re-\nassessment of the evidence to supplant its own conclusion.’\n\n7. The above portrayal ends with the conclusion that the instant\nappeal is accepted, impugned judgment and decree dated 21.01.2013\npassed by Peshawar High Court, D.I. Khan Bench, in revision petition\nNo.52 of 2009 is set aside and that of the appellate Court is restored.\n8. Application bearing C.M.A.No.11-P of 2014 is for impleading\nlegal heirs of respondent No.7; the same is allowed subject to all just\nand legal exceptions. The applications bearing C.M.A.Nos.213-P of\n2017, 530-P of 2018 and 2570 of 2024 have been filed for impleading\nthe respective applicants as respondents, being necessary party, in the\nappeal in hand. In this respect, we observe that as the alleged general\npower of attorney was forged and fictitious, the sale/transfer of\ndisputed land, made on the basis of the said document, is nothing but\na void transaction and on the basis of the same, the subsequent\npurchaser(s) cannot claim their right(s). Therefore, the above C.M.As.\nstand dismissed.\n\n9. Before parting with this judgment, we observe, further, as both\nthe parties have failed to establish their claim and title against the\ndisputed land; therefore, the disputed land would be treated as ‘Nazul\nLand’ and would remit to the Federal Government i.e. status ante and\nwould be disposed of as per rules governing the disposal of “Nazul\n\nland”.

Through this appeal, filed under Article 185 2 d of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, the appellants have challenged the vires of the impugned judgment and Civil Appeal No.151-P of 2013 2 decree dated 21.01.2013 passed by Peshawar High Court, D.I. Khan Bench, in revision petition No.52 of 2009. 2. Facts, in precision, are as such that a patch of land, fully described in the plaint, was allotted to Hassan Muhammad son of Naseer Khan, who died on his way while migrating to Pakistan from India at the time of partition of the sub-continent in the year 1947. He was allotted the suit land in District D.I. Khan in lieu of his verified claim No.1388 in Chak No.71/WB, Vehari, Punjab. On getting knowledge about the same, Hazrat Nabi, defendant No.1/respondent No.7 allegedly through a fake and fictitious power of attorney fraudulently transferred the said land to defendants No.2 to 4/ present appellants and respondent No.8 on behalf of the late Hassan Muhammad. Muhammad Jamil and five others/respondents No.1 to 6, purportedly, being legal heirs of the deceased Hassan Muhammad instituted a suit against the said Hazrat Nabi and three others for declaration to the effect that they were owners in possession of the suit land through inheritance from their predecessor in interest namely Hassan Muhammad and the appellants and respondent No.8/ defendants had no concern wit the same. They also sought declaration to the effect that the subsequent transfer of the suit land by respondent No.7/defendant No.1 in the name of appellant No.2 on the basis of alleged forged and fake general power of attorney through mutations detailed in the plaint are false, based on mala fide, illegal and fraudulent, therefore, ineffective upon their rights. They also prayed that the so-called power of attorney, allegedly executed by late Hassan Muhammad, their predecessor in interest in favour of respondent No.7/defendant No.1 being fake and fictitious is liable to cancellation. Alongwith the suit, the respondents No.1 to 6 also sought perpetual and mandatory injunction restraining the appellants and respondent No.8/defendants from interfering in the possession of the suit land; that the appellants and respondent No.8/defendants were asked time and again to cope with the demand of the respondents No.1 to 6/ plaintiffs but they refused and denied; hence, the suit. The suit was contested by the appellants and respondents No.7 8 by submitting written statement. The divergence in pleadings of the parties was summed up into issues by the trial Court. It is notable fact Civil Appeal No.151-P of 2013 3 that during proceedings of the suit, a person with name Hassan Muhammad appeared before the trial Court and submitted an application for dismissal of the suit by contending therein that plaintiffs /respondents No.1 to 6 were neither his relatives nor known to him and they have committed fraud to snatch his property; that he has already lodged an FIR No.197 against the plaintiffs on 03.10.1995 under sections 419/420/468/471 PPC at Police Station Cantt. D.I. Khan, in which the plaintiffs/respondents No.1 to 6 remained in gallows. The said Hassan Muhammad produced the copy of the abovementioned FIR, original claim, allotment form and NIC with his application. The Court recorded the statement of Hassan Muhammad and dismissed the suit of the plaintiffs /respondents No.1 to 6 with cost of Rs.5,000/- vide order dated 29.05.1996. An appeal was preferred before the District Judge, D.I. Khan against the said order which was dismissed vide judgment dated 07.11.1996. Revision petition was filed by the respondents No.1 to 6/plaintiffs before the Peshawar High Court, which was accepted on 21.05.1999 and case was remanded with a direction to record evidence of the parties on the following additional issue: Whether Hassan Muhammad S/O Naseer Khan the original claimant/allottee of the suit land and predecessor-in-interest of the plaintiffs is dead? After remand of the case, the parties produced their pro and contra evidence. The trial Court vide judgment and decree dated 30.05.2008 dismissed suit of the respondents No.1 to 6/plaintiffs, who being aggrieved preferred an appeal. The appellate Court vide judgment and decree dated 28.01.2009 dismissed the appeal with the following observation: Resultantly, this appeal having no force is dismissed while the judgment/order and decree of the learned trial Court dated 30.5.2008 is maintained. As none of the party i.e. plaintiffs or defendants could establish their respective claim to the suit property, therefore, the suit property would revert back to the central government for which the revenue officials be asked to doing the needful. The claim of the plaintiffs being frivolous which has dragged the Courts into controversy since institution of the very suit on 05.9.1995, therefore, compensatory costs of Rs.10,000/- Rupees ten thousand is imposed on the plaintiffs to be deposited in the government treasury. Civil Appeal No.151-P of 2013 4 The respondents No.1 to 6 feeling dissatisfied with the above said judgments and decrees filed revision petition bearing No.52 of 2009 before the Peshawar High Court, D.I. Khan Bench, which was accepted vide impugned judgment dated 21.01.2013 and while setting aside the impugned judgments and decrees of both the lower Courts, the suit of the respondents No.1 to 6/plaintiffs was decreed as prayed for in the plaint. The compensatory cost of Rs.10,000/- imposed upon the plaintiffs /respondents No.1 to 6 was also declared null and void. 3. At first, we have to dilate upon and consider the claim of the appellants that as to whether they successfully discharged the onus with regards to their entitlement of the disputed land being legal heirs of Hassan Muhammad deceased , the original allottee through verified claim No.1388, Chak No.71/WB in Vehari, Province of Punjab? When we go through the record and ponder upon the same, it divulges that the appellants/plaintiffs narrated a self-drafted pedigree table in the plaint, showing their link/relation with Hassan Muhammad deceased , allottee of the disputed land. Neither they produced any independent witness nor produced the pedigree table from the proper custody i.e. revenue hierarchy establishing their relationship with the deceased Hassan Muhammad original allottee and even the death certificate of said Hassan Muhammad deceased was also not brought on record showing and establishing his date of death. It is an established principle of law that mere taking a stance and pleading a fact in the plaint or written statement is not sufficient, rather the same has to be proved by leading unimpeachable, confidence inspiring and solid evidence, direct or secondary after obtaining permission by moving application in this respect . In judgment! this Court has held that: It is, indeed, a clear drift rather an outright departure from what has been pleaded in the plaint. Granted that averments made in pleadings do not constitute evidence but the evidence led in their support must be consistent therewith. Anything stated outside the scope of such averments cannot be looked into. The rule of secundum allegata et probata, not only excludes the element of surprise, but also precludes the party from proving what has not been alleged or pleaded. This Court, in the cases of Government of West Pakistan Now Punjab through Muhammad Nawaz alias Nawaza and others vs. Member Judicial Board of Revenue and others 2014 SCMR 914 Civil Appeal No.151-P of 2013 5 Collector, Bahawalpur v. Hail Muhammad PLD 1976 SC 469 , Messrs Choudhary Brothers Ltd., Sialkot v. The Jaranwala Central Co-operative Bank Ltd., Jaranwala 1968 SCMR 804 , Binyameen and 3 others v. Chaudhry Hakim and another 1996 SCMR 336 and Major Retd. Barkat Ali and others v. Qaim Din and others 2006 SCMR 562 , held that no party can be allowed to lead evidence on a fact which has not been specifically pleaded nor can any evidence be looked into which is outside the scope of pleadings. Underline for emphasis It is a cardinal principle of law that the plea raised, as observed above, in the pleading s by either of the party, would have no effect in the absence of evidence in proof of the same and does not equate the evidence rather the person who asserts a fact in pleading s has to prove the same by leading evidence, independent and unimpeachable, in its support?, which is lacking in this case because the respondents No.1 to 6 could not produce independent evidence and even none of them except plaintiff No.6 Umar Din P.W.8 entered appearance in the witness box so as to corroborate their stance, pleaded in the plaint; this witness appeared for himself and on behalf of other plaintiffs /respondents as their attorney. This witness being beneficiary and interested witness, without independent corroboration, especially in absence of submission of pedigree table through proper custody, cannot be believed. Moreover, non-appearance of other plaintiffs except P.W.8 in the witness box and depose on oath, as well as, stand the cross examination by rival party, cannot be treated as substantive evidence on their behalf. In judgment Mst. Khair-Ul-Nisa? a fourmember Bench of this Court held: In the present case, unfortunately, Mohammad Hussain Shah died during the pendency of the suit before his evidence was recorded. He, therefore, could not appear in person to state whether he had notice of the original contract or not. There is, therefore, no negative evidence on behalf of the appellants to discharge the burden which lay so heavily on them. Raja Mohammad Anwar, learned counsel for the appellants, has contended that the deceased had denied the factum of the notice in the written statement and this should be considered as evidence in the case under section 32 of the Evidence Act. The contention of the learned counsel is not well founded. Written statements cannot be the exhibits in the case without the person who filed the same being examined in the Court. The statements 2 Articles 117 118, Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 3 Mst. Khair-Ul-Nisa and 6 others v. Malik Muhammad Ishaque and 2 others PLD 1972 Supreme Court 25 Civil Appeal No.151-P of 2013 6 made in the written statement are not on oath. They are only verified and therefore, they cannot be treated as evidence in the case. This view finds support from the case of J. B. Ross Co. v. C. R. Seriven and others AIR 1917 Cal. 269 2 and Muhammad Siddique v. Bhupendra Narayan Roy Chowdhury P L D 1962 Dacca 643 . It was held in the former case as under :---- A verification is required with a view to discourage, if not to prevent, the institution of false suits; the Legislature never contemplated that verified statements should be treated as evidence on behalf of a plaintiff against a defendant. The inference may legitimately be drawn from the language used in section 191 read with section 193, I. P. C., that a verified statement would not be evidence but for the special provision of section 191 which has been enacted for a special purpose. 4. From the above discussion, it can safely be concluded that no doubt the disputed land was allotted to one Hassan Muhammad deceased but the respondents No.1 to 6 could not establish and prove their relationship with the said Hassan Muhammad by leading confidence inspiring, trustworthy and independent evidence; therefore, their suit was rightly dismissed by the trial Court as well as appellate Court and the High Court has wrongly evaluated evidence on record while setting aside the concurrent judgments and decrees passed by the Courts below. 5. Now, we consider the claim of the present appellants, defendants in the suit, who claimed that Hassan Muhammad through respondent No.7, by executing a purported general power of attorney, transferred the disputed land in their favour through different deeds and mutations. It is evident from record that in pre-remand proceedings though one person posing himself as Hassan Muhammad by submitting his NIC on 21.05.1996 appeared before the trial Court and while recording his statement admitted the genuineness of the purported general power of attorney, executed in favour of the respondent No.7, but in post remand proceedings the present appellants neither produced the said person posing himself as Hassan Muhammad despite order by the Court in pursuance of order of the High Court nor brought anything showing his incapability to appear before the Court or death of said person during the intervening period by bringing on record death certificate. Even, the appellants could not bring on record and exhibit the original purported general power of attorney so as to strengthen their claim. As observed above, mere Civil Appeal No.151-P of 2013 7 taking a plea in pleadings is not sufficient rather the same has to be proved by leading evidence; however, in this case, the present appellants also failed to prove their stance, taken in their written statement. The stance of the appellants also stood negated by the deposition of P.W.5, who produced letter dated 01.06.2006 by the District Registrar, Sahiwal as Ex.P.W.5/12, which depicts that ID Card bearing No.334-33-999645 was never issued in the name of Hassan Muhammad son of Naseer Khan r/o Chak No.98/6R Tehsil and District Sahiwal, therefore, the appellate Court rightly drew inference that the general power of attorney was never executed genuinely and the same is collusive, fraudulent, forged, fictitious and therefore has no effect whatsoever. The conclusion can be none but failure of the appellants in proving their stance, as well. Therefore, the appellate Court has rightly adjudicated upon the matter in hand while rendering judgment and decree dated 28.01.2009. 6. Though the High Court has ample powers to undo and disturb the concurrent findings of the trial Court and first appellate Court in exercise of revisional jurisdiction under section 115, Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, but, if the same are found to be based on any illegality or irregularity and wrong exercise of jurisdiction; however, in the present case no such occasion was available with the High Court; therefore, when the position was as such, the concurrent findings of the Courts, on facts, ought not be interfered with. Moreover, in judgment? this Court has held: Needless to mention that a revisional Court cannot upset a finding of fact of the Court s below unless that finding is the result of misreading, non-reading, or perverse or absurd appraisal of some material evidence. The revisional Court cannot substitute the finding of the Court s below with its own merely for the reason that it finds its own finding more plausible than that of the Court s below. Furthermore, in Mst. Farzana Zia case it has invariably been held by this Court that: 4 Mst. Zaitoon Begum v.

Saadia Andaleeb 2024 SCMR 916 Civil Appeal No.151-P of 2013 8 13. We are sanguine that the High Court has the powers to reevaluate the concurrent findings of fact arrived at by the lower courts in appropriate cases but cannot upset such crystalized findings if the same are based on relevant evidence or without any misreading or non-reading of evidence. The first appellate court also expansively re-evaluated and re-examined the entire evidence on record. If the facts have been justly tried by two courts and the same conclusion has been reached by both the courts concurrently then it would not be judicious to revisit it for drawing some other conclusion or interpretation of evidence in a second appeal under section 100 or under revisional jurisdiction under section 115, C.P.C., because any such attempt would also be against the doctrine of finality. It was further held that: The High Court cannot substitute its own findings unless it is found that the conclusion drawn by the lower courts were flawed or deviant to the erroneous proposition of law or caused serious miscarriage of justice and must also avoid independent reassessment of the evidence to supplant its own conclusion. 7. The above portrayal ends with the conclusion that the instant appeal is accepted, impugned judgment and decree dated 21.01.2013 passed by Peshawar High Court, D.I. Khan Bench, in revision petition No.52 of 2009 is set aside and that of the appellate Court is restored. 8. Application bearing C.M.A.No.11-P of 2014 is for impleading legal heirs of respondent No.7; the same is allowed subject to all just and legal exceptions. The applications bearing C.M.A.Nos.213-P of 2017, 530-P of 2018 and 2570 of 2024 have been filed for impleading the respective applicants as respondents, being necessary party, in the appeal in hand. In this respect, we observe that as the alleged general power of attorney was forged and fictitious, the sale/transfer of disputed land, made on the basis of the said document, is nothing but a void transaction and on the basis of the same, the subsequent purchaser s cannot claim their right s . Therefore, the above C.M.As. stand dismissed. 9.

P. C., that a verified statement would not be evidence but for the special provision of section 191 which has been enacted for a special purpose.", "From the above discussion, it can safely be concluded that no doubt the disputed land was allotted to one Hassan Muhammad deceased but the respondents No.1 to 6 could not establish and prove their relationship with the said Hassan Muhammad by leading confidence inspiring, trustworthy and independent evidence; therefore, their suit was rightly dismissed by the trial Court as well as appellate Court and the High Court has wrongly evaluated evidence on record while setting aside the concurrent judgments and decrees passed by the Courts below.", "Now, we consider the claim of the present appellants, defendants in the suit, who claimed that Hassan Muhammad through respondent No.7, by executing a purported general power of attorney, transferred the disputed land in their favour through different deeds and mutations.", "It is evident from record that in pre-remand proceedings though one person posing himself as Hassan Muhammad by submitting his NIC on 21.05.1996 appeared before the trial Court and while recording his statement admitted the genuineness of the purported general power of attorney, executed in favour of the respondent No.7, but in post remand proceedings the present appellants neither produced the said person posing himself as Hassan Muhammad despite order by the Court in pursuance of order of the High Court nor brought anything showing his incapability to appear before the Court or death of said person during the intervening period by bringing on record death certificate.", "Even, the appellants could not bring on record and exhibit the original purported general power of attorney so as to strengthen their claim.", "As observed above, mere Civil Appeal No.151-P of 2013 7 taking a plea in pleadings is not sufficient rather the same has to be proved by leading evidence; however, in this case, the present appellants also failed to prove their stance, taken in their written statement.", "The stance of the appellants also stood negated by the deposition of P.W.5, who produced letter dated 01.06.2006 by the District Registrar, Sahiwal as Ex.P.W.5/12, which depicts that ID Card bearing No.334-33-999645 was never issued in the name of Hassan Muhammad son of Naseer Khan r/o Chak No.98/6R Tehsil and District Sahiwal, therefore, the appellate Court rightly drew inference that the general power of attorney was never executed genuinely and the same is collusive, fraudulent, forged, fictitious and therefore has no effect whatsoever.", "The conclusion can be none but failure of the appellants in proving their stance, as well.", "Therefore, the appellate Court has rightly adjudicated upon the matter in hand while rendering judgment and decree dated 28.01.2009.", "Though the High Court has ample powers to undo and disturb the concurrent findings of the trial Court and first appellate Court in exercise of revisional jurisdiction under section 115, Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, but, if the same are found to be based on any illegality or irregularity and wrong exercise of jurisdiction; however, in the present case no such occasion was available with the High Court; therefore, when the position was as such, the concurrent findings of the Courts, on facts, ought not be interfered with.", "this Court has held: Needless to mention that a revisional Court cannot upset a finding of fact of the Court s below unless that finding is the result of misreading, non-reading, or perverse or absurd appraisal of some material evidence.", "The revisional Court cannot substitute the finding of the Court s below with its own merely for the reason that it finds its own finding more plausible than that of the Court s below.", "Farzana Zia case it has invariably been held by this Court that: 4 Mst.", "Zaitoon Begum v.

The controversy in hand revolves around a\ndower deed whereby one Mst. Kishwara claimed herself to be the owner and\nconsequently gifted the property on 26.11.1997 in favour of one Muhammad\nIsrar. The prime consideration was and is whether she has successfully\nproved the title by virtue of dower deed allegedly executed by her husband\n\nMasahib Shah on 24.06.1960.\n\n2. On this count alone we have heard the learned counsel for the\nappellant and perused the material available on record.

Once such dower deed stands\nproved only then the question of conveying title by whatever means\n\nincluding but not limited to gift deed would have been possible.\n\n3. The two suits; one filed by Muhammad Israr and the other filed by one\n\nJehanzeb were consolidated. Earlier the suit filed by Muhammad Israr for\n\nCivil Appeal No. 156-P of 2013 2\n\ndeclaration was consented by Mst. Kishwara in respect of 4 % marlas of land\non 09.02.1999, which was challenged by Mst. Naseem and Marifat Shah\nunder section 12(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (‘CPC’) and\nchallenge was successful. Later on, Jehanzeb filed a suit for declaration-\ncum-possession via partition on 08.10.2008. The two suits were then\nconsolidated. Mst. Kishwara was the maternal aunt of Muhammad Israr,\nwho obtained a consent decree in a span of 9 days from the civil court stated\nabove. On consolidation of the two suits, the Civil Judge, Charsadda vide\nconsolidated judgment dated 18.05.2010 dismissed the suit filed by\nMuhammad Israr (Civil Suit No.13/1), whereas, decreed the suit of\nJehanzeb (Civil Suit No.12/1). Both the parties aggrieved by the said\nconsolidated judgment and decree filed their respective appeals before the\nAdditional District Judge, Charsadda. The two appeals were consolidated\nand a common judgment was passed dated 30.05.2011. Appeal of\nMuhammad Israr (Civil Appeal No.65/13) was accepted and his suit was\ndecreed, whereas, the other appeal (Civil Appeal No.74/ 13) filed by Jehanzeb\nwas dismissed. Consequently, Jehanzeb challenged the consolidated\njudgment and decree of the first appellate court in a civil revision before the\n\nPeshawar High Court, Peshawar.\n\n4. We have perused the impugned judgment carefully. The jurisdiction\nvested with the revisional court was exercised under section 115 of the CPC\nand revisional court was competent to exercise all the said enabling powers\n\nunder section 115 of the CPC which it did.\n\n5. The dower deed which is more than thirty years old claimed to have\npresumption of genuineness but that presumption is always rebuttable by\nthe party questioning genuineness thereof. Indeed the unsuspicious\ncharacter of a document, its proper custody and other circumstances are\n\nthe foundation to raise presumption of its execution, however, if prima-facie,\n\nCivil Appeal No. 156-P of 2013 3\n\nthe dispute to its execution and proper custody is raised then it becomes\nthe duty of the court to determine the question of its genuineness. The\npresumption is thus discretionary and not mandatory in terms of the case\n\nof Allah Ditta_v. Aimna_ Bibi (2011 SCMR 1483). The presumption of\n\ncorrectness of a document available under the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order,\n1984 in respect of thirty years old document, subject to above, is only in\nrespect of a signature and every other part thereof in handwriting of a\nparticular person. Rest of the contents which are not in the handwriting\nwould then become the subject matter of proof. The other aspect of the\nmatter which germane to the requirement of law is that the subject\ndocument should be produced by person having proper custody in terms of\nArticle 100 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. Production of document\npurported or proved to be thirty years old from “proper custody” was the\ncondition precedent; until and unless such condition is met, no\npresumption as to the signature, contents or any part of such document to\nbe duly executed/attested, would arise. Indeed the subject document was\nproduced by scriber who, for the purposes of the present controversy does\n\nnot have a proper custody.\n\n6. The outcome of evidence recorded in the trial court was that\nMuhammad Israr remained unsuccessful in establishing that a dower deed\nwas executed whereby a title of Masahib Shah in respect of house measuring\n4 % marlas was conveyed to Mst. Kishwara as dower. It may have been a\nmatter of record that a gift deed was executed subsequently, but it is an\nundeniable fact that under a gift deed a title could only be conveyed if the\ndonor is enjoying such title. The donor being Mst. Kishwara was unable to\nsatisfy through reliable evidence that by virtue of a dower deed the title of\nthe house was conveyed to her. It may have been several decades old\n\ninstrument but that alone would not succeed if a doubt is created about the\n\nCivil Appeal No. 156-P of 2013 4\n\ngenuineness of the document. The corroborative evidence should have been\nmade available before the trial court and first appellate court. The trial court\nfound it to be a case of lack of evidence and consequently dismissed the suit\nof Muhammad Israr whereas the suit for partition filed by the Jehanzeb was\ndecreed by the trial court. The first appellate court reversed the findings\nwhereas the revisional court restored it. It was within the competence of the\nrevisional court to see whether (i) the courts below had exercised jurisdiction\nnot vested in it or (ii) the courts below have failed to exercise jurisdiction so\nvested or (iii) the courts below have acted in the exercise of its jurisdiction\nillegally or with material irregularity. Indeed, when the dower deed came for\nconsideration, it remained an unsuccessful attempt as far as proving of the\ninstrument is concerned. It may have been “produced” as stated above but\nthe fact remained that it was not “proved” to the satisfaction of the trial court\n\nand that of the revisional court.\n\n7. We do not exercise the jurisdiction to re-appraise the evidence for\nanother view. The jurisdiction exercised by the revisional court and the\nconclusion drawn is the outcome of the record available in terms of the\nevidence. We, therefore, are not inclined to interfere in the conclusion drawn\nby the revisional court which in fact has restored the conclusion of the trial\n\ncourt while deciding the two suits vide consolidated judgment dated\n\n18.05.2010.\n\n8.

The jurisdiction vested with the revisional court was exercised under section 115 of the CPC and revisional court was competent to exercise all the said enabling powers under section 115 of the CPC which it did. 5. The dower deed which is more than thirty years old claimed to have presumption of genuineness but that presumption is always rebuttable by the party questioning genuineness thereof. Indeed the unsuspicious character of a document, its proper custody and other circumstances are the foundation to raise presumption of its execution, however, if prima-facie, Civil Appeal No. 156-P of 2013 3 the dispute to its execution and proper custody is raised then it becomes the duty of the court to determine the question of its genuineness. The presumption is thus discretionary and not mandatory in terms of the case of Allah Ditta v. Aimna Bibi 2011 SCMR 1483 . The presumption of correctness of a document available under the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 in respect of thirty years old document, subject to above, is only in respect of a signature and every other part thereof in handwriting of a particular person. Rest of the contents which are not in the handwriting would then become the subject matter of proof. The other aspect of the matter which germane to the requirement of law is that the subject document should be produced by person having proper custody in terms of Article 100 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. Production of document purported or proved to be thirty years old from proper custody was the condition precedent; until and unless such condition is met, no presumption as to the signature, contents or any part of such document to be duly executed/attested, would arise. Indeed the subject document was produced by scriber who, for the purposes of the present controversy does not have a proper custody. 6. The outcome of evidence recorded in the trial court was that Muhammad Israr remained unsuccessful in establishing that a dower deed was executed whereby a title of Masahib Shah in respect of house measuring 4 marlas was conveyed to Mst. Kishwara as dower. It may have been a matter of record that a gift deed was executed subsequently, but it is an undeniable fact that under a gift deed a title could only be conveyed if the donor is enjoying such title. The donor being Mst. Kishwara was unable to satisfy through reliable evidence that by virtue of a dower deed the title of the house was conveyed to her. It may have been several decades old instrument but that alone would not succeed if a doubt is created about the Civil Appeal No. 156-P of 2013 4 genuineness of the document. The corroborative evidence should have been made available before the trial court and first appellate court. The trial court found it to be a case of lack of evidence and consequently dismissed the suit of Muhammad Israr whereas the suit for partition filed by the Jehanzeb was decreed by the trial court. The first appellate court reversed the findings whereas the revisional court restored it. It was within the competence of the revisional court to see whether i the courts below had exercised jurisdiction not vested in it or ii the courts below have failed to exercise jurisdiction so vested or iii the courts below have acted in the exercise of its jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity. Indeed, when the dower deed came for consideration, it remained an unsuccessful attempt as far as proving of the instrument is concerned. It may have been produced as stated above but the fact remained that it was not proved to the satisfaction of the trial court and that of the revisional court. 7. We do not exercise the jurisdiction to re-appraise the evidence for another view. The jurisdiction exercised by the revisional court and the conclusion drawn is the outcome of the record available in terms of the evidence.

Because of some issues with the society, the allottee\nstopped payment of further dues and a petition under section 54 of the\n\nCooperative Societies Act, 1925 (The Act) was filed before the Deputy\n\nCPLA No.1378-1/2013 and 1563-L/2018\n\nDistrict Officer Cooperative, Lahore, but during pendency of the said\npetition, a merger between Defence Housing Authority (the Authority) and\nthe Society took place. But during this process, the management of the\nSociety cancelled the allotment of plot of the allotee before its merger\nwithout any lawful authority or issuing any show cause notice, The\nallottee then approached Registrar of the Cooperative Societies who vide\nits order dated 15.02.2012 restored his membership and directed The\nSociety to either refund the amount paid by the allottee or allot him\nalternate plot. The allottee, feeling aggrieved then approached the\nSecretary, Cooperative Societies who after hearing both the parties\nmodified the order of the Registrar and directed The Authority to allot plot\nNo.78-B as previously allotted to the allottee or allot him an alternate plot\nof the same value. The Authority feeling aggrieved approached the Lahore\nHigh Court, Lahore through constitutional petition and raised the question\nof jurisdiction that after merger of the Society with the Authority, the\nappeal before the Secretary, Cooperative Societies was not maintainable\nand as such the order of the Secretary was without jurisdiction and lawful\nauthority. The learned counsel for the petitioner while admitting the fact of\nmerger and also admitting the fact of acceptance all the liabilities of the\nSociety after the merger, again reagitated the same question of\njurisdiction.

The learned Law\n\nOfficer also supported the orders of the fora below and the High Court.\n\n3. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have gone\nthrough the available record. The record of the case reveals that the\nrespondent No.3 is undisputedly a member of the Society and also an\nallottee of a plot by the Society. The merger as per available record took\nplace vide agreement dated 12.08.2006 and as per agreement, now it is\nthe Authority to handover the possession of the allotted plots to the\nowners/allottees of the Society and all such allottees of the Society would\nbe deemed to be the members of the Authority in accordance with the\nrules, regulation and the by-laws of the Authority.

Learned counsel added that the Trial Court as well\nas the High Court had not properly appreciated the evidence\navailable on record in its true sense and passed the judgments\nwhich are not sustainable in the eye of law.\n\n3. Conversely, learned counsel for Respondents No.1 to 6\n(Haji Muhammad Essa etc) while opposing the contentions of the\nlearned counsel for the Appellant submitted that Haji Muhammad\nEssa (Respondent No.1) purchased the suit property from\nMuhammad Ibrahim (landlord) who in consideration appointed\nRespondent No.1 as his lawful attorney through an irrevocable\nGeneral Power of Attorney (Ex.P31). It was next argued that it was\nonly after the death of Muhammad Ibrahim (landlord) when his son\nAbdul Fateh (Respondent No.7) approached the revenue authorities\nwith unclean hands and got the inheritance mutation attested in\nhis favour being sole legal heir of deceased Muhammad Ibrahim.\nLearned counsel lastly argued that the revenue authorities without\nfollowing the due process, cancelled entries relating to mutation\nNo.167 and mutation No.170 and attested entry of inheritance\nmutation No.173 in favour of Abdul Fateh (Respondent No.7) which is\nillegal and void; hence supported the findings given by the Trial\nCourt in its judgment dated 29.10.2007 upheld by the High Court\nin the impugned judgment dated 15.08.2013.\n\n4. Heard. Record perused.\n\n5. It is to be noted that this appeal is by the subsequent\nvendee and arises out of a suit initially brought by Respondent\nNo.1. Subsequently, Respondents No.2 to 6 were added as\nplaintiffs. The subject matter of this suit comprised of five\ntransactions and we may easily divide them in two categories. In\nthe first, we may include those transactions which took place\nbefore institution of the suit whereas the second related to the\ntransactions which came about during the trial of the suit.\n\n6. The dispute in this case is about the property\nmeasuring 5141 sq.ft. bearing Khasra No.130, situated at Ward\nNo.32, Tappa Urban, Tehsil and District Quetta, originally owned\nby Muhammad Ibrahim (landlord).\n\n7. Without further ado, we review the first category of\ntransactions. Respondent No.1 claimed that Muhammad Ibrahim\n\norally sold the property to him on 4th of April, 1990 for\n\nC.A.No.1414 of 2013 -3-\n\nRs.315,000/- and in consideration appointed him as his lawful\nattorney of the property through an irrevocable General Power of\nAttorney (Ex.P.31) and based on this, on 8th of September, 1997 he\ntransferred the property to his three sons (Respondents No.2, 3 and 6)\nvide mutation No.167 (Ex.P.34), they further transferred an area of\n2000 sq.ft. to Respondents No.4 and 5 vide mutation No.170 dated\n4th of October, 1997. He further said that Muhammad Ibrahim\ndied on 20th of September, 1995. After his death, his son namely\nAbdul Fateh (Respondent No.7) applied to Respondent No.9 to cancel\nmutations No.167 and 170 which were accordingly cancelled. This\ncancellation was cited as a cause to bring a suit by which\nRespondents No.1 to 6 sought a declaration that the cancellation of\nmutations No.167 and 170 by Respondent No.9 was illegal. The\nsuit was instituted on 10th of June, 1999. The Trial Court checked\nthe truth of these facts under Issues No.1 to 3. Considering the\nevidence brought on record, the Trial Court by its judgment dated\n29th of October, 2007 found the facts relating to the first category\nof transaction in favour of Respondents No.1 to 6. It declared\nRespondents No.1 to 6 as lawful owners and directed Respondent\nNo.9 to mutate the property in their favour. This declaration was\nneither challenged by Respondent No.7 in the High Court nor in\nthis Court.\n\n8. Now, we focus on the second category of transactions\nthat materialised during the trial of the suit. [It happened that\nRespondent No.7 (son of Muhammad Ibrahim) taking advantage of the\ncancellation of mutations No.167 and 170 sold the property to the\npresent Appellant by mutation No.220 dated Sth of April, 2003.\nSubsequently, the Appellant joined the suit as defendant No.4. He\ncontested the claim of Respondents No.1 to 6. His transaction was\nexamined under additional Issue No.4 and was not found valid. In\nlight of this fact, we sked the Appellant’s counsel whether the\ndoctrine of lis pendens did not hit the sale in favour of the\nAppellant. In answer to this question, he referred us to the\nstatement of the Appellant in which he stated that Respondent No.7\ninherited the property from his father Muhammad Ibrahim and on\n28th of February, 2003 he sold it to him for Rs.3,000,000/- and\nthat this sale was incorporated in the revenue records vide\nmutation No.220 dated 5th of April, 2003. He then took us to the\nproceedings sheet of the Trial Court and submitted that on 28th of\n\nC.A.No.1414 of 2013 hie\n\nFebruary, 2003 the suit was dismissed and contended that since\nthe sale was made after it, the doctrine of lis pendens would not\nattract to it. This argument sans merit. There is no denying that\nthe suit was dismissed on 28th of February, 2003 and then\nrestored on 11th of April, 2003 and during this interregnum,\nRespondent No.7 sold the property to the Appellant. It is now well\nsettled that if a suit is dismissed and then restored, the restoration\norder relates back and a transfer/sale after dismissal and before\nrestoration is subjected to the principle of lis pendens embodied in\nSection 52 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882!.\n\n9. It is now clear that the suit giving rise to this appeal,\nwas related to a specific immovable property in which the rights of\nthe parties were directly and specifically in question and that suit\nwas not disposed of by a final decree when the property was sold to\nthe Appellant. We have minutely examined the memorandum of\ninstant appeal and the documents attached to it to find out\nwhether the Appellant, at any stage, had taken the plea that the\nsuit was collusive or was meant to entrap him. We find that this\nhad never been the standpoint of the Appellant. Given the\ncircumstances, the Appellant has no standing to take up cudgels\non behalf of his transferor, to wit, Respondent No.7 and seek\ndismissal of the suit on the ground that his transferor was the\nlawful owner of the property and that Respondent No.1 based on\nGeneral Power of Attorney could not transfer the property to other\nRespondents. The Appellant, even though purchaser for value,\nwithout notice of the pendency of the suit shall be bound by the\nresult of the first category of transaction, as his transferor\n(Respondent No.7) had accepted it by not challenging it before any\nhigher forum. The Appellant, therefore, does not acquire any legal\ntitle free from the clog of his unsuccessful transferor, in whose\nshoes he steps in for all intents and purposes and has to swim and\nsink with his transferor.\n\n10. Besides, the property-in-question was recorded in the\nnames of Respondents No.3, 5 and 6 but the Tehsildar, on a\nrequest from Respondent No.7, cancelled mutations No.167 and\n170 without notice and without providing them the opportunity of\nhearing which act is in contravention of Article 10-A of the\nConstitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 as well as\n\n' Ashutosh Roy v. Ananta Ram Bhattacharjee [1919 IC 727] &\nMuhammad Ashraf Butt and others v. Muhammad Asif Bhatti and others [PLD 2011 SC 905]\n\nC.A.No.1414 of 2013 -5-\n\ncontrary to the provisions of the Land Revenue Act, 1967. Hence,\nthe High Court had rightly directed the revenue authorities to\nrestore the mutations in respect of the property measuring 5141\nsq.ft. bearing Khasra No.130, situated at Ward No.32, Tappa\nUrban, Tehsil and District Quetta, on the names of Respondents\nNo.3, 5 and 6.\n\n11. So viewed, we see no reason to upset the concurrent\nfindings of the Courts below and find this appeal bereft of any\n\nmerit. It is accordingly dismissed with no order as to costs.\n\nIslamabad\nApproved for reporting\n\nrh\nANNOUNCED IN OPEN COURT ON 3” Of Octo ler 2024", "CleanedText": "JUDGMENT Musarrat Hilali, J.

He further said that Muhammad Ibrahim died on 20th of September, 1995. After his death, his son namely Abdul Fateh Respondent No.7 applied to Respondent No.9 to cancel mutations No.167 and 170 which were accordingly cancelled. This cancellation was cited as a cause to bring a suit by which Respondents No.1 to 6 sought a declaration that the cancellation of mutations No.167 and 170 by Respondent No.9 was illegal.

It declared Respondents No.1 to 6 as lawful owners and directed Respondent No.9 to mutate the property in their favour. This declaration was neither challenged by Respondent No.7 in the High Court nor in this Court. 8. Now, we focus on the second category of transactions that materialised during the trial of the suit. It happened that Respondent No.7 son of Muhammad Ibrahim taking advantage of the cancellation of mutations No.167 and 170 sold the property to the present Appellant by mutation No.220 dated Sth of April, 2003.

It is now well settled that if a suit is dismissed and then restored, the restoration order relates back and a transfer/sale after dismissal and before restoration is subjected to the principle of lis pendens embodied in Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882!. 9.

The petitions were converted into appeals\n\npursuant to grant of leave vide order dated 27-06-2013.\n\n2. All the appeals, except one, have arisen from the judgment of the\nHigh Court of Sindh, dated 22-02-2013, while the latter assails the\nconsolidated judgment passed by the Lahore High Court. The\nconstitutional petitions filed before the High Court of Sindh were\nallowed and the department has challenged the consolidated judgment,\n\nwhile the petitions filed before the Lahore High Court were dismissed.\n\nCA 749/13 etc.\n\nAs will be explained later, the consolidated judgment of the Lahore High\n\nCourt was upheld by this Court and thus it has attained finality.\n\n3. The dispute was regarding the vires of section 3A of the Federal\nExcise Act 2005 (‘Act of 2005’) and the notification issued by the\nFederal Government in exercise of powers conferred there under. A Bill\nwas introduced in the National Assembly of the Majlis-e-Shoora\n(Parliament) and it was passed on 22.6.2007. The object was to amend\nthe Act of 2005 by inserting of a new provision i.e. section 3A. It\nreceived the assent of the President on 30-06-2007. The Finance Act\n2007 was thereafter published in the official gazette and the insertion of\nsection 3A took effect on 01-07-2007. Section 3A, which was inserted\nthrough the Finance Act 2007, had empowered the Federal Government\nto levy and collect, subject to such conditions, limitations or restrictions\nas it may deem fit to impose, special excise duty on goods produced or\nmanufactured in Pakistan and goods imported into Pakistan. The\nexercise of this power was through the publication of a notification in\nthe official gazette. The legislature had expressly fixed the rate of the\nlevy and collection as one percent of the value of the specified goods.\nSubsequently, the rate was increased to two and half percent of the\nvalue through the Federal Excise (Amendment) Ordinance, 2011. It is\nnoted that section 3A was omitted through the Finance Act 2011 which\nwas assented on 29.06.2011. The Federal Government had issued a\nnotification i.e. S.R.O. 655(I)/2007, dated 29.6.2007 (‘Notification’),\nspecifying the goods for the purposes of levy and collection of the\nspecial excise duty under section 3A of the Act of 2005. It was explicitly\nstated in the notification that it shall take effect on 01.07.2007. The\nNotification was assailed before the Lahore High Court by several\naggrieved persons but they had not questioned the vires of section 3A of\n\nthe Act of 2005. The petitions were dismissed by a Single Judge vide\n\nCA 749/13 etc.\n\njudgment dated 30.5.2011 and the Intra Court Appeals heard by a\nDivision Bench were also dismissed vide judgment dated 27.6.2011.\nThe said judgment was assailed before this Court by seeking leave\nunder Article 185(3) of the Constitution. A Bench, consisting of three\nJudges of this Court, refused to grant leave and consequently dismissed\nthe petitions vide judgment dated 18.10.2011.1 This Court had\nobserved that no prejudice or injustice was caused because the\nnotification was acted upon after 01.07.2007 when insertion of section\n3A had also taken effect. It is not disputed that the judgment of the\nLahore High Court had attained finality. However, one of the petitions,\ni.e. CPLA No.1625-L of 2011, which had also assailed the consolidated\njudgment of the Lahore High Court, could not be fixed with the other\npetitions. This petition came up for hearing much later and it was\nconverted into an appeal i.e. CA 749 of 2013, pursuant to leave having\nbeen granted vide order dated 27.6.2013. The petition was fixed and\nheard along with multiple petitions that had assailed the judgment of\nthe High Court of Sindh. We have observed that the crucial fact\nregarding the dismissal of several petitions and upholding the judgment\nof the Lahore High Court by this Court was not brought to the attention\nof the Bench which appears to have led to grant of leave. Nonetheless,\nthe consolidated judgment of the Lahore High Court, which had\nsustained the vires of the Notification, had already attained finality\nsince leave was refused and all the petitions, except the aforementioned\npetition, filed under Article 185(3) of the Constitution were dismissed.\nThe vires of section 3A and the Notification had also been assailed by\naggrieved persons before the High Court of Sindh. The petitions were\nallowed through a consolidated judgment dated 22.02.2013 and\n\nconsequently section 3A was declared void ab initio, a nullity in law and\n\n*Shakarganj Sugar Mills and others v. Government of Pakistan and others (PTCL 2012 CL 604)\n\nCA 749/13 etc.\n\nof no legal effect. The Notification was likewise declared a nullity and of\nno legal effect. The High Court had held that section 3A, inserted in the\nAct of 2005, was hit by the doctrine of impermissible and excessive\ndelegation of legislative power to the delegatee i.e. Federal Government\n\nand therefore, it was struck down on this sole ground.\n\n4. We have heard the learned counsels for the parties at great length\n\nand their written submissions have been carefully perused.\n\n5. The controversy before us is regarding the vires of section 3A of\nthe Act of 2005 and the Notification. The Notification was challenged\nbefore the Lahore High Court without questioning the vires of section\n3A of the Act of 2005. The grievance was solely confined to the legality\nof the Notification. The High Court had dismissed the petitions and\nleave was refused by this Court. This Court had observed that since the\ndemand for recovery of the special excise duty was raised after section\n3A of the Act of 2005 had taken effect, therefore, no prejudice or\ninjustice was caused to the petitioners. The judgment of the Lahore\nHigh Court attained finality and, therefore, the vires of the Notification\nstood affirmed. The order dated 18.10.2011 of this Court, whereby the\njudgment of the Lahore High Court had been upheld, was published in\n\none of the law reports.\n\n6. The petitions filed before the High Court of Sindh in 2011 were\ndecided in 2013. We have noted, and it is obvious from the impugned\njudgment that none of the parties before the High Court had brought\nthe judgment of this Court to the attention of the learned judge. It is\nalso unexplained why one of the petitions challenging the judgment of\nthe Lahore High was not fixed along with the other petitions. Moreover,\nat the leave granting stage the Bench was not informed that the\n\njudgment of the Lahore High Court had already been upheld and that\n\nCA 749/13 etc.\n\nall the petitions fixed for hearing were dismissed. As already noted, the\nquestion regarding the vires of the Notification had attained finality and\nsince this Court had upheld the judgment of the Lahore High Court,\ntherefore, it had become binding on the other courts. The Sind High\nCourt, therefore, could not have decided a matter which had attained\nfinality after it was adjudicated by this Court by upholding the\nsustainability of the vires of the Notification. Even otherwise, it was\ncorrectly observed while upholding the judgment of the Lahore High\nCourt that no prejudice nor injustice was caused because the demand\nwas raised after 01-07-2007 i.e when the insertion of section 3A had\ntaken effect. The finality attained by the judgment of the Lahore High\nCourt had a binding effect on the other High Courts to the extent of the\nlegality and vires of the Notification. The Sindh High Court could not\nhave taken a contrary view by declaring the Notification as illegal and\nthus striking it down. The Notification was, therefore, declared to be\nvalid and effective by the Lahore High Court and the judgment was\nupheld by this Court. It had attained finality and thus the judgment of\nthe Sindh High Court was not sustainable regarding the legality and\n\nvires of the Notification.\n\n7. The question regarding the vires of section 3A was challenged\nbefore the Sindh High Court in addition to the legality of the\nNotification. The vires of section 3A inserted in the Act of 2005 had not\nbeen questioned before the Lahore High Court. The High Court of Sindh\nhad struck down section 3A on the touchstone of the doctrine of\nimpermissible and excessive delegation of legislative power. Before we\nexamine whether section 3A attracted the doctrine, it would be\nbeneficial to discover the legislature’s intent in the imposition of the\nespecial excise duty there under. Section 3 provides that there shall be\n\nlevied and collected duties of excise on goods and services specified in\n\nCA 749/13 etc.\n\nclauses (a) to (e) of sub section 1 ibid. Sub section 3 empowers the\nFederal Board of Revenue to levy and collect duties subject to the\nfulfilment of the conditions expressly mentioned therein. The Federal\nGovernment has been vested with power and jurisdiction to charge, levy\nand collect a further duty at the rate of two percent of the value in\naddition to the specified rate. This power may be exercised by\nnotification in the official gazette. The legislature, in the case of excise\nduties, has empowered the Board or the Federal Government, as the\ncase may be, to levy and collect duties of excise and the conditions for\nexercising the powers have been specified. The legislature has\nmanifestly expressed its intention to levy and collect duties of excise\nand has empowered the Board or the Federal Government to give effect\nto the levy and charge by fulfilling certain conditions. Such delegation of\npower by the legislature is not an unusual phenomenon. The legislature\nmerely delegates the power to the Federal Government so as to enable it\nto work out certain details and exercise its discretion in order to achieve\nthe object of the statute. The legislature, by no stretch of the\nimagination, abdicates its power and authority expressly provided\nunder Article 77 of the Constitution. The delegation of powers under the\nrespective sub sections of section 3 to the Federal Government or the\nBoard, as the case may be, do not attract the mischief of the doctrine of\nimpermissible and excessive delegation of legislative authority nor has it\nbeen declared as such by this Court. The purpose of referring to the\ndelegation of powers to an outside authority was to show that it was not\nan unusual phenomenon. Such delegation of power to an outside entity\nhas been made in other taxation statutes as well such as the Customs\n\nAct 1969 (‘Act of 1969).\n\n8. Section 3A was inserted through the Finance Act, 2007. A plain\n\nreading of the section shows that the legislature had intended to levy a\n\nCA 749/13 etc.\n\n‘special excise duty’ on two categories; all goods produced and\nmanufactured in and goods imported into Pakistan. The Federal\nGovernment was empowered to identify and select goods or classes of\ngoods from the two aforementioned categories for the purposes of giving\neffect to the imposition of the special excise duty and such levy and\ncollection was subject to conditions, limitations or restrictions as the\nFederal Government may deem appropriate. The power was exercisable\nby the Federal Government through the issuance and publication of a\nnotification in the official gazette. The legislature had expressly fixed the\nrate of levy and collection of the special excise duty which was initially\none percent and later it was increased to two and a half percent of the\nvalue of the specified goods. The levy of the special excise duty under\nsection 3A was expressly declared by the legislature in addition to the\nduties of excise levied, charged and collected under section 3. It is\nobvious from the language of section 3 that the legislature had levied\nspecial excise duty on the two categories and goods but its collection\nwas suspended and left to the discretion of the Federal Government.\nThe rate of such levy and collection was fixed by the legislature itself.\nThe policy of the imposition of special excise duty was implicit and the\nlegislature itself had set forth the guidelines to be followed by the\ndelegated authority. By no stretch of the imagination can it be\nconstrued that the legislature had delegated the essential legislative\nfunctions to the Federal Government. The legislature had merely\ndelegated the ancillary and incidental functions to the Federal\nGovernment. The legislature had empowered the Federal Government to\ndetermine the goods for the purposes of collection of the special excise\nduty. Section 3A does not delegate unfettered power in the absence of\nstandards set out by the legislature. The legislature has prescribed\n\nintelligible guiding principles to be applied while exercising the\n\nCA 749/13 etc.\n\ndelegated authority. The question that is to be answered is; whether the\nHigh Court was justified in striking down section 3A on the touchstone\nof the doctrine of impermissible and excessive delegation of legislative\nauthority. In order to answer this question it would be beneficial to\nexamine the settled principles regarding striking down a statutory\nprovision and the relevance of the doctrine of impermissible and\n\nexcessive delegation of legislative authority.\n\n9. The Constitution is based on the seminal principle of trichotomy\nof powers. The legislature makes the laws, the executive executes it\nwhile the judicial branch is entrusted with the duty to interpret it.\nArticle 141 of the Constitution explicitly declares that, subject to the\nConstitution, the Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament) may make laws,\nincluding laws having extra-territorial operation, for the whole or any\npart of Pakistan. Likewise, a Provincial Assembly may make laws for the\nrespective province or any part thereof. Article 142 sets out the powers\nof the Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament) to make laws. Article 77 expressly\nprovides that no tax shall be levied for the purposes of the Federation\nexcept by or under the authority of an Act of the Majlis-e-Shoora\n(Parliament). The Constitution has clearly set out the limits for each\norgan of the State and crossing these limits amounts to encroaching\nupon the domain of the other and consequently breaching the\nprovisions of the supreme law. As already noted, making the law falls\nexclusively within the domain of the legislature. The judicial branch has\nno jurisdiction to promulgate laws and, therefore, stringent rules and\nprinciples have been laid down in the context of the exercise of the\npower of judicial review, relating to examining the vires of a law\npromulgated by the legislature. The foundational rule of interpretation\nis a presumption in favour of constitutionality. The burden to prove that\n\nthe promulgated law is invalid is on the person who challenges its vires.\n\n10\nCA 749/13 etc.\nBased on the said rule, this Court has enunciated the principle that law\nshould be saved rather than be destroyed and that courts must lean in\nfavour of upholding the constitutionality of legislation.2 The function of\nlegislation is the exclusive prerogative of the legislature. The wisdom of\nthe legislature to promulgate a law and to achieve a particular object\nand purpose cannot be questioned and, therefore, it is presumed that\nlaws have been legally, validly and constitutionally promulgated on the\nbasis of its competence. The courts have no jurisdiction or power to\nrewrite the laws and the Constitution. The promulgated laws or its\nprovisions cannot be struck down lightly and it is the duty of the courts\nto make every possible effort to reconcile the statute to the Constitution\nand to strike it down when it becomes impossible to do so.° The courts\nare not empowered to strike down a law or its provision on higher\nethical notions or on the basis of philosophical concepts and no mala\nfide can be attributed to the legislature. It is the duty of the courts to\ngive effect to the scheme of representative governance of the State which\nis the foundation and the edifice of the Constitution is built on it. This\nCourt has, therefore, laid down stringent and narrow grounds in the\ncontext of striking down a law or a provision while exercising the power\nof judicial review. In Ms. Imrana Tiwana's case* this Court, after\nsurveying its jurisprudence, has summarised the grounds for striking\n\ndown a law and they are as follows;\n\n(i) There is a presumption in favour of constitutionality and\na law must not be declared unconstitutional unless the\nstatute is placed next to the Constitution and no way\ncan be found in reconciling the two;\n\n(ii) Where more than one interpretation is possible, one of\nwhich would make the law valid and the other void, the\nCourt must prefer the interpretation which favours\nvalidity;\n\n? Elahi Cotton Ltd. v. Federation of Pakistan and others (PLD 1997 SC 582)\n3 pakistan Lawyers Forum and others v. Federation of Pakistan and others (PLD 2005 SC 719)\n* Lahore Development Authority and others v. Ms. Imrana Tiwana and others (2015 SCMR 1739)\n\n11\nCA 749/13 etc.\n\n(iii) A statute must never be declared unconstitutional\nunless its invalidity is beyond reasonable doubt. A\nreasonable doubt must be resolved in favour of the\nstatute being valid;\n\n(iv) If a case can be decided on other or narrower grounds,\nthe Court will abstain from deciding the constitutional\nquestion;\n\n(v) The Court will not decide a larger constitutional\nquestion than is necessary for the determination of the\ncase;\n\n(vi) The Court will not declare a statute unconstitutional on\nthe ground that it violates the spirit of the Constitution\nunless it also violates the letter of the Constitution;\n\n(vii) The Court is not concerned with the wisdom or\nprudence of the legislation but only with its\nconstitutionality;\n\n(viii) The Court will not strike down statutes on principles of\nrepublican or democratic government unless those\nprinciples are placed beyond legislative encroachment\nby the Constitution.\n\n(ix) Mala fides will not be attributed to the Legislature\n\n10. The Constitution does not expressly empower the Majilis-e-\nShoora (Parliament) to delegate certain functions to an outside agency,\nauthority or a person. However, this Court has consistently held that\ndelegation of certain powers and functions is not an unusual\nphenomenon, rather it has become necessary in the present complex\nmodern world to delegate certain functions in order to implement the\nobject of a _ statute and to work out certain details.5 But,\nsimultaneously, it is settled law that since the Majilis-e-Shoora\n(Parliament) is a creation of the Constitution, therefore, it cannot exceed\nthe boundaries expressly set out therein. The power to exercise\nlegislative authority expressly provided under the Constitution cannot\nbe abdicated by the legislature by way of delegation. The difficulty in\n\ndiscerning the exact limits within which the legislature may avail itself\n\n*Federation of Pakistan and others v. Shaukat Ali Mian and others (PLD 1999 SC 1026)\nZaibtun Textile Mills Ltd. v. Central Board of Revenue (PLD 1983 SC 358)\n\n12\nCA 749/13 etc.\nof delegating certain functions to an outside agency or authority has\nbeen recognised in the United States by the Supreme Court. Chief\nJustice Marshal, who had delivered the opinion of the Court, observed\nthat 'maker of the law may commit something to the discretion of the\nother departments, and the precise boundary of this power is a subject\nof delicate and difficult inquiry, into which a Court will not enter\n\nunnecessarily.®\n\n11. This Court, in Sirajul Haq Patwari’s case’ has cautioned that the\ndoctrine of impermissible excessive delegation of legislative power must\nbe exercised with greatest circumspection. Hamood-ur-Rehman, J., as\nhe then was, has observed that before striking down a law a great\namount of caution and care was necessary because it was bound to\nresult, of necessity, in upsetting the legislative scheme. The cardinal\nprinciple of interpretation of the law should be to interpret it in such a\nmanner that it should rather be saved than destroyed. The courts\nshould lean in favour of upholding the constitutionality of the\nlegislature and it is therefore incumbent upon the courts to be\nextremely reluctant to strike down laws as being unconstitutional. It\nwas emphasized that this power should be exercised only when\nabsolutely necessary, for injudicious exercise of this power was likely to\n\nresult in grave and serious consequences.\n\n12. It is settled law that the essential legislative functions cannot be\ndelegated beyond reasonable limits because doing so would be in\nviolation of the Constitution. The legislature, being the creation of the\nConstitution, does not inherently possess absolute legislative power but\nthe same can only be exercised in conformity with the powers granted\n\nby the Constitution. The legislature, therefore, determines the legislative\n\n5Wayman v. Southard, 23 U.S. 1 (1825)\n” The Province of East Pakistan and others v. Sirajul Haq Patwari and others (PLD 1966 SC 854)\n\n13\nCA 749/13 etc.\npolicies and sets out the principles and standards for guidance of the\ndelegated authority. The fundamental legislative responsibility,\nundoubtedly, cannot be delegated. The delegation must adhere to\ncertain constraints. The general principles set out for exercising the\npower of legislation are met by the Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament) and\nonce that has been done, the delegation of the authority is confined to\nmaking subordinate legislation or to attend to other matters of\nadministration and details. The primary functions expressly stated in\nthe Constitution have to be fulfilled by the legislature itself while the\nlatter may delegate ancillary and incidental functions to an outside\nagency or authority. This Court, in Shaukat Ali Mian’s case® has drawn\na distinction between a provision of a statute which may be ex facie\ndiscriminatory and the provisions which may be capable of pressing\ninto service in an arbitrary and illegal manner. This Court has held that\nin case of the latter eventuality, the provisions cannot be struck down\non the ground that it is capable of being used in a discriminatory\nmanner. Any action taken pursuant to powers delegated under a\nprovision will obviously be subject to the judicial review of the courts. In\nMehram Ali’s case®, a statue had empowered the government to amend\nthe schedule of the statute in order to add, modify or omit any entry by\na notification. The argument raised before this Court that it attracted\nthe doctrine of excessive delegation of legislative power and therefore it\nwas ultra vires was not found to be persuasive. It was held that the\ndelegation of such powers to the government by the legislature was not\nan unusual phenomenon. The delegation of legislative authority will be\nimpermissible and excessive when the legislature has not laid down the\npolicy of law, has failed to provide standards for guidance or when the\n\nessential legislative functions have been delegated to an outside entity\n\n8 Federation of Pakistan and others v. Shaukat Ali Mian and others (PLD 1999 SC 1026)\n° Mehran Ali and others v. Federation of Pakistan and others (PLD 1998 SC 1445)\n\n14\nCA 749/13 etc.\nin violation of the limits set out in the Constitution. As long the\nlegislature has set out procedural safeguards and has prescribed the\nstandards, the delegation cannot be construed as impermissible or\nexcessive. Moreover, the doctrine may become relevant if the delegated\nlegislative authority is unrestricted and uncontrolled. In order to strike\ndown a law on the basis of the doctrine of impermissible and excessive\ndelegation of legislative power, great care has to be exercised by the\ncourts. In case of doubt, the question of vires must be resolved in\nfavour of upholding the law and every effort must be made to sustain\nthe validity. Apprehension that the law could be abused cannot be a\n\nground for striking it down.\n\n13. We have already discussed the nature and extent of delegation\nunder section 3A of the Act of 2005. We have also carefully perused the\nreasoning of the High Court in support of striking down section 3A of\nthe Act of 2005. The reasoning is based on presumptions, rather on the\napprehension, that the power vested in the Federal Government could\nbe abused. This ground is definitely in violation of the principles\nenunciated in the context of striking down a law promulgated by the\nlegislature as highlighted above. The legislature had not abdicated its\nessential legislative functions, rather, incidental and ancillary functions\nwere delegated to the Federal Government. The doctrine of\nimpermissible excessive legislative authority was not attracted and,\ntherefore, section 3A could not have been struck down in the\n\ncircumstances.\n\n14. Lastly, whether the High Court, while allowing the petitions, was\njustified to order refund of the special excise duty which was levied and\ncollected under section 3A, the answer is in the negative. We have\nalready held the declaration by the High Court regarding striking down\n\nof section 3A not to be sustainable. The respondents were not entitled\n\n15\nCA 749/13 etc.\nto claim the refund. But assuming that a claim of refund was made out,\neven then the High Court was not competent to order the refund in\nviolation of the provisions of the Act of 2005. Section 44 of the Act of\n2005 sets out the conditions and procedure for claiming refund. It is\nnoted that duty of excise or special excise duty fall within the ambit of\nindirect taxes. The burden is transferred to the consumer. In the case of\nrefund, a competent authority has to be satisfied that the burden has\nnot been transferred to the consumer before allowing the claim. This\nbecomes crucial in order to ensure that the claimant is not unjustly\nenriched. The claimant will not be entitled to refund if the latter fails to\ndischarge the onus that the burden of duty was not transferred to the\nconsumer. The High Court was, therefore, not justified nor competent to\norder the refund of the special excise duty collected under section 3A of\nthe Act of 2005 despite having struck down the said provision. Even in\nsuch an eventuality the only remedy available to a claimant would have\n\nbeen to file an application for refund under the Act of 2005.\n\n15. For the reasons stated above, we allow the appeals, except CA-\n749/2013 and, accordingly, set aside the impugned judgments dated\n22.2.2013, 23.12.2013, 11.8.2015, 02.10.2017 and 25.10.2018 of the\nHigh Court of Sindh. CA-749/2013 stands dismissed and,\nconsequently, the impugned judgment of the Lahore High Court dated\n\n27.6.2011 is hereby upheld.\n\nI am in respectful agreement with this clearly\nexpounded judgment, except for a couple of\nsentences in paragraph 6, and shall add my\nseparate note.\nSd/-\nChief Justice\n\nIagree with the note of\nHon’ble Chief Justice\nSd/-\nJudge\n\nSd/-\n\n16\nCA 749/13 etc.\n\nJudge\nAnnounced in open Court on this 25th day of July 2024\nat Islamabad\n\nSd/-\nJudge\nAPPROVED FOR REPORTING\n\n(Aamir Sheikh/ Rameen Moin, LC)\n\n\nQazi Faez Isa, CJ.\n\n1. I have had the pleasure of reading the clearly expounded\njudgment written by my distinguished colleague Hon’ble Justice\nAthar Minallah and with the exception of two sentences in\nparagraph six (6) I am in respectful agreement therewith. Removing\nthese sentences from the judgment does not affect the outcome of\nthe decision. However, since these two sentences may be\n\nused/misused in some other case, they need to be attended to.\n\n2. The portion of paragraph 6, where the said two sentences\nreside, is reproduced below, and for identification the said\nsentences are highlighted:\n\nThe finality attained by the judgment of the\nLahore High Court had a binding effect on the\nother High Courts to the extent of the legality and\nvires of the Notification. The Sindh High Court\ncould not have taken a contrary view by declaring\nthe Notification as illegal and thus striking it\ndown. The Notification was, therefore, declared to be\nvalid and effective by the Lahore High Court and the\njudgment was upheld by this Court. It had attained\nfinality and thus the judgment of the Sindh High Court\nwas not sustainable regarding the legality and vires of\nthe Notification.\n\nWith respect I cannot bring myself to agree with the\n\naforesaid highlighted sentences.\n\n3. Article 201 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of\nPakistan (the Constitution), reproduced hereunder, stipulates\nthat a High Court’s decision is binding on all courts subordinate to\nit:\n‘201. Subject to Article 189, any decision of a High\nCourt shall, to the extent that it decides a question of law\n\nor is based upon or enunciates a principle of law, be\nbinding on all courts subordinate to it.’\n\n4. Article 201 does not state that a High Court’s decision is\nbinding on other High Courts too. On the other hand Article 189 of\nthe Constitution, reproduced hereunder, stipulates that the\ndecisions of the Supreme Court are binding on all other courts,\nwhich would include all High Courts, but not the Supreme Court\n\nitself since the word other is used in Article 189.\n\nCA No. 749/2013, etc. 2\n\n‘189. Any decision of the Supreme Court shall, to the\nextent that it decides a question of law or is based upon\nor enunciates a principle of law, be binding on all other\ncourts in Pakistan.’\n\nReference in this regard may also be made to the case of\n\nHussain Raza v Lahore High Court.!\n\n5. Article 201 commences with the words Subject to Article 189\nwhich removes all doubts (if at all there could be any) that the\ndecisions of the High Court are only binding on all courts\nsubordinate to it, which are those within its territorial jurisdiction.\nTherefore, while a decision of a High Court is persuasive and may\nbe followed by another High Court it is not binding on it, and\nanother High Court may make a different decision. This also\naccords with the very first Article of the Constitution which states\nthat ‘Pakistan shall be Federal Republic’ and mentions the\n‘territories of Pakistan’. The High Court of each federating unit is\nindependent, and a fortiori that it acts independently. Their\nindependence can only be curtailed to the extent that the\nConstitution itself may do so. There is no constitutional provision\nwhich supports the said two sentences, on the contrary Article 201\nof the Constitution states the opposite, which is iterated by its\nArticle 189.\n\n6. Law and good practice also requires that judgments be\nwritten soon after the hearing has concluded. This case was heard\non 6 December 2023 and, on the same day, it was marked to\nHon’ble Justice Athar Minallah for writing the judgment. The\njudgment took over six months to write, or precisely 223 days. His\nlordship sent the judgment to me on 18 July 2024 and the very\nnext day on 19 July 2024 I wrote my note thereon and signed it.\n\n7. Order XX, rule 1(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (‘the\nCode’) prescribes that judgments should be written within thirty\ndays:\n\n‘The Court shall, after the case has been heard,\npronounce the judgment in open court, either at once\nor on some future day not exceeding thirty days, for\n\n1 PLD 2022 Supreme Court 7.\n\nCA No. 749/2013, etc. 3\n\nwhich due notice shall be given to the parties or their\nadvocates.’\n\nIn the case of MFMY Industries Ltd. v Federation of Pakistan?\nthis Court held that:\n\n6. ... In my view, the expression “not exceeding\nthirty days” makes it mandatory for the Trial Court to\nrender its judgment within the prescribed time period.\nIf the same is not done, without a sufficient cause i.e.\na cause beyond the control of the Judge, the judgment\nis impaired in value if not invalid and disciplinary\naction can be taken against a Judge who is found\nhabitual in delaying his judgments beyond that period,\nobviously following proper legal steps for such action\nand in any case at least this vice of the judge must\nadversely reflect in his ACR’s.\n\n8. However, in the case of an appeal against the judgment and\ndecree of a trial court, the relevant provision is Order XLI, rule 30,\n\nof the Code, which states that:\n\n‘The Appellate Court after hearing the parties or their\npleaders and referring to any part of the proceedings\nwhether on appeal or in the Court from whose decree\nthe appeal is preferred to which reference maybe\nconsidered necessary, shall pronounce judgment in\nopen Court, either at once or on some future day of\nwhich notice shall be given to the parties or their\npleaders.’\n\nIn the cited precedent of MFMY Industries Ltd. v Federation of\nPakistan Order XLI, rule 30 of the Code was considered and the\ntime that an Appellate Court may take in pronouncing the\n\njudgment and it was held that:\n\n‘From a reading of the above, it is conspicuous that the\nappellate Court after hearing (note: obviously the\nhearing means oral arguments) the parties or their\npleaders, as the case may be, shall pronounce the\njudgment at once or on some future day. This future\nday by no stretch of legal interpretation or on the\nsettled rules and norms of justice can be construed to\nmean an indefinite period. Rather the rule of\nreasonableness of time required for the performance\nof a judicial act in the normal and ordinary course\nnecessary for doing justice should be attracted and\npressed into service and read into it.’\n\n22015 SCMR 1550.\n\nCA No. 749/2013, etc. 4\n\n9. This Court then (in the MFMY Industries case) proceeded to\ndilate upon the maximum time that may be taken in writing a\njudgment by the High Court in its appellate, revisional and\n\nconstitutional jurisdiction:\n\n7. I shall now turn to the hearing of the first\nand/or second appeals by the High Court(s), and the\nhearing of the cases before it in its revisional and\nconstitutional jurisdiction. As the first appeals against\ndecrees and mostly the constitutional cases and ICAs\nare heard by a Division Bench(s) of the High Courts, so\nas to enable the two Judges to deliberate, confabulate\nand compose the judgment(s), or record dissent\nand/or exchange draft judgments, the reasonable time\nfor the pronouncement of judgments should be 90\ndays. This time period (90 days) shall also be\nreasonable time for the High Courts, for the reason\nthat Article 201 of the Constitution of the Islamic\nRepublic of Pakistan, 1973 mandates “Subject to\nArticle 189, any decision of a High Court shall, to the\nextent that it decides a question of law or is based upon\nor enunciates a principle of law, be binding on all courts\nsubordinate to it”. Thus for proper enunciation of law,\nconsiderable research, brooding and pondering may be\nrequired. 90 days time in view of said Article should,\ntherefore, also be good and adequate for the\ncomposition of the judgments by the High Court(s) in\nthe above matters and also in first appeal against\norder or second appeals, and in the cases before it in\nits revisional or review jurisdiction, or any of the\nspecial jurisdictions of the High Court(s) (note: subject\nto the principle if the law has fixed a time for the\nconclusion of the proceedings and pronouncement of\njudgment under any special law, this has to take\nprecedence over the 90 days).’\n\n10. The Supreme Court went on to consider the maximum time\nthat the Judges of this Court may take in rendering a judgment, as\nunder:\n8. Now coming to the judgments to be rendered by\nthe apex Court of the country. The cases/matters by\nthis Court are heard in benches. Usual cases are\nheard by a three member bench, though two member\nbenches also hear the matters. The rule of 90 days\nshould also ordinarily extend to those (cases) heard by\ntwo member benches of this Court ...’\nThis was followed by a discussion of cases by larger benches\n\nwhere a draft may be circulated for discussion or Judges are of\n\ndifferent opinions, which may take up more time.\n\nCA No. 749/2013, etc. 5\n\n11. In the MFMY Industries case the Supreme Court also\n\nreminded Judges of their responsibility:\n\n‘... the judges of the superior courts cannot be said to\nbe unaware or unmindful about their responsibility of\nproviding speedy justice and the expediency of\ndispensation of the justice. And of course the mandate\nof Article X of the Judges Code of Conduct, which they\nhave sworn (vide their oath) to follow and abide by in\nletter and spirit. And the said Article stipulates:-\n\n“In this [sic.] judicial work a Judge shall take\nall steps to decide cases within the shortest\ntime, controlling effectively efforts made to\nprevent early disposal of cases and make\nevery endeavor to minimize suffering of\nlitigants by deciding cases expeditiously\nthrough proper written judgments. A Judge\nwho is unmindful or indifferent towards this\naspect of his duty is not faithful to his work,\nwhich is a grave fault.”\n\n12. Attention was also drawn to another crucially important\n\naspect:\n\n9. ... if there is an inordinate delay in pronouncement\nof judgment after hearing of the matter, especially on\naccount of lapse of considerable and reasonable time,\nsuch as six months and beyond, the Judges shall not\nbe in a position to exactly recall and record with\nprecision and exactitude as to what propositions of law\nand facts were argued before them. This shall have\nreflection upon the rule of audi alteram partem, which\nis a fundamental and salutary rule of justice and\npostulates that if someone has been denied\nappropriate opportunity of hearing in a case, any\nverdict/decision given against such person/party shall\nnot be laudable.’\n\n13. No exception can be taken to what this Court had stated,\nalmost a decade ago, in the MFMY Industries case. It would be\nmost regrettable if the Supreme Court tells other courts to decide\ncases within a particular time-frame but does not do so itself.\nFairness and the fundamental right and equality principle\n\nembedded in Article 25(1) of the Constitution can not countenance\n\nthis.\n\n14. If I, as the Chief Justice of Pakistan, do not remind my\ndistinguished colleagues of the aforesaid matters and implore them\n\nto decide cases expeditiously I will be shirking my responsibility.\n\nCA No. 749/2013, etc. 6\n\nUnlike other institutions and all those who are in the service of\nPakistan, Judges are accountable to themselves, therefore, they\nmust be beyond reproach in their work ethic. The credibility of an\ninstitution on which a substantial amount is spent from the public\nexchequer and in which hundreds are employed, must not be\nallowed to be undermined. We must assiduously and diligently\n\nstrive to decide cases.\n\n15. An indispensable component of dispensing justice is to\ndeliver judgments within a reasonable time. ‘To no one will we\nrefuse or delay, right or justice’? may be the first articulation of the\noft quoted legal maxim - ‘justice delayed is justice denied.’ This\nmaxim has for hundreds of years been used in various forms, all of\nwhich signify the same thing. ‘Swift justice is the sweetest.’* ‘To\ndelay Justice is Injustice’.® ‘If we be just men, we should go forward\nin the name of truth and right, and bear this in mind, that when the\ncase is ripe and the hour has come - justice delayed is justice\ndenied.” ‘Delay will drain even a just judgment of its value.”\n\n‘Justice too long delayed is justice denied.’8\n\n16. The guiding light of the truth of this maxim is earlier found\nin the Holy Qur’an® - ‘Allah wants no injustice in the world’!® and\n‘We created a community which guides by truth and by it\nestablishes justice.’!! Undoubtedly, inspired by the Holy Qur’an the\nMuslim world’s first Chief Justice gave the following advice to\njudges: ‘The appointed time [of death] comes much earlier than what\nyou think; hence, do the work expeditiously before the appointed\ntime comes. Those who have been given a responsibility are\naccountable to their Lord.’!? Justice delayed, being tantamount to\n\nthe denial of justice, is also a hollowed principle of policy\n\n3 Magna Carta, 1215, clause 40.\n\n4 Fancis Bacon, Lord Chancellor of England, 1617.\n\n5 William Peny, 1693, Some Fruits of Solitude.\n\n6 William Ewart Gladstone, 1868, British Parliament.\n\n7 Warren E.

The petitions were converted into appeals pursuant to grant of leave vide order dated 27-06-2013. 2. All the appeals, except one, have arisen from the judgment of the High Court of Sindh, dated 22-02-2013, while the latter assails the consolidated judgment passed by the Lahore High Court. The constitutional petitions filed before the High Court of Sindh were allowed and the department has challenged the consolidated judgment, while the petitions filed before the Lahore High Court were dismissed. CA 749/13 etc. As will be explained later, the consolidated judgment of the Lahore High Court was upheld by this Court and thus it has attained finality. 3. The dispute was regarding the vires of section 3A of the Federal Excise Act 2005 Act of 2005 and the notification issued by the Federal Government in exercise of powers conferred there under. A Bill was introduced in the National Assembly of the Majlis-e-Shoora Parliament and it was passed on 22.6.2007. The object was to amend the Act of 2005 by inserting of a new provision i.e. section 3A. It received the assent of the President on 30-06-2007. The Finance Act 2007 was thereafter published in the official gazette and the insertion of section 3A took effect on 01-07-2007. Section 3A, which was inserted through the Finance Act 2007, had empowered the Federal Government to levy and collect, subject to such conditions, limitations or restrictions as it may deem fit to impose, special excise duty on goods produced or manufactured in Pakistan and goods imported into Pakistan. The exercise of this power was through the publication of a notification in the official gazette. The legislature had expressly fixed the rate of the levy and collection as one percent of the value of the specified goods. Subsequently, the rate was increased to two and half percent of the value through the Federal Excise Amendment Ordinance, 2011. It is noted that section 3A was omitted through the Finance Act 2011 which was assented on 29.06.2011. The Federal Government had issued a notification i.e. S.R.O. 655 I /2007, dated 29.6.2007 Notification , specifying the goods for the purposes of levy and collection of the special excise duty under section 3A of the Act of 2005. It was explicitly stated in the notification that it shall take effect on 01.07.2007. The Notification was assailed before the Lahore High Court by several aggrieved persons but they had not questioned the vires of section 3A of the Act of 2005. The petitions were dismissed by a Single Judge vide CA 749/13 etc. judgment dated 30.5.2011 and the Intra Court Appeals heard by a Division Bench were also dismissed vide judgment dated 27.6.2011. The said judgment was assailed before this Court by seeking leave under Article 185 3 of the Constitution. A Bench, consisting of three Judges of this Court, refused to grant leave and consequently dismissed the petitions vide judgment dated 18.10.2011.1 This Court had observed that no prejudice or injustice was caused because the notification was acted upon after 01.07.2007 when insertion of section 3A had also taken effect. It is not disputed that the judgment of the Lahore High Court had attained finality. However, one of the petitions, i.e. CPLA No.1625-L of 2011, which had also assailed the consolidated judgment of the Lahore High Court, could not be fixed with the other petitions. This petition came up for hearing much later and it was converted into an appeal i.e. CA 749 of 2013, pursuant to leave having been granted vide order dated 27.6.2013. The petition was fixed and heard along with multiple petitions that had assailed the judgment of the High Court of Sindh. We have observed that the crucial fact regarding the dismissal of several petitions and upholding the judgment of the Lahore High Court by this Court was not brought to the attention of the Bench which appears to have led to grant of leave. Nonetheless, the consolidated judgment of the Lahore High Court, which had sustained the vires of the Notification, had already attained finality since leave was refused and all the petitions, except the aforementioned petition, filed under Article 185 3 of the Constitution were dismissed. The vires of section 3A and the Notification had also been assailed by aggrieved persons before the High Court of Sindh. The petitions were allowed through a consolidated judgment dated 22.02.2013 and consequently section 3A was declared void ab initio, a nullity in law and Shakarganj Sugar Mills and others v. Government of Pakistan and others PTCL 2012 CL 604 CA 749/13 etc. of no legal effect. The Notification was likewise declared a nullity and of no legal effect. The High Court had held that section 3A, inserted in the Act of 2005, was hit by the doctrine of impermissible and excessive delegation of legislative power to the delegatee i.e. Federal Government and therefore, it was struck down on this sole ground. 4. We have heard the learned counsels for the parties at great length and their written submissions have been carefully perused. 5. The controversy before us is regarding the vires of section 3A of the Act of 2005 and the Notification. The Notification was challenged before the Lahore High Court without questioning the vires of section 3A of the Act of 2005. The grievance was solely confined to the legality of the Notification. The High Court had dismissed the petitions and leave was refused by this Court. This Court had observed that since the demand for recovery of the special excise duty was raised after section 3A of the Act of 2005 had taken effect, therefore, no prejudice or injustice was caused to the petitioners. The judgment of the Lahore High Court attained finality and, therefore, the vires of the Notification stood affirmed. The order dated 18.10.2011 of this Court, whereby the judgment of the Lahore High Court had been upheld, was published in one of the law reports. 6. The petitions filed before the High Court of Sindh in 2011 were decided in 2013. We have noted, and it is obvious from the impugned judgment that none of the parties before the High Court had brought the judgment of this Court to the attention of the learned judge. It is also unexplained why one of the petitions challenging the judgment of the Lahore High was not fixed along with the other petitions. Moreover, at the leave granting stage the Bench was not informed that the judgment of the Lahore High Court had already been upheld and that CA 749/13 etc. all the petitions fixed for hearing were dismissed. As already noted, the question regarding the vires of the Notification had attained finality and since this Court had upheld the judgment of the Lahore High Court, therefore, it had become binding on the other courts. The Sind High Court, therefore, could not have decided a matter which had attained finality after it was adjudicated by this Court by upholding the sustainability of the vires of the Notification. Even otherwise, it was correctly observed while upholding the judgment of the Lahore High Court that no prejudice nor injustice was caused because the demand was raised after 01-07-2007 i.e when the insertion of section 3A had taken effect. The finality attained by the judgment of the Lahore High Court had a binding effect on the other High Courts to the extent of the legality and vires of the Notification. The Sindh High Court could not have taken a contrary view by declaring the Notification as illegal and thus striking it down. The Notification was, therefore, declared to be valid and effective by the Lahore High Court and the judgment was upheld by this Court. It had attained finality and thus the judgment of the Sindh High Court was not sustainable regarding the legality and vires of the Notification. 7. The question regarding the vires of section 3A was challenged before the Sindh High Court in addition to the legality of the Notification. The vires of section 3A inserted in the Act of 2005 had not been questioned before the Lahore High Court. The High Court of Sindh had struck down section 3A on the touchstone of the doctrine of impermissible and excessive delegation of legislative power. Before we examine whether section 3A attracted the doctrine, it would be beneficial to discover the legislature s intent in the imposition of the especial excise duty there under. Section 3 provides that there shall be levied and collected duties of excise on goods and services specified in CA 749/13 etc. clauses a to e of sub section 1 ibid. Sub section 3 empowers the Federal Board of Revenue to levy and collect duties subject to the fulfilment of the conditions expressly mentioned therein. The Federal Government has been vested with power and jurisdiction to charge, levy and collect a further duty at the rate of two percent of the value in addition to the specified rate. This power may be exercised by notification in the official gazette. The legislature, in the case of excise duties, has empowered the Board or the Federal Government, as the case may be, to levy and collect duties of excise and the conditions for exercising the powers have been specified. The legislature has manifestly expressed its intention to levy and collect duties of excise and has empowered the Board or the Federal Government to give effect to the levy and charge by fulfilling certain conditions. Such delegation of power by the legislature is not an unusual phenomenon. The legislature merely delegates the power to the Federal Government so as to enable it to work out certain details and exercise its discretion in order to achieve the object of the statute. The legislature, by no stretch of the imagination, abdicates its power and authority expressly provided under Article 77 of the Constitution. The delegation of powers under the respective sub sections of section 3 to the Federal Government or the Board, as the case may be, do not attract the mischief of the doctrine of impermissible and excessive delegation of legislative authority nor has it been declared as such by this Court. The purpose of referring to the delegation of powers to an outside authority was to show that it was not an unusual phenomenon. Such delegation of power to an outside entity has been made in other taxation statutes as well such as the Customs Act 1969 Act of 1969 . 8. Section 3A was inserted through the Finance Act, 2007. A plain reading of the section shows that the legislature had intended to levy a CA 749/13 etc. special excise duty on two categories; all goods produced and manufactured in and goods imported into Pakistan. The Federal Government was empowered to identify and select goods or classes of goods from the two aforementioned categories for the purposes of giving effect to the imposition of the special excise duty and such levy and collection was subject to conditions, limitations or restrictions as the Federal Government may deem appropriate. The power was exercisable by the Federal Government through the issuance and publication of a notification in the official gazette. The legislature had expressly fixed the rate of levy and collection of the special excise duty which was initially one percent and later it was increased to two and a half percent of the value of the specified goods. The levy of the special excise duty under section 3A was expressly declared by the legislature in addition to the duties of excise levied, charged and collected under section 3. It is obvious from the language of section 3 that the legislature had levied special excise duty on the two categories and goods but its collection was suspended and left to the discretion of the Federal Government. The rate of such levy and collection was fixed by the legislature itself. The policy of the imposition of special excise duty was implicit and the legislature itself had set forth the guidelines to be followed by the delegated authority. By no stretch of the imagination can it be construed that the legislature had delegated the essential legislative functions to the Federal Government. The legislature had merely delegated the ancillary and incidental functions to the Federal Government. The legislature had empowered the Federal Government to determine the goods for the purposes of collection of the special excise duty. Section 3A does not delegate unfettered power in the absence of standards set out by the legislature. The legislature has prescribed intelligible guiding principles to be applied while exercising the CA 749/13 etc. delegated authority. The question that is to be answered is; whether the High Court was justified in striking down section 3A on the touchstone of the doctrine of impermissible and excessive delegation of legislative authority. In order to answer this question it would be beneficial to examine the settled principles regarding striking down a statutory provision and the relevance of the doctrine of impermissible and excessive delegation of legislative authority. 9. The Constitution is based on the seminal principle of trichotomy of powers. The legislature makes the laws, the executive executes it while the judicial branch is entrusted with the duty to interpret it. Article 141 of the Constitution explicitly declares that, subject to the Constitution, the Majlis-e-Shoora Parliament may make laws, including laws having extra-territorial operation, for the whole or any part of Pakistan. Likewise, a Provincial Assembly may make laws for the respective province or any part thereof. Article 142 sets out the powers of the Majlis-e-Shoora Parliament to make laws. Article 77 expressly provides that no tax shall be levied for the purposes of the Federation except by or under the authority of an Act of the Majlis-e-Shoora Parliament . The Constitution has clearly set out the limits for each organ of the State and crossing these limits amounts to encroaching upon the domain of the other and consequently breaching the provisions of the supreme law. As already noted, making the law falls exclusively within the domain of the legislature. The judicial branch has no jurisdiction to promulgate laws and, therefore, stringent rules and principles have been laid down in the context of the exercise of the power of judicial review, relating to examining the vires of a law promulgated by the legislature. The foundational rule of interpretation is a presumption in favour of constitutionality. The burden to prove that the promulgated law is invalid is on the person who challenges its vires. 10 CA 749/13 etc. Based on the said rule, this Court has enunciated the principle that law should be saved rather than be destroyed and that courts must lean in favour of upholding the constitutionality of legislation.2 The function of legislation is the exclusive prerogative of the legislature. The wisdom of the legislature to promulgate a law and to achieve a particular object and purpose cannot be questioned and, therefore, it is presumed that laws have been legally, validly and constitutionally promulgated on the basis of its competence. The courts have no jurisdiction or power to rewrite the laws and the Constitution. The promulgated laws or its provisions cannot be struck down lightly and it is the duty of the courts to make every possible effort to reconcile the statute to the Constitution and to strike it down when it becomes impossible to do so. The courts are not empowered to strike down a law or its provision on higher ethical notions or on the basis of philosophical concepts and no mala fide can be attributed to the legislature. It is the duty of the courts to give effect to the scheme of representative governance of the State which is the foundation and the edifice of the Constitution is built on it. This Court has, therefore, laid down stringent and narrow grounds in the context of striking down a law or a provision while exercising the power of judicial review. In Ms. Imrana Tiwana s case this Court, after surveying its jurisprudence, has summarised the grounds for striking down a law and they are as follows; i There is a presumption in favour of constitutionality and a law must not be declared unconstitutional unless the statute is placed next to the Constitution and no way can be found in reconciling the two; ii Where more than one interpretation is possible, one of which would make the law valid and the other void, the Court must prefer the interpretation which favours validity; ? Elahi Cotton Ltd. v. Federation of Pakistan and others PLD 1997 SC 582 3 pakistan Lawyers Forum and others v. Federation of Pakistan and others PLD 2005 SC 719 Lahore Development Authority and others v. Ms. Imrana Tiwana and others 2015 SCMR 1739 11 CA 749/13 etc. iii A statute must never be declared unconstitutional unless its invalidity is beyond reasonable doubt. A reasonable doubt must be resolved in favour of the statute being valid; iv If a case can be decided on other or narrower grounds, the Court will abstain from deciding the constitutional question; v The Court will not decide a larger constitutional question than is necessary for the determination of the case; vi The Court will not declare a statute unconstitutional on the ground that it violates the spirit of the Constitution unless it also violates the letter of the Constitution; vii The Court is not concerned with the wisdom or prudence of the legislation but only with its constitutionality; viii The Court will not strike down statutes on principles of republican or democratic government unless those principles are placed beyond legislative encroachment by the Constitution. ix Mala fides will not be attributed to the Legislature 10. The Constitution does not expressly empower the Majilis-eShoora Parliament to delegate certain functions to an outside agency, authority or a person. However, this Court has consistently held that delegation of certain powers and functions is not an unusual phenomenon, rather it has become necessary in the present complex modern world to delegate certain functions in order to implement the object of a statute and to work out certain details.5 But, simultaneously, it is settled law that since the Majilis-e-Shoora Parliament is a creation of the Constitution, therefore, it cannot exceed the boundaries expressly set out therein. The power to exercise legislative authority expressly provided under the Constitution cannot be abdicated by the legislature by way of delegation. The difficulty in discerning the exact limits within which the legislature may avail itself Federation of Pakistan and others v. Shaukat Ali Mian and others PLD 1999 SC 1026 Zaibtun Textile Mills Ltd. v. Central Board of Revenue PLD 1983 SC 358 12 CA 749/13 etc. of delegating certain functions to an outside agency or authority has been recognised in the United States by the Supreme Court. Chief Justice Marshal, who had delivered the opinion of the Court, observed that maker of the law may commit something to the discretion of the other departments, and the precise boundary of this power is a subject of delicate and difficult inquiry, into which a Court will not enter unnecessarily. 11. This Court, in Sirajul Haq Patwari s case has cautioned that the doctrine of impermissible excessive delegation of legislative power must be exercised with greatest circumspection. Hamood-ur-Rehman, J., as he then was, has observed that before striking down a law a great amount of caution and care was necessary because it was bound to result, of necessity, in upsetting the legislative scheme. The cardinal principle of interpretation of the law should be to interpret it in such a manner that it should rather be saved than destroyed. The courts should lean in favour of upholding the constitutionality of the legislature and it is therefore incumbent upon the courts to be extremely reluctant to strike down laws as being unconstitutional. It was emphasized that this power should be exercised only when absolutely necessary, for injudicious exercise of this power was likely to result in grave and serious consequences. 12. It is settled law that the essential legislative functions cannot be delegated beyond reasonable limits because doing so would be in violation of the Constitution. The legislature, being the creation of the Constitution, does not inherently possess absolute legislative power but the same can only be exercised in conformity with the powers granted by the Constitution. The legislature, therefore, determines the legislative 5Wayman v. Southard, 23 U.S. 1 1825 The Province of East Pakistan and others v. Sirajul Haq Patwari and others PLD 1966 SC 854 13 CA 749/13 etc. policies and sets out the principles and standards for guidance of the delegated authority. The fundamental legislative responsibility, undoubtedly, cannot be delegated. The delegation must adhere to certain constraints. The general principles set out for exercising the power of legislation are met by the Majlis-e-Shoora Parliament and once that has been done, the delegation of the authority is confined to making subordinate legislation or to attend to other matters of administration and details. The primary functions expressly stated in the Constitution have to be fulfilled by the legislature itself while the latter may delegate ancillary and incidental functions to an outside agency or authority. This Court, in Shaukat Ali Mian s case has drawn a distinction between a provision of a statute which may be ex facie discriminatory and the provisions which may be capable of pressing into service in an arbitrary and illegal manner. This Court has held that in case of the latter eventuality, the provisions cannot be struck down on the ground that it is capable of being used in a discriminatory manner. Any action taken pursuant to powers delegated under a provision will obviously be subject to the judicial review of the courts. In Mehram Ali s case , a statue had empowered the government to amend the schedule of the statute in order to add, modify or omit any entry by a notification. The argument raised before this Court that it attracted the doctrine of excessive delegation of legislative power and therefore it was ultra vires was not found to be persuasive. It was held that the delegation of such powers to the government by the legislature was not an unusual phenomenon. The delegation of legislative authority will be impermissible and excessive when the legislature has not laid down the policy of law, has failed to provide standards for guidance or when the essential legislative functions have been delegated to an outside entity 8 Federation of Pakistan and others v. Shaukat Ali Mian and others PLD 1999 SC 1026 Mehran Ali and others v. Federation of Pakistan and others PLD 1998 SC 1445 14 CA 749/13 etc. in violation of the limits set out in the Constitution. As long the legislature has set out procedural safeguards and has prescribed the standards, the delegation cannot be construed as impermissible or excessive. Moreover, the doctrine may become relevant if the delegated legislative authority is unrestricted and uncontrolled. In order to strike down a law on the basis of the doctrine of impermissible and excessive delegation of legislative power, great care has to be exercised by the courts. In case of doubt, the question of vires must be resolved in favour of upholding the law and every effort must be made to sustain the validity. Apprehension that the law could be abused cannot be a ground for striking it down. 13. We have already discussed the nature and extent of delegation under section 3A of the Act of 2005. We have also carefully perused the reasoning of the High Court in support of striking down section 3A of the Act of 2005. The reasoning is based on presumptions, rather on the apprehension, that the power vested in the Federal Government could be abused. This ground is definitely in violation of the principles enunciated in the context of striking down a law promulgated by the legislature as highlighted above. The legislature had not abdicated its essential legislative functions, rather, incidental and ancillary functions were delegated to the Federal Government. The doctrine of impermissible excessive legislative authority was not attracted and, therefore, section 3A could not have been struck down in the circumstances. 14. Lastly, whether the High Court, while allowing the petitions, was justified to order refund of the special excise duty which was levied and collected under section 3A, the answer is in the negative. We have already held the declaration by the High Court regarding striking down of section 3A not to be sustainable. The respondents were not entitled 15 CA 749/13 etc. to claim the refund. But assuming that a claim of refund was made out, even then the High Court was not competent to order the refund in violation of the provisions of the Act of 2005. Section 44 of the Act of 2005 sets out the conditions and procedure for claiming refund. It is noted that duty of excise or special excise duty fall within the ambit of indirect taxes. The burden is transferred to the consumer. In the case of refund, a competent authority has to be satisfied that the burden has not been transferred to the consumer before allowing the claim. This becomes crucial in order to ensure that the claimant is not unjustly enriched. The claimant will not be entitled to refund if the latter fails to discharge the onus that the burden of duty was not transferred to the consumer. The High Court was, therefore, not justified nor competent to order the refund of the special excise duty collected under section 3A of the Act of 2005 despite having struck down the said provision. Even in such an eventuality the only remedy available to a claimant would have been to file an application for refund under the Act of 2005. 15. For the reasons stated above, we allow the appeals, except CA749/2013 and, accordingly, set aside the impugned judgments dated 22.2.2013, 23.12.2013, 11.8.2015, 02.10.2017 and 25.10.2018 of the High Court of Sindh. CA-749/2013 stands dismissed and, consequently, the impugned judgment of the Lahore High Court dated 27.6.2011 is hereby upheld. I am in respectful agreement with this clearly expounded judgment, except for a couple of sentences in paragraph 6, and shall add my separate note. Sd/- Chief Justice Iagree with the note of Hon ble Chief Justice Sd/- Judge Sd/- 16 CA 749/13 etc. Judge Announced in open Court on this 25th day of July 2024 at Islamabad Sd/- Judge APPROVED FOR REPORTING Aamir Sheikh/ Rameen Moin, LC Qazi Faez Isa, CJ. 1. I have had the pleasure of reading the clearly expounded judgment written by my distinguished colleague Hon ble Justice Athar Minallah and with the exception of two sentences in paragraph six 6 I am in respectful agreement therewith. Removing these sentences from the judgment does not affect the outcome of the decision. However, since these two sentences may be used/misused in some other case, they need to be attended to. 2. The portion of paragraph 6, where the said two sentences reside, is reproduced below, and for identification the said sentences are highlighted: The finality attained by the judgment of the Lahore High Court had a binding effect on the other High Courts to the extent of the legality and vires of the Notification. The Sindh High Court could not have taken a contrary view by declaring the Notification as illegal and thus striking it down. The Notification was, therefore, declared to be valid and effective by the Lahore High Court and the judgment was upheld by this Court. It had attained finality and thus the judgment of the Sindh High Court was not sustainable regarding the legality and vires of the Notification. With respect I cannot bring myself to agree with the aforesaid highlighted sentences. 3. Article 201 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan the Constitution , reproduced hereunder, stipulates that a High Court s decision is binding on all courts subordinate to it: 201. Subject to Article 189, any decision of a High Court shall, to the extent that it decides a question of law or is based upon or enunciates a principle of law, be binding on all courts subordinate to it. 4. Article 201 does not state that a High Court s decision is binding on other High Courts too. On the other hand Article 189 of the Constitution, reproduced hereunder, stipulates that the decisions of the Supreme Court are binding on all other courts, which would include all High Courts, but not the Supreme Court itself since the word other is used in Article 189. CA No. 749/2013, etc. 2 189. Any decision of the Supreme Court shall, to the extent that it decides a question of law or is based upon or enunciates a principle of law, be binding on all other courts in Pakistan. Reference in this regard may also be made to the case of Hussain Raza v Lahore High Court.! 5. Article 201 commences with the words Subject to Article 189 which removes all doubts if at all there could be any that the decisions of the High Court are only binding on all courts subordinate to it, which are those within its territorial jurisdiction. Therefore, while a decision of a High Court is persuasive and may be followed by another High Court it is not binding on it, and another High Court may make a different decision. This also accords with the very first Article of the Constitution which states that Pakistan shall be Federal Republic and mentions the territories of Pakistan . The High Court of each federating unit is independent, and a fortiori that it acts independently. Their independence can only be curtailed to the extent that the Constitution itself may do so. There is no constitutional provision which supports the said two sentences, on the contrary Article 201 of the Constitution states the opposite, which is iterated by its Article 189. 6. Law and good practice also requires that judgments be written soon after the hearing has concluded. This case was heard on 6 December 2023 and, on the same day, it was marked to Hon ble Justice Athar Minallah for writing the judgment. The judgment took over six months to write, or precisely 223 days. His lordship sent the judgment to me on 18 July 2024 and the very next day on 19 July 2024 I wrote my note thereon and signed it. 7. Order XX, rule 1 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 the Code prescribes that judgments should be written within thirty days: The Court shall, after the case has been heard, pronounce the judgment in open court, either at once or on some future day not exceeding thirty days, for 1 PLD 2022 Supreme Court 7. CA No. 749/2013, etc. 3 which due notice shall be given to the parties or their advocates. In the case of MFMY Industries Ltd. v Federation of Pakistan? this Court held that: 6. ... In my view, the expression not exceeding thirty days makes it mandatory for the Trial Court to render its judgment within the prescribed time period. If the same is not done, without a sufficient cause i.e. a cause beyond the control of the Judge, the judgment is impaired in value if not invalid and disciplinary action can be taken against a Judge who is found habitual in delaying his judgments beyond that period, obviously following proper legal steps for such action and in any case at least this vice of the judge must adversely reflect in his ACR s. 8. However, in the case of an appeal against the judgment and decree of a trial court, the relevant provision is Order XLI, rule 30, of the Code, which states that: The Appellate Court after hearing the parties or their pleaders and referring to any part of the proceedings whether on appeal or in the Court from whose decree the appeal is preferred to which reference maybe considered necessary, shall pronounce judgment in open Court, either at once or on some future day of which notice shall be given to the parties or their pleaders. In the cited precedent of MFMY Industries Ltd. v Federation of Pakistan Order XLI, rule 30 of the Code was considered and the time that an Appellate Court may take in pronouncing the judgment and it was held that: From a reading of the above, it is conspicuous that the appellate Court after hearing note: obviously the hearing means oral arguments the parties or their pleaders, as the case may be, shall pronounce the judgment at once or on some future day. This future day by no stretch of legal interpretation or on the settled rules and norms of justice can be construed to mean an indefinite period. Rather the rule of reasonableness of time required for the performance of a judicial act in the normal and ordinary course necessary for doing justice should be attracted and pressed into service and read into it. 22015 SCMR 1550. CA No. 749/2013, etc. 4 9. This Court then in the MFMY Industries case proceeded to dilate upon the maximum time that may be taken in writing a judgment by the High Court in its appellate, revisional and constitutional jurisdiction: 7. I shall now turn to the hearing of the first and/or second appeals by the High Court s , and the hearing of the cases before it in its revisional and constitutional jurisdiction. As the first appeals against decrees and mostly the constitutional cases and ICAs are heard by a Division Bench s of the High Courts, so as to enable the two Judges to deliberate, confabulate and compose the judgment s , or record dissent and/or exchange draft judgments, the reasonable time for the pronouncement of judgments should be 90 days. This time period 90 days shall also be reasonable time for the High Courts, for the reason that Article 201 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 mandates Subject to Article 189, any decision of a High Court shall, to the extent that it decides a question of law or is based upon or enunciates a principle of law, be binding on all courts subordinate to it . Thus for proper enunciation of law, considerable research, brooding and pondering may be required. 90 days time in view of said Article should, therefore, also be good and adequate for the composition of the judgments by the High Court s in the above matters and also in first appeal against order or second appeals, and in the cases before it in its revisional or review jurisdiction, or any of the special jurisdictions of the High Court s note: subject to the principle if the law has fixed a time for the conclusion of the proceedings and pronouncement of judgment under any special law, this has to take precedence over the 90 days . 10. The Supreme Court went on to consider the maximum time that the Judges of this Court may take in rendering a judgment, as under: 8. Now coming to the judgments to be rendered by the apex Court of the country. The cases/matters by this Court are heard in benches. Usual cases are heard by a three member bench, though two member benches also hear the matters. The rule of 90 days should also ordinarily extend to those cases heard by two member benches of this Court ... This was followed by a discussion of cases by larger benches where a draft may be circulated for discussion or Judges are of different opinions, which may take up more time. CA No. 749/2013, etc. 5 11. In the MFMY Industries case the Supreme Court also reminded Judges of their responsibility: ... the judges of the superior courts cannot be said to be unaware or unmindful about their responsibility of providing speedy justice and the expediency of dispensation of the justice. And of course the mandate of Article X of the Judges Code of Conduct, which they have sworn vide their oath to follow and abide by in letter and spirit. And the said Article stipulates:- In this sic. judicial work a Judge shall take all steps to decide cases within the shortest time, controlling effectively efforts made to prevent early disposal of cases and make every endeavor to minimize suffering of litigants by deciding cases expeditiously through proper written judgments. A Judge who is unmindful or indifferent towards this aspect of his duty is not faithful to his work, which is a grave fault. 12. Attention was also drawn to another crucially important aspect: 9. ... if there is an inordinate delay in pronouncement of judgment after hearing of the matter, especially on account of lapse of considerable and reasonable time, such as six months and beyond, the Judges shall not be in a position to exactly recall and record with precision and exactitude as to what propositions of law and facts were argued before them. This shall have reflection upon the rule of audi alteram partem, which is a fundamental and salutary rule of justice and postulates that if someone has been denied appropriate opportunity of hearing in a case, any verdict/decision given against such person/party shall not be laudable. 13. No exception can be taken to what this Court had stated, almost a decade ago, in the MFMY Industries case. It would be most regrettable if the Supreme Court tells other courts to decide cases within a particular time-frame but does not do so itself. Fairness and the fundamental right and equality principle embedded in Article 25 1 of the Constitution can not countenance this. 14. If I, as the Chief Justice of Pakistan, do not remind my distinguished colleagues of the aforesaid matters and implore them to decide cases expeditiously I will be shirking my responsibility. CA No. 749/2013, etc. 6 Unlike other institutions and all those who are in the service of Pakistan, Judges are accountable to themselves, therefore, they must be beyond reproach in their work ethic. The credibility of an institution on which a substantial amount is spent from the public exchequer and in which hundreds are employed, must not be allowed to be undermined. We must assiduously and diligently strive to decide cases. 15. An indispensable component of dispensing justice is to deliver judgments within a reasonable time. To no one will we refuse or delay, right or justice ? may be the first articulation of the oft quoted legal maxim - justice delayed is justice denied. This maxim has for hundreds of years been used in various forms, all of which signify the same thing. Swift justice is the sweetest. To delay Justice is Injustice . If we be just men, we should go forward in the name of truth and right, and bear this in mind, that when the case is ripe and the hour has come - justice delayed is justice denied. Delay will drain even a just judgment of its value. Justice too long delayed is justice denied. 8 16. The guiding light of the truth of this maxim is earlier found in the Holy Qur an - Allah wants no injustice in the world ! and We created a community which guides by truth and by it establishes justice. !! Undoubtedly, inspired by the Holy Qur an the Muslim world s first Chief Justice gave the following advice to judges: The appointed time of death comes much earlier than what you think; hence, do the work expeditiously before the appointed time comes. Those who have been given a responsibility are accountable to their Lord. !? Justice delayed, being tantamount to the denial of justice, is also a hollowed principle of policy 3 Magna Carta, 1215, clause 40. 4 Fancis Bacon, Lord Chancellor of England, 1617. 5 William Peny, 1693, Some Fruits of Solitude. 6 William Ewart Gladstone, 1868, British Parliament. 7 Warren E.

against order or second appeals, and in the cases before it in its revisional or review jurisdiction, or any of the special jurisdictions of the High Court s note: subject to the principle if the law has fixed a time for the conclusion of the proceedings and pronouncement of judgment under any special law, this has to take precedence over the 90 days .", "The Supreme Court went on to consider the

Through this petition filed\n\nunder Article 185(3) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of\nPakistan, 1973, the petitioner/complainant has called in question\nthe legality of the judgment dated 18.11.2013 passed by the\nlearned Division Bench of the Lahore High Court, Lahore whereby\nappeal filed by respondent No.2, Farhat Riaz was allowed and\ndeath sentence awarded to him by the learned trial Court vide\njudgment dated 30.01.2009 was set aside; he was acquitted of the\ncharge of murder and the Murder Reference was answered in the\n\nnegative. It is deemed appropriate to mention here that co-accused\n\nCr.P. No.1390-L of 2013 =:Ds-\n\ncharged for the murder of Bashir Ahmad (deceased) were also\nacquitted by the learned trial Court.\n\n2. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties as\nwell as the learned Law Officer at length and have carefully\n\nscanned the material available on the record.\n\n3. Precisely facts of case as disclosed by the complainant\nMuhammad Iqbal in private complaint are that on 22.11.2005 at\nabout 11:00 am, his father Bashir Ahmad (deceased) was coming\nfrom his Dera to his house on a bicycle. When he reached Sikandar\nGadhi, all of a sudden Farhat Riaz, respondent No.2, along with six\nothers, ambushed in canal Shahpur Branch, came out and started\nruthless beating his father with the respective weapons i.e. sota,\nsarya, hockey etc. This incident was witnessed by the complainant\nand his brother Muhammad Younis (PW-2). The motive behind the\noccurrence was the pending litigation inter se the parties.\n\n4. The incident taken place on 22.11.2005 at 11:00 am\nwhich was reported to the police on the same day at about 1:30\npm. The case was lodged under Sections 324/148/149/109 PPC\nbut vide case diary No.1, offence under Section 302 PPC was\nsubstituted to Section 324 PPC. After thorough investigation, the\npolice declared respondent No.2, Farhat Riaz guilty of the charge,\nwhereas remaining accused were found innocent.\n\nBeing dissatisfied with the police investigation, the\ncomplainant filed a private complaint against all the nominated\naccused persons and the learned trial Court summoned all the\naccused persons and formal charge was framed on 25.11.2000.\nThe prosecution in its support produced as many as 11 witnesses\nand one court witness was also produced. The statements of the\n\naccused persons were also recorded under Section 342 Cr.P.C. At\n\nCr.P. No.1390-L of 2013 3 :-\n\nthe conclusion of the trial, the learned trial Court held respondent\nNo.2 Farhat Riaz guilty of the charge of murder of Bashir Ahmad\ndeceased and sentenced him to death with fine of Rs.3,00,000/-.\nHowever, the remaining accused persons were acquitted of the\ncharge by the trial Court.\n\n5. According to the prosecution story, seven persons had\nbeaten up deceased Bashir Ahmad and this incident was seen by\nPW-1, Muhammad Iqbal and PW-2, Muhammad Younis, who are\nthe sons of the deceased. No firearm was used in the scuffle,\nexcept danda sotas but strange enough, being sons they did not\n\ncome forward to rescue their father and remained as spectators.\n\n6. Five acquitted co-accused were implicated without any\nshred of evidence to commit the murder and it was for want of\nproof that they were acquitted by the trial Court thus, it appears\nthat noose was thrown much wider, implicating falsely innocent\npersons. The motive was set up by the prosecution that there was\na litigation pending inter se the parties and the deceased was\npursuing the case, however no proof was brought on the record\nthat the deceased was party to that litigation. Thus, the learned\n\nHigh Court has rightly disbelieved the motive.\n\n7. The striking feature of the case is that in the FIR\ncomplete photographic narration of the entire tragedy has been\ngiven so much so acquitted accused and the respondent were\nattributed causing specific injuries with danda sotas etc. With\nsuch degree of accuracy each and every detail of the incident was\ngiven. This doubt of reasonable nature and substance would\nstrongly suggest that the complainant and the other eye-witnesses\n\nwere not present at the spot. Beside this, ocular testimony was not\n\nCr.P. No.1390-L of 2013 4s.\n\nin line with the documentary evidence, especially the medical\nevidence. According to the opinion of Dr. Noor-ul-Ameen (PW-6) the\ndeath was caused due to collective effect of all injuries, whereas\nrespondent No.2, Farhat Riaz was attributed with sota blows. In\nhis statement under Section 342 Cr.P.C, Farhat Riaz has taken a\nplea that the deceased was injured by unknown persons and while\nbeing shifted to hospital he fell down from rikshaw and got more\ninjuries. The learned High Court has observed that the injury\nspecifically attributed to the respondent No.2 as injury No.8 on the\nbody of the deceased about which the medical officer has described\nas multiple abrasion in the area of 7 %cm X 7 % cm, this injury\n\nhas not been declared by the doctor as fatal .\n\n8. Whenever witnesses are found to have falsely deposed\nwith regard to the involvement of one co-accused then, ordinarily,\nthey cannot be relied upon qua the other co-accused unless their\ntestimony is sufficiently corroborated through strong corroboratory\nevidence, coming from unimpeachable source, is a deeply\nentrenched and cardinal principle of justice. We do not find a\nsingle iota of corroboratory evidence to substantiate the tainted\nevidence of the same set of witnesses with regard to the\ninvolvement of the respondent in the crime, hence recording\nconviction of the respondent No.2 on the same evidence was\nabsolutely unjustified. Hence, the learned High Court has rightly\nacquitted respondent No.2 and set aside the judgment of the Trial\nCourt.\n\n9. In the case reported as Ghulam_Sikandar_versus\n\nMamaraz Khan (PLD 1985 SC 11), it was held that:-\n\n“When witnesses are disbelieved qua the acquitted co-accused\nto whom same and similar role was attributed then they shall\n\nnot be relied upon with regard to the other co-accused unless\n\nCr.P. No.1390-L of 2013 a5:\n\nthey are strongly corroborated by evidence coming from\n\nindependent source.”\n\nSimilarly, in the case reported as Munawar Ali v. The State (PLD\n\n1993 SC 251), it was ordained that:-\n\n“When the eye witness compromises his integrity and makes a\nfalse statement by way of addition or improvement in his\ndeposition and on that account one or the more accused in that\ncase are acquitted, then in such situation great care and\ncaution is to be exercised in dealing with the evidence of such\nwitness for the purpose of its evaluation in respect of conviction\nof the other accused and is to be accepted only when it is\n\nsupported by independent corroboratory evidence.”\n\n10. While rendering judgment the learned High Court has\ntaken into consideration all aspects of the matter, factual as well\nas legal. Learned counsel for the petitioner has failed to point out\nany infirmity or illegality on the record which could persuade us to\ntake a view other than the High Court. Consequently, this petition\n\nlacking in merit is dismissed. Leave is declined.\n\nJudge\n\nJudge\n\nJudge\n\nIslamabad, the\n\n18t April, 2024\nApproved for reporting\nGhulam Raza/*", "CleanedText": "JUDGMENT Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, J.

The case was lodged under Sections 324/148/149/109 PPC but vide case diary No.1, offence under Section 302 PPC was substituted to Section 324 PPC. After thorough investigation, the police declared respondent No.2, Farhat Riaz guilty of the charge, whereas remaining accused were found innocent. Being dissatisfied with the police investigation, the complainant filed a private complaint against all the nominated accused persons and the learned trial Court summoned all the accused persons and formal charge was framed on 25.11.2000. The prosecution in its support produced as many as 11 witnesses and one court witness was also produced. The statements of the accused persons were also recorded under Section 342 Cr.P.C. At Cr.P. No.1390-L of 2013 3 :- the conclusion of the trial, the learned trial Court held respondent No.2 Farhat Riaz guilty of the charge of murder of Bashir Ahmad deceased and sentenced him to death with fine of Rs.3,00,000/-. However, the remaining accused persons were acquitted of the charge by the trial Court. 5. According to the prosecution story, seven persons had beaten up deceased Bashir Ahmad and this incident was seen by PW-1, Muhammad Iqbal and PW-2, Muhammad Younis, who are the sons of the deceased. No firearm was used in the scuffle, except danda sotas but strange enough, being sons they did not come forward to rescue their father and remained as spectators. 6. Five acquitted co-accused were implicated without any shred of evidence to commit the murder and it was for want of proof that they were acquitted by the trial Court thus, it appears that noose was thrown much wider, implicating falsely innocent persons. The motive was set up by the prosecution that there was a litigation pending inter se the parties and the deceased was pursuing the case, however no proof was brought on the record that the deceased was party to that litigation. Thus, the learned High Court has rightly disbelieved the motive. 7. The striking feature of the case is that in the FIR complete photographic narration of the entire tragedy has been given so much so acquitted accused and the respondent were attributed causing specific injuries with danda sotas etc. With such degree of accuracy each and every detail of the incident was given. This doubt of reasonable nature and substance would strongly suggest that the complainant and the other eye-witnesses were not present at the spot. Beside this, ocular testimony was not Cr.P. No.1390-L of 2013 4s. in line with the documentary evidence, especially the medical evidence. According to the opinion of Dr. Noor-ul-Ameen PW-6 the death was caused due to collective effect of all injuries, whereas respondent No.2, Farhat Riaz was attributed with sota blows. In his statement under Section 342 Cr.P.C, Farhat Riaz has taken a plea that the deceased was injured by unknown persons and while being shifted to hospital he fell down from rikshaw and got more injuries. The learned High Court has observed that the injury specifically attributed to the respondent No.2 as injury No.8 on the body of the deceased about which the medical officer has described as multiple abrasion in the area of 7 cm X 7 cm, this injury has not been declared by the doctor as fatal . 8. Whenever witnesses are found to have falsely deposed with regard to the involvement of one co-accused then, ordinarily, they cannot be relied upon qua the other co-accused unless their testimony is sufficiently corroborated through strong corroboratory evidence, coming from unimpeachable source, is a deeply entrenched and cardinal principle of justice. We do not find a single iota of corroboratory evidence to substantiate the tainted evidence of the same set of witnesses with regard to the involvement of the respondent in the crime, hence recording conviction of the respondent No.2 on the same evidence was absolutely unjustified. Hence, the learned High Court has rightly acquitted respondent No.2 and set aside the judgment of the Trial Court. 9. In the case reported as Ghulam Sikandar versus Mamaraz Khan PLD 1985 SC 11 , it was held that:- When witnesses are disbelieved qua the acquitted co-accused to whom same and similar role was attributed then they shall not be relied upon with regard to the other co-accused unless Cr.P. No.1390-L of 2013 a5: they are strongly corroborated by evidence coming from independent source. Similarly, in the case reported as Munawar Ali v. The State PLD 1993 SC 251 , it was ordained that:- When the eye witness compromises his integrity and makes a false statement by way of addition or improvement in his deposition and on that account one or the more accused in that case are acquitted, then in such situation great care and caution is to be exercised in dealing with the evidence of such witness for the purpose of its evaluation in respect of conviction of the other accused and is to be accepted only when it is supported by independent corroboratory evidence. 10. While rendering judgment the learned High Court has taken into consideration all aspects of the matter, factual as well as legal. Learned counsel for the petitioner has failed to point out any infirmity or illegality on the record which could persuade us to take a view other than the High Court.

Appeal No.613 of 2009 along with MR No.193 of 2009]\n\nMuhammad Ramzan ...Petitioner(s)\nVersus\nKhizar Hayat & another ...Respondent(s)\nFor the Petitioner(s) : Malik Saleem Iqbal Awan, ASC\nFor the State : Mr. Khurram Khan,\nAdditional Prosecutor General,\nPunjab\nDate of Hearing : 17.04.2024\nJUDGMENT\n\nAyesha A. Malik, J.- This Criminal Petition is directed against\njudgment dated 04.07.2013 passed by the Lahore High Court, Lahore\n(High Court) whereby the criminal appeal filed by Respondent No.1\nwas allowed by acquitting him from the charge, and the murder\nreference was answered in the negative by not confirming the death\n\nsentence.\n\n2. Facts of the case are that the Petitioner lodged FIR No.293 of\n2007 on 26.12.2007, at 8:45 AM, at Police Station Ganjial, District\nKhushab, against Respondent No.1. According to him, he along with\nhis maternal cousin, Saif Ullah (PW-8), had come to the residence of\nhis brother, Muhammad Hayat (Deceased), to borrow his camel cart.\nAt about 7:30 AM, while riding on the camel cart, all three (Petitioner,\nDeceased and PW-8) were returning to Dera Khakhanwala. At some\ndistance, the Deceased’s other brother, Fateh Khan (given-up PW) met\nthese three and tagged along with them. As per the FIR, Saif Ullah\ndescended from the camel cart to give Fateh Khan company. The\nPetitioner and Deceased were on the camel cart, whereas Saif Ullah\n\nand Fateh Khan were on foot following the said cart. When the camel\n\nCrl.P.887-L of 2013 2\n\ncart reached link road Ameer Wala near the brick kiln of one Ahmed\nSher Shahbazi, Respondent No.1, armed with a sota, emerged from the\nbushes and raised lalkara to the Deceased for allegedly destroying his\nfamily life. Respondent No.1 gave a sota blow on the Deceased’s head\nand repeated a second blow which landed on the left side of the\nDeceased’s head and then a third blow on the Deceased’s face and left\neye. Respondent No.1 then fled away from the scene of the crime.\nPetitioner, Saif Ullah and Fateh Khan statedly witnessed the\noccurrence. As per the prosecution, the alleged motive of Respondent\nNo.1 for committing the crime was that he had a suspicion that the\nDeceased had developed illicit relations with his wife, due to which,\nRespondent No.1 divorced her some two years ago. The Deceased was\nrushed to the Civil Hospital, Quaidabad, where he was given\n\ntreatment, but he succumbed to the injuries.\n\n3. Respondent No.1 was arrested on 30.12.2007, which led to the\nrecovery of the sota (P-6) on 01.01.2008. After completion of the\ninvestigation, the trial was conducted against Respondent No.1 before\nthe Additional Sessions Judge, Khushab. Upon conclusion of the trial,\nthe court, vide judgment dated 28.04.2009, convicted Respondent\nNo.1 under Section 302(b) of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 and\nsentenced him to death as tazir. Respondent No.1 was also directed to\npay Rs.100,000/- as compensation under Section 544-A of the\nCriminal Procedure Code, 1898 to the legal heirs of the deceased or\nundergo six months of simple imprisonment in the event of default.\nRespondent No.1 appealed his conviction and sentence before the High\nCourt, which was allowed, and he was acquitted vide the Impugned\n\nJudgment.\n\n4. Counsel for the Petitioner contends that it is a case of misreading\nand non-reading of evidence as there was no occasion for the High\nCourt to acquit Respondent No.1, who was solely charged by the\nprosecution for murdering the Deceased. He further contended that\nthe occurrence took place in broad daylight, so there was no chance of\nmistaken identity. Petitioner’s counsel argued that the prosecution has\nestablished the case against Respondent No.1 beyond a reasonable\ndoubt with the assistance of truthful witnesses who have fully justified\n\ntheir presence at the spot. According to him, the contradictions pointed\n\nCrl.P.887-L of 2013 3\n\nout by the High Court are minor in nature, the same cannot be taken\ninto account by brushing aside the confidence-inspiring evidence.\nHence, Petitioner’s counsel concluded that the High Court has taken\nan incorrect view, which calls for interference by this Court in order to\n\navoid a miscarriage of justice.\n\n5. We have heard the Petitioner’s counsel and the Additional\n\nProsecutor General, Punjab, and re-examined the record.\n\n6. The High Court acquitted Respondent No.1 on the following\ngrounds:\n\nFirstly, the PWs were closely related to the Deceased being\nhis brother and cousin;\n\nSecondly, the prosecution failed to explain the delay of 8\nhours in conducting the post-mortem examination of the\nDeceased;\n\nThirdly, Dr. Khalid Bashir Awan (PW-6), who conducted the\npost-mortem examination at the DHQ Hospital Khushab at\nJauharabad, did not find any signs of initial treatment or\nstitched wounds on the Deceased by the Civil Hospital,\nQuaidabad, which belies the stance of the PWs that they first\ntook the Deceased to the Civil Hospital;\n\nFourthly, in the presence of three close relatives, Respondent\nNo.1, armed with sota only, managed to kill the Deceased\nwhile the witnesses just watched;\n\nFifthly, motive has not been proved by the prosecution,\nbecause Respondent No.1 had divorced his wife 2% years\nprior to the occurrence; and\n\nLastly, the prosecution failed to conduct forensic of the sota.\n\n7. The entire case of the prosecution relies on the ocular account\nfurnished by the Petitioner (PW-7) and Saif Ullah (PW-8). We have\nexamined the ocular account. The Petitioner (PW-7) is the real brother\nof the Deceased, who was allegedly sitting on the camel cart next to\nthe Deceased at the time when Respondent No.1 inflicted injuries upon\nthe Deceased. Admittedly, the Deceased was assaulted by a non-lethal\nweapon (sota); yet being his real brother, sitting beside the Deceased,\nthe Petitioner sustained no injury, nor was he able to prevent the\nassault on the Deceased. Furthermore, in his evidence, the Petitioner\nhas not disclosed the purpose of borrowing the camel cart from the\nDeceased, and why he was with him at that time. He also stated that\nthe camel cart was not present when the Investigating Officer (IO)\n\nvisited the place of occurrence; rather the said cart was produced\n\nCrl.P.887-L of 2013 4\n\nbefore the IO at the Civil Hospital, Quaidabad. However, as per the\nstatement of the IO (PW-9), the camel cart was standing on the road\nand was at a distance of 3 to 4 paces from the place of occurrence.\nThis is a serious contradiction in the evidence. Another contradiction\nis that the Petitioner (PW-7) described the size of the sota as 3 to 4 feet,\nwhereas Saif Ullah (PW-8) in his statement described the length of the\nsota as 6 feet. Further, in his examination-in-chief, the Petitioner\nstated that he along with Saif Ullah and Fateh Khan tried to catch\nRespondent No.1. However, in the cross-examination, the Petitioner\n\nadmitted as:\n\n[...] We did not try to catch the accused. We got busy in attending\nthe deceased. ... We did not make any attempt to apprehend the\naccused.\n\n8. The statement of the second witness, Saif Ullah (PW-8), also has\nmaterial contradictions. He is the maternal cousin of the Deceased. He\nis a resident of village Utra, which is situated at a distance of 2.5\nkilometres from the Dera of the Deceased and 1.5 kilometre from the\nhouse of the Petitioner. He described the date of occurrence as\n12.02.2007. Not only did he misstate the day but also the month of\nthe occurrence. He also stated that he had not mentioned in his\nstatement the time of reaching the Dera of the deceased and the mode\nof their travel whereas in his cross-examination, he admitted that they\nset out from the house after morning prayer, that too, on foot. He\nstated that they were following the camel cart at a distance of 8-10\nkarms whereas the site plan (Ex.PC) depicted this distance as 38\nkarms. He also stated that when they reached the Dera of the\nDeceased, the camel cart was already coming out therefrom. He\nadmitted that the Petitioner did not try to rescue the Deceased. He has\nstated that his hands and clothes were not stained with blood. He has\nalso stated that the other witnesses did not have blood stains on their\n\nclothes.\n\n9. The above-stated contradictions and discrepancies in the ocular\naccount of the eyewitnesses cannot be discarded. These contradictions\nhave diluted the story of the prosecution, whose case rested on the\nstatement of eyewitnesses, who all are closely related to the Deceased.\nNo one else was present at the place of occurrence. This creates doubt\n\nin their testimony, because both the Petitioner and Saif Ullah, reside\n\nCrl.P.887-L of 2013 5\n\nin different villages, that too, at a considerable distance and their joint\narrival at the Dera of the Deceased, on foot, in the early morning of the\nlast week of December remains unexplained. Therefore, their\ntestimony was rightly discarded. It is also critical to note that the\nalleged third eyewitness (Fateh Khan) was present, but the prosecution\n\ndid not produce him as a witness.\n\n10. As to the two eyewitnesses (PW-7 and PW-8), they are also\ninterested witnesses due to their close relationship with the Deceased.\nThe testimony of an interested witness should be scrutinized with care\nand caution.! Independent corroborating evidence is essential to test\nthe validity and credibility of the testimonies of interested witnesses.?\nCapital punishment cannot be given on the testimony of an interested\nwitness uncorroborated by any independent evidence.? As to the\ntestimony of interested witnesses, the rule is well-established by this\n\nCourt in the Nazir case as:\n\n[B]ut_we had _no intention of laying down an inflexible rule that\nthe statement of an interested witness (by which expression is\nmeant a witness who has a motive for falsely implicating an\naccused person) can never be accepted without corroboration.\nThere may be an interested witness whom the Court regards as\nincapable of falsely implicating an innocent person. But he will be\nan exceptional witness and, so far as an ordinary interested\nwitness is concerned, it cannot be said that it is safe to rely upon\nhis testimony in respect of every person against whom he deposes.\nIn order, therefore, to be satisfied that no innocent persons are\nbeing implicated along with the guilty the Court will in the case of\nan ordinary interested witness look for some circumstance that\ngives sufficient support to his statement so as to create that\ndegree of probability which can be made the basis of conviction.\nThis is what is meant by saying that the statement of an interested\nwitness ordinarily needs corroboration. For corroboration it is not\nnecessary that there should be the word of an independent\nwitness supporting the story put forward by an interested witness.\nCorroboration may be afforded by anything in the circumstances\nof a case which tends sufficiently to satisfy the mind of the Court\nthat the witness has spoken the truth. What circumstances will\nbe sufficient as corroboration it is not possible to lay down. But,\nas the question before the Court would be whether some innocent\nperson had not been implicated in addition to those who were\nguilty the circumstance relied upon must have a bearing on this\nquestion. In the case of an interested witness the corroboration\nneed not be of the same probative force as in the case of an\naccomplice for the two do not stand on the same footing.*\n(Underlining is ours)\n\nIn the instant matter, the ocular account of the prosecution’s\n\ninterested witnesses is not only materially contradictory but\n\n' Ali Ahmed v. the State (PLD 1962 SC 102).\n\n? Dalmir v. the State (1970 SCMR 840) and Muhammad Sharif v. Tahirur Rehman (1972 SCMR 144).\n3 Hazratullah v. the State (1969 PCr.LJ 138).\n\n4 Nazir v. The State (PLD 1962 SC 269) (Nazir).\n\nCrl.P.887-L of 2013 6\n\nuncorroborated by the available evidence.® As stated above, the\npresence of these witnesses at the crime scene is highly doubtful and\nquestionable. Hence, the conviction of Respondent No.1 cannot be\n\nbased upon this ocular account.\n\n11. Another important aspect of the prosecution’s case is the\nrecovery of the weapon (the sota). Respondent No.1 was arrested on\n30.12.2007, whereas the said weapon was recovered on 01.01.2008\nfrom his residence 6 days after the occurrence of the crime. According\nto the IO, the weapon was lying under the cot, and it was not stained\nwith blood. Admittedly, the prosecution has not placed anything on\nthe record to show whether the said weapon was sent to the forensic\nscience laboratory for examination. Hence, no significance can be\nattributed to the recovery of the sota as it was not established as the\nmurder weapon. It was the responsibility of the IO to have presented\nthe sota for forensics to establish that the blows inflicted on the\nDeceased were from the recovered sota, or if any blood or other\nevidence could have been found on the said weapon, that may have\n\nstrengthened the story of prosecution.®\n\n12. Itis essential to emphasize the importance of forensic science in\nthe criminal justice system. Forensic deals with ‘the application of\nscientific techniques to provide objective, circumstantial evidence.”\nForensic is a science ‘of interest to the legal system,’ whose objective is\nto ascertain what happened in the recent past.8 Forensic science\nmeans nothing more than the science which is used in the courts of\nlaw for the purposes of detection and prosecution of crime.? This\nscience plays a significant role in the criminal justice system by\nproviding data that can be used to assess the degree of guilt of a\nsuspect.!° In Dharam Deo Yadav, the Supreme Court of India (SCI)\nhighlights the significance of forensic sciences and how the role of the\ninvestigating agency is essential for effective and efficient prosecution\n\nin the administration of criminal justice.!!

Dharam Deo Yadav v. State of U.P. [(2014) 5 SCC 509] (Dharam Deo Yadav).\n\n\nCrl.P.887-L of 2013 7\n\nany criminal justice system to be effective, credible and reliable\nforensic evidence is an absolute must. For the purposes of our criminal\njustice system, investigating agencies have to move towards scientific\nevidence to establish a crime, and proper care and caution must be\ntaken to preserve and protect the crime scene. The tendency to rely on\noutdated investigative methods places a big question mark on the\neffectiveness of the criminal justice system. We recognize the fact that\neach case has to be investigated based on the facts, however, cases\nsuch as the instant case highlight the inadequacy of the investigation\nagency and how the role of forensic science has been downplayed if not\noverlooked. Crime scenes that are not managed well and do not rely\non science will lead to poor-quality evidence and erroneous acquittal.\n\nThe SCI in Dharam Deo Yadav has aptly held that:\n\n[25]. Crime scene has to be scientifically dealt with without any\nerror. In criminal cases, especially based _on circumstantial\nevidence, forensic science plays a pivotal role, which may assist\nin establishing the element of crime, identifying the suspect,\nascertaining the guilt or innocence of the accused. One of the\nmajor activities of the Investigating officer at the crime scene is to\nmake thorough search for potential evidence that have probative\nvalue in the crime. Investigating Officer may be guarded against\npotential contamination of physical evidence which can grow at\nthe crime scene during collection, packing and forwarding. Proper\nprecaution has to be taken to preserve evidence and also against\nany attempt to tamper with the material or causing any\ncontamination or damage. !2\n\n(Underlining is ours)\n\n13. Similarly, this Court in the Ali Haider case has emphasized the\n\nimportance of modern forensic techniques and science as follows:\n\n[4]. ... it might be useful to underline the role of science, modern\nforensic techniques and devices under our criminal justice\nsystem. For the law to serve people in this technologically\ncomplex society, courts need to understand and be open to\nscience and its principles, tools and techniques. Legal decisions\nof the courts must fall within the boundaries of scientifically\nsound knowledge. A judge and more so a trial judge, acts as a\ngatekeeper of the scientific evidence and must, therefore, enjoy a\ngood sense and understanding of science. As science grows so\nwill the forensic techniques, tools and devices; therefore, courts\nmust be open to developments in forensic science and embrace\nnew techniques and devices to resolve a dispute, provided the\nsaid technique and device is well established and widely accepted\nin the scientific community as a credible and reliable technique\nor device.

Malik, J.- This Criminal Petition is directed against judgment dated 04.07.2013 passed by the Lahore High Court, Lahore High Court whereby the criminal appeal filed by Respondent No.1 was allowed by acquitting him from the charge, and the murder reference was answered in the negative by not confirming the death sentence. 2. Facts of the case are that the Petitioner lodged FIR No.293 of 2007 on 26.12.2007, at 8:45 AM, at Police Station Ganjial, District Khushab, against Respondent No.1. According to him, he along with his maternal cousin, Saif Ullah PW-8 , had come to the residence of his brother, Muhammad Hayat Deceased , to borrow his camel cart. At about 7:30 AM, while riding on the camel cart, all three Petitioner, Deceased and PW-8 were returning to Dera Khakhanwala. At some distance, the Deceased s other brother, Fateh Khan given-up PW met these three and tagged along with them. As per the FIR, Saif Ullah descended from the camel cart to give Fateh Khan company. The Petitioner and Deceased were on the camel cart, whereas Saif Ullah and Fateh Khan were on foot following the said cart. When the camel Crl.P.887-L of 2013 2 cart reached link road Ameer Wala near the brick kiln of one Ahmed Sher Shahbazi, Respondent No.1, armed with a sota, emerged from the bushes and raised lalkara to the Deceased for allegedly destroying his family life. Respondent No.1 gave a sota blow on the Deceased s head and repeated a second blow which landed on the left side of the Deceased s head and then a third blow on the Deceased s face and left eye. Respondent No.1 then fled away from the scene of the crime. Petitioner, Saif Ullah and Fateh Khan statedly witnessed the occurrence. As per the prosecution, the alleged motive of Respondent No.1 for committing the crime was that he had a suspicion that the Deceased had developed illicit relations with his wife, due to which, Respondent No.1 divorced her some two years ago. The Deceased was rushed to the Civil Hospital, Quaidabad, where he was given treatment, but he succumbed to the injuries. 3. Respondent No.1 was arrested on 30.12.2007, which led to the recovery of the sota P-6 on 01.01.2008. After completion of the investigation, the trial was conducted against Respondent No.1 before the Additional Sessions Judge, Khushab. Upon conclusion of the trial, the court, vide judgment dated 28.04.2009, convicted Respondent No.1 under Section 302 b of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 and sentenced him to death as tazir. Respondent No.1 was also directed to pay Rs.100,000/- as compensation under Section 544-A of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 to the legal heirs of the deceased or undergo six months of simple imprisonment in the event of default. Respondent No.1 appealed his conviction and sentence before the High Court, which was allowed, and he was acquitted vide the Impugned Judgment. 4. Counsel for the Petitioner contends that it is a case of misreading and non-reading of evidence as there was no occasion for the High Court to acquit Respondent No.1, who was solely charged by the prosecution for murdering the Deceased. He further contended that the occurrence took place in broad daylight, so there was no chance of mistaken identity. Petitioner s counsel argued that the prosecution has established the case against Respondent No.1 beyond a reasonable doubt with the assistance of truthful witnesses who have fully justified their presence at the spot. According to him, the contradictions pointed Crl.P.887-L of 2013 3 out by the High Court are minor in nature, the same cannot be taken into account by brushing aside the confidence-inspiring evidence. Hence, Petitioner s counsel concluded that the High Court has taken an incorrect view, which calls for interference by this Court in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice. 5. We have heard the Petitioner s counsel and the Additional Prosecutor General, Punjab, and re-examined the record. 6. The High Court acquitted Respondent No.1 on the following grounds: Firstly, the PWs were closely related to the Deceased being his brother and cousin; Secondly, the prosecution failed to explain the delay of 8 hours in conducting the post-mortem examination of the Deceased; Thirdly, Dr. Khalid Bashir Awan PW-6 , who conducted the post-mortem examination at the DHQ Hospital Khushab at Jauharabad, did not find any signs of initial treatment or stitched wounds on the Deceased by the Civil Hospital, Quaidabad, which belies the stance of the PWs that they first took the Deceased to the Civil Hospital; Fourthly, in the presence of three close relatives, Respondent No.1, armed with sota only, managed to kill the Deceased while the witnesses just watched; Fifthly, motive has not been proved by the prosecution, because Respondent No.1 had divorced his wife 2 years prior to the occurrence; and Lastly, the prosecution failed to conduct forensic of the sota. 7. The entire case of the prosecution relies on the ocular account furnished by the Petitioner PW-7 and Saif Ullah PW-8 . We have examined the ocular account. The Petitioner PW-7 is the real brother of the Deceased, who was allegedly sitting on the camel cart next to the Deceased at the time when Respondent No.1 inflicted injuries upon the Deceased. Admittedly, the Deceased was assaulted by a non-lethal weapon sota ; yet being his real brother, sitting beside the Deceased, the Petitioner sustained no injury, nor was he able to prevent the assault on the Deceased. Furthermore, in his evidence, the Petitioner has not disclosed the purpose of borrowing the camel cart from the Deceased, and why he was with him at that time. He also stated that the camel cart was not present when the Investigating Officer IO visited the place of occurrence; rather the said cart was produced Crl.P.887-L of 2013 4 before the IO at the Civil Hospital, Quaidabad. However, as per the statement of the IO PW-9 , the camel cart was standing on the road and was at a distance of 3 to 4 paces from the place of occurrence. This is a serious contradiction in the evidence. Another contradiction is that the Petitioner PW-7 described the size of the sota as 3 to 4 feet, whereas Saif Ullah PW-8 in his statement described the length of the sota as 6 feet. Further, in his examination-in-chief, the Petitioner stated that he along with Saif Ullah and Fateh Khan tried to catch Respondent No.1. However, in the cross-examination, the Petitioner admitted as: ... We did not try to catch the accused. We got busy in attending the deceased. ... We did not make any attempt to apprehend the accused. 8. The statement of the second witness, Saif Ullah PW-8 , also has material contradictions. He is the maternal cousin of the Deceased. He is a resident of village Utra, which is situated at a distance of 2.5 kilometres from the Dera of the Deceased and 1.5 kilometre from the house of the Petitioner. He described the date of occurrence as 12.02.2007. Not only did he misstate the day but also the month of the occurrence. He also stated that he had not mentioned in his statement the time of reaching the Dera of the deceased and the mode of their travel whereas in his cross-examination, he admitted that they set out from the house after morning prayer, that too, on foot. He stated that they were following the camel cart at a distance of 8-10 karms whereas the site plan Ex.PC depicted this distance as 38 karms. He also stated that when they reached the Dera of the Deceased, the camel cart was already coming out therefrom. He admitted that the Petitioner did not try to rescue the Deceased. He has stated that his hands and clothes were not stained with blood. He has also stated that the other witnesses did not have blood stains on their clothes. 9. The above-stated contradictions and discrepancies in the ocular account of the eyewitnesses cannot be discarded. These contradictions have diluted the story of the prosecution, whose case rested on the statement of eyewitnesses, who all are closely related to the Deceased. No one else was present at the place of occurrence. This creates doubt in their testimony, because both the Petitioner and Saif Ullah, reside Crl.P.887-L of 2013 5 in different villages, that too, at a considerable distance and their joint arrival at the Dera of the Deceased, on foot, in the early morning of the last week of December remains unexplained. Therefore, their testimony was rightly discarded. It is also critical to note that the alleged third eyewitness Fateh Khan was present, but the prosecution did not produce him as a witness. 10. As to the two eyewitnesses PW-7 and PW-8 , they are also interested witnesses due to their close relationship with the Deceased. The testimony of an interested witness should be scrutinized with care and caution.! Independent corroborating evidence is essential to test the validity and credibility of the testimonies of interested witnesses.? Capital punishment cannot be given on the testimony of an interested witness uncorroborated by any independent evidence.? As to the testimony of interested witnesses, the rule is well-established by this Court in the Nazir case as: B ut we had no intention of laying down an inflexible rule that the statement of an interested witness by which expression is meant a witness who has a motive for falsely implicating an accused person can never be accepted without corroboration. There may be an interested witness whom the Court regards as incapable of falsely implicating an innocent person. But he will be an exceptional witness and, so far as an ordinary interested witness is concerned, it cannot be said that it is safe to rely upon his testimony in respect of every person against whom he deposes. In order, therefore, to be satisfied that no innocent persons are being implicated along with the guilty the Court will in the case of an ordinary interested witness look for some circumstance that gives sufficient support to his statement so as to create that degree of probability which can be made the basis of conviction. This is what is meant by saying that the statement of an interested witness ordinarily needs corroboration. For corroboration it is not necessary that there should be the word of an independent witness supporting the story put forward by an interested witness. Corroboration may be afforded by anything in the circumstances of a case which tends sufficiently to satisfy the mind of the Court that the witness has spoken the truth. What circumstances will be sufficient as corroboration it is not possible to lay down. But, as the question before the Court would be whether some innocent person had not been implicated in addition to those who were guilty the circumstance relied upon must have a bearing on this question. In the case of an interested witness the corroboration need not be of the same probative force as in the case of an accomplice for the two do not stand on the same footing. Underlining is ours In the instant matter, the ocular account of the prosecution s interested witnesses is not only materially contradictory but Ali Ahmed v. the State PLD 1962 SC 102 . ? Dalmir v. the State 1970 SCMR 840 and Muhammad Sharif v. Tahirur Rehman 1972 SCMR 144 . 3 Hazratullah v. the State 1969 PCr.LJ 138 . 4 Nazir v. The State PLD 1962 SC 269 Nazir . Crl.P.887-L of 2013 6 uncorroborated by the available evidence. As stated above, the presence of these witnesses at the crime scene is highly doubtful and questionable. Hence, the conviction of Respondent No.1 cannot be based upon this ocular account. 11. Another important aspect of the prosecution s case is the recovery of the weapon the sota . Respondent No.1 was arrested on 30.12.2007, whereas the said weapon was recovered on 01.01.2008 from his residence 6 days after the occurrence of the crime. According to the IO, the weapon was lying under the cot, and it was not stained with blood. Admittedly, the prosecution has not placed anything on the record to show whether the said weapon was sent to the forensic science laboratory for examination. Hence, no significance can be attributed to the recovery of the sota as it was not established as the murder weapon. It was the responsibility of the IO to have presented the sota for forensics to establish that the blows inflicted on the Deceased were from the recovered sota, or if any blood or other evidence could have been found on the said weapon, that may have strengthened the story of prosecution. 12. Itis essential to emphasize the importance of forensic science in the criminal justice system. Forensic deals with the application of scientific techniques to provide objective, circumstantial evidence. Forensic is a science of interest to the legal system, whose objective is to ascertain what happened in the recent past.8 Forensic science means nothing more than the science which is used in the courts of law for the purposes of detection and prosecution of crime.? This science plays a significant role in the criminal justice system by providing data that can be used to assess the degree of guilt of a suspect.! In Dharam Deo Yadav, the Supreme Court of India SCI highlights the significance of forensic sciences and how the role of the investigating agency is essential for effective and efficient prosecution in the administration of criminal justice.!! The SCI recognizes that for 5 Nur Muhammad v. Falak Sher PLD 1976 SC 607 . Chamkaur Singh v. State of Punjab 20.02.2017 - PHHC : MANU/PH/0266/2017. 7H. J.

Dharam Deo Yadav v. State of U.P. 2014 5 SCC 509 Dharam Deo Yadav . Crl.P.887-L of 2013 7 any criminal justice system to be effective, credible and reliable forensic evidence is an absolute must. For the purposes of our criminal justice system, investigating agencies have to move towards scientific evidence to establish a crime, and proper care and caution must be taken to preserve and protect the crime scene. The tendency to rely on outdated investigative methods places a big question mark on the effectiveness of the criminal justice system. We recognize the fact that each case has to be investigated based on the facts, however, cases such as the instant case highlight the inadequacy of the investigation agency and how the role of forensic science has been downplayed if not overlooked. Crime scenes that are not managed well and do not rely on science will lead to poor-quality evidence and erroneous acquittal. The SCI in Dharam Deo Yadav has aptly held that: 25 . Crime scene has to be scientifically dealt with without any error. In criminal cases, especially based on circumstantial evidence, forensic science plays a pivotal role, which may assist in establishing the element of crime, identifying the suspect, ascertaining the guilt or innocence of the accused. One of the major activities of the Investigating officer at the crime scene is to make thorough search for potential evidence that have probative value in the crime. Investigating Officer may be guarded against potential contamination of physical evidence which can grow at the crime scene during collection, packing and forwarding. Proper precaution has to be taken to preserve evidence and also against any attempt to tamper with the material or causing any contamination or damage. !2 Underlining is ours 13. Similarly, this Court in the Ali Haider case has emphasized the importance of modern forensic techniques and science as follows: 4 . ... it might be useful to underline the role of science, modern forensic techniques and devices under our criminal justice system. For the law to serve people in this technologically complex society, courts need to understand and be open to science and its principles, tools and techniques. Legal decisions of the courts must fall within the boundaries of scientifically sound knowledge. A judge and more so a trial judge, acts as a gatekeeper of the scientific evidence and must, therefore, enjoy a good sense and understanding of science. As science grows so will the forensic techniques, tools and devices; therefore, courts must be open to developments in forensic science and embrace new techniques and devices to resolve a dispute, provided the said technique and device is well established and widely accepted in the scientific community as a credible and reliable technique or device. Article 164 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 QSO is our gateway allowing modern forensic science to come into our courtrooms. !8 2 Id. 3 Ali Haider v. Jameel Hussain PLD 2021 SC 362 Ali Haider . Crl.P.887-L of 2013 8 Hence, the police force must make a concerted effort to shift its investigation techniques to include and rely on forensic science and accordingly, train specialized officers in this field. 14. In relation to the motive of the crime, the Impugned Judgment did not accept that Respondent No.1 murdered the Deceased because he suspected illicit liaison between the Deceased and his wife Mst. Meeran . The record shows that Respondent No.1 had already divorced his wife some two years ago. The prosecution has not established the motive given that there is no explanation of the delay. If he did have motive to kill the Deceased, then why didn t he do the same in the past when he had suspicions and why did he wait for the two years. Thus, we agree with the High Court s view that, in the absence of any other corroborating evidence, it does not appear to be a sound and reasonable motive as stated by the prosecution for the commission of the offense. 15. We find it necessary and compelling to reiterate that the cornerstone of the criminal justice system is the effective functionality of the investigating agency and prosecution. The principle of fair trial and due process under Article 10A of the Constitution specifically mandates this.!4 The dispensation of justice and fair adjudication require that the accused be equitably treated, investigated, and prosecuted in accordance with the law. However, we find that in the case at hand, the entire prosecution evidence is marred by inherent improbabilities and material defects, aside from concerns about the credibility of the witnesses. It is the duty of the prosecution to establish the guilt against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.

The facts and circumstances of the instant matter clearly cast a shadow of doubt on the prosecution s case, which has failed to prove the guilt of Respondent No.1 beyond reasonable doubt. 4 10A.Right to fair trial.

In the Tariq Pervez case, this Court has held that the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt not as a matter of grace and concession but as a matter of right. 17 Our concern herein is that a faulty investigative process will continuously dampen trust and confidence in the criminal justice system. Time has come for the investigation agency to recognize these inherent flaws and concerns in its methodology, and it needs to work towards specializing its investigative functions and separating the same from other police duties. 16. In light of the above, we hold that the findings rendered by the High Court do not suffer from any flaw or error, hence, the instant Criminal Petition is dismissed. Leave is refused.

These Civil Appeals with leave of the Court\n\nare directed against the judgment dated 21.02.2013 passed by the\nPeshawar High Court whereby the Writ Petition No.1124/2006 filed by\nthe respondent was allowed; the judgment dated 07.10.2013, passed\nby the Peshawar High Court whereby F.A.0O.71/2011 filed by the\nappellant was dismissed, and the judgment dated 17.01.2017 passed\nby the Lahore High Court, Multan Bench, whereby the Intra Court\nAppeals No.157 and 275/2011 filed by the appellants were dismissed.\n\n2. The precise facts of the civil appeals are as under: -\n\nI) C.A.No.1471/2013\n\nThe respondent No.1 applied for admission in M.Sc. Engineering in KPK\n(NWFP) University of Engineering and Technology, Peshawar. During\nscrutiny, it was revealed that the respondent No.1 did not possess the\npre-requisite qualification for admission in M.Sc. According to the\nUniversity Rules and Regulations, the qualification of B.Tech. (Hons.)\nwas not equivalent to B.Sc. Engineering; therefore, he was declared\nineligible for admission. The respondent No.1 filed a Writ Petition\nNo.1124/2006 in the Peshawar High Court, which was allowed vide\nimpugned Judgment dated 21.02.2013.\n\nII) C.A. Nos.53/2014\n\nThe appellant obtained a B.Tech degree from KPK University of\nEngineering & Technology, Peshawar. The respondent invited\napplications for recruitment for the post of Assistant Executive\nEngineer (BPS-17) in the Civil Engineering Department of Pakistan\nRailways, prescribing that candidates must hold a Bachelor's degree in\nCivil Engineering or an equivalent qualification. The candidature of the\nappellant was provisionally accepted and he was called upon to provide\n\nhis registration with the Pakistan Engineering Council but the\n\nCAs 1471/13 & 53/2014 &187-191/2018 3\n\nappellant failed to provide such a Registration Certificate. Hence, his\ncandidature was rejected. The appellant filed a Review Petition which\nwas dismissed on 29.06.2011; hence, he filed F.A.O.71/2011 in the\nPeshawar High Court which was also dismissed vide Judgment dated\n\n07.10.2013.\n\nIII) C.A. Nos. 187 to 191/2013\n\nThe respondents No. 1 to 4 filed Writ Petition No. 5578/10 in the\nLahore High Court with the plea that they possess the qualification of\nB.Tech. (Hons.) in Electrical (Power) Technology and are performing\nduties as Line Superintendent. On 20.05.2010, the Board of Directors\nof the appellant, convened its 66t meeting wherein an Agenda No. 9\nwas approved according to which 09 Seats were allocated to Diploma\nHolders & 03 Seats were allocated to B.Tech. (Hons.) for promotion from\nLS-I to Junior Engineer/SDO. The Writ Petition was allowed and the\ndecision of the management on Agenda No. 9 was declared without\nlawful authority. On similar notion, another Writ Petition\nNo.5040/2010 was also allowed. The appellants filed Intra Court\nAppeals No.157 and 275/2011 which were dismissed by the High Court\nvide impugned consolidated judgment dated 17.01.2017.\n\n3. Initially, the leave to appeal was granted by this Court in\nC.P.No.235-P of 2013 (C.A.1471/2013) on 05.12.2013 in the following\n\nterms: -\n\n“Petitioners' learned counsel, inter alia, contends that\nthe learned High Court did not appreciate that to\ngrant equivalence of the B.Tech Hons with B.E./B.Sc\nEngineering, it had no jurisdiction and the power fell\nin the exclusive domain of the Pakistan Engineering\nCouncil/petitioner under section 2 & 8 of the\nPakistan Engineering Council Act, 1975.\n\n2. After hearing learned counsel for the petitioner’s\nleave is granted, inter-alia, to consider the issue\n\nraised.\n\nCMA No. 411-P/2013\n\nNotice. In the meanwhile, the impugned judgment shall\nremain suspended.”\n\nBased on the aforesaid leave granting order, the leave was also granted\nin similar terms in other civil petitions which were converted into\n\nappeals and fixed together for decision.\n\n4. The learned counsel for the appellants in CA No. 1471/2013 argued\n\nthat the admission of respondent No.1 was cancelled in view of Rule\n\nCAs 1471/13 & 53/2014 &187-191/2018 4\n\n1.1 of the Post-Graduate Prospectus 2005-2006 of the University of\nEngineering & Technology, Peshawar. It was further averred that\naccording to the provisions of the Pakistan Engineering Council Act,\n1976 (“PEC Act”), the Pakistan Engineering Council (“PEC”) can only\nregister individuals who have qualified with a B.E/B.Sc. Engineering\ndegree. He further argued that the Higher Education Commission\n(“HEC”) can only determine the standing of two degrees at comparable\nlevels but there is a difference between equivalence and accreditation.\nThe former is the domain of the HEC and the latter is the mandate of\nthe PEC (appellant) for which HEC recognizes that insofar as\ninterchangeability or accreditation or authorizing the same status is\nconcerned, it is the domain of the respective regulatory/accreditation\ncouncil. In support of his contention, the learned counsel referred to\nthe judgments passed by this Court in the case of Maula Bux Shaikh\nvs. Chief Minister Sindh & others (2018 SCMR 2098), Fida Hussain\nvs. Secretary Kashmir Affairs (1996 PLC (C.S) 44) and Muhammad\nSadiq vs. University of Sindh & another (PLD 1996 Supreme Court\n182).\n\n5. In CA No. 1471/2013, Muhammad Farooq Malik, Deputy District\nOfficer (Roads) Kharian, District Gujrat, filed CMA No. 5008 2014\nunder Order (V) Rule 2(2) of the Supreme Court Rules, 1980, to be\nimpleaded as a necessary and proper party as an office bearer of the\nPakistan Diploma Engineers Federation (Regd.) and the B. Tech.\nGraduates Society (Regd.), which application was allowed. He, in-\nperson, addressed that though the controversy is regarding the\ncancellation of the admission of respondent No.1, he is only concerned\nwith the issue of equivalence. He argued that B.Tech. (Hons.)\nindividuals are agitating promotion matters in light of the judgment of\nthis Court in Suo Motu Review Petition, reported as PLD 1995 SC 701.\nDespite settling the issue, the appellant is continuously interfering in\nthe equivalence of B.Tech. (Hons.) vis-a-vis B.E/B.Sc. Engineering\nqualification. He also relied on the decision of the University Grants\nCommission (“UGC”) dated 12t February, 1998, wherein it was\ndecided that the degree of B.Tech. (Hons.) is not similar to B.E./B.Sc.\nEngineering degree but both the degrees are to be considered as two\ndistinct disciplines of knowledge in the field of Engineering and\n\nTechnology and should run parallel to each other.\n\n6. The learned Counsel for the appellant in C.A. Nos.53/2014, argued\n\nthat the degree of B.Tech. has always been considered as equivalent to\n\nCAs 1471/13 & 53/2014 &187-191/2018 5\n\nB.Sc. Engineering, thus the rejection of the candidature of the\npetitioner on the ground of B.Tech. Degree not being equivalent to\nB.Sc. Engineering was illegal. He further contended for the post of\nAssistant Executive Engineer (BPS-17) Civil Engineering, there was no\nrequirement of registration with the PEC. He also referred to the\njudgment passed by this Court in Suo Muto Review Petition No. 52 of\n1993 and argued that the PEC has no authority to oppose equivalency\nto the B.Tech. (Hons.) degree which is the function of the HEC.\n\n7. The Deputy Director, Federal Public Service Commission (FPSC),\naddressed in C.A. Nos.53/2014, that 09 posts of Assistant Executive\nEngineers in the Civil Engineering Department of Pakistan Railways\nwere advertised on receipt of requisition from the Ministry of Railway\nwith a prescribed qualification of Bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering\nor equivalent qualification. The B.Tech. (Hons.) degree in Civil\nEngineering has not been declared by the PEC as equivalent to the\nrequired qualification of Bachelor degree in Civil Engineering. A\nmeeting was convened on 19.02.2011, wherein the representative of\nthe PEC stated that \"Technology\" and \"Engineering\" are two separate\nand distinct streams, with different, distinct syllabi and programme\nobjectives. In the recent past, PEC in its 22.4 Annual General Body\nMeeting has adopted two resolutions regarding the non-equivalence of\n\nthe B.Tech. degree to the B.E. degree.\n\n8. The learned counsel for the appellant in C.A. Nos. 187 to 191/2013,\nargued that B.Tech. (Hons.) is not at par with B.Sc. Engineering\nDegree. The B.Tech. holders are not allowed registration with the PEC.\nIt was further averred that the first and second Schedule of the PEC\nAct, 1976 read with Sections 10, 11, and 16 debar B.Tech. (Hons.) to\nbe considered equivalent to B.Sc. Professional Engineers as both have\ndifferent characteristics and disciplines. He further argued that High\nCourt had no jurisdiction to declare B.Tech. (Hons.) equivalent or at\n\npar with a B.Sc. Professional Engineering Degree.\n\n9. The learned counsel for the respondents in C.A. Nos. 187 to\n191/2013, argued that the respondents were promoted as SDO/Junior\nEngineer-17 in 2004 and 2005 respectively. They acquired degree of\nB.Tech. (Hons.) Electrical, therefore, the issue of promotion is a matter\nbetween the employer and the employee which has nothing to do with\nthe PEC. It was further contended that the employer is free to ask for\nany qualification. It was further averred that the HEC vide letter dated\n\nCAs 1471/13 & 53/2014 &187-191/2018 6\n\n29.03.2019 decided that that both the degrees of B.E/B.Sc.\nEngineering and B.Tech. (Hons.) are two distinct disciplines of\nknowledge in the field of Engineering and Technology but should run\nparallel to each other. It was further averred that the High Court in its\njudgments rightly set aside the decision of the Board of Directors dated\n20.5.2010 of the appellant (MEPCO) wherein an Agenda No.9 was\napproved for allocating only 03 Seats to B.Tech. (Hons.) for promotion\n\nfrom LS-I to Junior Engineer/SDO.\n\n10. The learned Additional Attorney General argued that the UGC,\npredecessor of the HEC, resolved on 25.11.1981 that the B.Tech.\n(Hons.) degree, awarded by Polytechnic Institutions/Universities, be\nconsidered at par with B.Sc. Engineering degree awarded by other\nUniversities in Pakistan. However, UGC’s Equivalence Committee on\n04.01.1983 and 12.02.1998 concluded that the degree of B.Tech.\n(Hons.) is not similar to B.E/B.Sc. Engineering degree. It was further\ncontended that the National Curriculum Revision Committee (“NCRC”)\nin the year 2010 also acknowledged that both degrees are two distinct\ndisciplines of knowledge and HEC constituted a Committee of Experts\nfor recommendations on the same_ subject matter and\nrecommendations of the NCRC were placed before HEC’s Committee of\nExperts on 11.03.2014. The Committee of Experts unanimously\nendorsed the recommendations of NCRC. In support of his contention,\nhe also referred to the case of Maula Bux Shaikh, reported as 2018\nSCMR 2098. It was further argued that HEC’s mandate to determine\nequivalence under Section 10(1)(0) of the Higher Education\nCommission Ordinance, 2002 (“HEC Ordinance”) is limited to the\nextent of standing of a degree or level of education which includes the\nnumber of schooling years, credit hours gained during program, and\nrecognition of foreign degrees but HEC cannot encroach upon the\ndomain of the PEC. He also pointed out that there is a Memorandum of\nUnderstanding (“MOU”) between HEC and PEC which recognizes that\nsubstantial equivalence, authorization, and accreditation of engineering\nqualification can only be issued by the by the PEC which is responsible\nfor granting engineering professional equivalence in consultation with\nthe HEC. He referred to Sections 10 and 11 of PEC Act in support of\nhis submissions and also relied on the judgment in the case of\nMuhammad Sadiq reported as PLD 1996 Supreme Court 182 and Fida\nHussain case, reported as 1996 PLC (C.S) 44.\n\nCAs 1471/13 & 53/2014 &187-191/2018 7\n\n11. Heard the arguments. The admission of respondent No.1\n(C.A.No.1471/2013) in M.Sc. Engineering in KPK (NWFP) University of\nEngineering and Technology, Peshawar was cancelled in view of the\n“Postgraduate Prospectus 2005-2006” of the University wherein\naccording to Regulation 1.1(b), candidates seeking admission to M.Sc.\nDegree Programme must have a Bachelor’s Degree in a relevant\nEngineering discipline from an institution accredited by the PEC and\nsince the B.Tech. (Hons.) qualification was not equivalent to B.Sc.\nEngineering; therefore, he was declared ineligible for admission. In the\naffairs of admission and examination in the educational institutions,\nthe concerned authorities are vested with the powers and jurisdiction\nto lay down the eligibility criteria in their own rules, regulations, or\nprospectus. They are independent to follow their own policy for\nadmission, and in other affairs, therefore, the academic,\nadministrative, and disciplinary autonomy of a university must be\nrespected. The interference by the courts in the admission policy would\ngive rise to glitches for the said institutions to administer the matters\nharmoniously and efficiently. The educational institutions are\ncompetent to manage their own affairs without any outside intervention\nfrom executive or judicial organs unless they contravene or disregard\nthe compass of their authority or act in breach of applicable statutes or\nadmission policies as laid down in the prospectus. There is no\nambiguity in the eligibility criteria mentioned in the prospectus; hence,\nit was not open to any other interpretation. Nothing on record shows\nthat while cancelling admission of the respondent No.1, the University\ncommitted any act in violation of their rules and regulations. The\npetitioner failed to achieve the admission criteria and hence, he was\nnot entitled to admission. It was neither fair nor just or equitable to\ninterfere into affairs falling into the exclusive domain of the university\nand its academia, therefore, the learned High Court was not justified to\nintervene in the admission policy which does not seem to be\ndiscriminatory or unlawful but is a fair benchmark for applying for\nadmission in the M.Sc. Degree Programme. Reference may be made to\n\nfollowing case law:\n\n1. Noor Muhammad Khan Marwat vs. Vice Chancellor,\nGomal University (PLD 2001 219). There is another aspect\nof the case. Universities have always been considered to be\ncentres of high excellence where higher education is\nimparted and research facilities are regulated through its\nown discipline. Prominent jurists, educationists and\nresearch scholars are assigned administrative as well as\neducational and research assignments for achieving the\nobject of higher education. Such authorities, generally\n\n\nCAs 1471/13 & 53/2014 &187-191/2018 8\n\nspeaking, are competent to administer their own affairs\nwithout outside interference from executive or judicial\norgans. Unless University authorities transgress the scope\nof their authority or act in violation of the statute, Courts\nare always loath to interfere with the smooth\nadministration of universities.\n\n2. Muhammad Ilyas v. Bahauddin Zakariya University\n(2005 SCMR 961). At the outset it may be noted that as\nfar as the rules/regulations framed by the University\nAuthorities for the purpose of conductive/regularizing\nexamination etc. of University are concerned these are\nrequired to be interpreted by the University Authorities\nitself and Courts should avoid to interpret the same unless\na case of grave injustice is not made out otherwise it would\nbecome difficult for University administration to run its\ninternal affairs relating to examination, etc... therefore, no\ninterference is called for by this Court in exercise of\njurisdiction under Article 185(3) of the Constitution of\nIslamic Republic of Pakistan.\n\n3. Secretary Economic Affairs Division, Islamabad_v.\nAnwarul-Haq Ahmed (2013 SCMR 1687). The educational\ninstitutions are independent to follow policy for admission\nincluding affairs relating to changing conditions for\nendowment funds or fee, either under the policy given by\nthe government or adopted by the college; and interference\nin the policy by the Court is possible only in exceptional\ncircumstances.\n\n4. Murad Ali Khan v. Vice Chancellor, University of Health\nSciences, Lahore (2016 SCMR 134). It is a settled law that\nin matters of admission and examination in educational\ninstitutions, the University authorities concerned are the\nsole judges of the criteria laid down in the prospectus. The\nCourts in such matters desist from interfering due to the\nreason that it would create difficulties for the said\ninstitutions to run its affairs in an appropriate manner\naccording to their rules and regulations.\n\n5. Khyber Medical University and others v. Aimal Khan\nand _ others (PLD 2022 SC 92). The self-restraint by the\ncourts in matter of educational institutions is based on\nthe wisdom that academic freedom and _ institutional\nautonomy of the universities must be protected and\nsafeguarded. Academic freedom is not merely liberty from\nrestraints on thought, expression, and association in the\nuniversity, but also that the university should have the\nfreedom to make decisions about the educational matters\nincluding disciplinary matters. As it is the business of a\nuniversity to provide that atmosphere which is most\nconducive to speculation, experiment, and creation. It is\nan atmosphere in which there prevail the four essential\nfreedoms of a university; who may teach, what may be\ntaught, how it shall be taught and who may be admitted\nto study.\n\n12. The purpose of constituting the PEC under the PEC Act is to make\nprovisions for the regulation of the engineering profession and to\nregulate the engineering profession with the vision that the engineering\nprofession shall function as a key driving force for achieving rapid and\n\nsustainable growth in all national, economic, and social fields and\n\nCAs 1471/13 & 53/2014 &187-191/2018 9\n\nmaintain realistic and internationally relevant standards of\nprofessional competence and ethics for engineers, and _ license\nengineers, and engineering institutions, to competently and\nprofessionally promote and uphold the standards and the Council,\ncovering the entire spectrum of engineering disciplines, functions as an\napex body to encourage and promote the pursuit of excellence in\nengineering profession, and to regulate the quality of engineering\neducation and the practice of engineering.

While the objective of the HEC Ordinance (which repealed “The\nUniversity Grants Commission Act, 1974”) is to provide the\nestablishment of the HEC in the interest of improvement and\npromotion of higher education, research, and development. The powers\nand functions of the HEC are laid down under Section 10 of the HEC\nOrdinance for the evaluation, improvement, and promotion of higher\neducation, research, and development. Clause (0) of the aforesaid\nfunctions germane to the grant of equivalence, which is reproduced as\nunder: -\n“(o) determine the equivalence and recognition of degrees,\n\ndiplomas and certificates awarded by Institutions within the\ncountry and aboard”\n\nCAs 1471/13 & 53/2014 &187-191/2018 11\n\n15. The chronicle of events bring to light that on October 26, 1973,\npursuant to the decision of the Federal Government, the Ministry of\nEducation had issued a policy letter wherein, it was conveyed that\n“B.Tech. (Hons.) shall be treated at par with B.Sc. (Engineering)/B.E.\ndegree”. Likewise, the erstwhile UGC Equivalence Committee resolved\non 25.11.1981 in the 10 meeting of Equivalence Committee that\n“B.Tech. (Hons.) degree awarded by Polytechnic\nInstitutions/ Universities be considered at par with B.Sc. (Engg.) degree\nawarded by other Institutions/Universities in Pakistan”. However, in\nthe 11t Meeting of the erstwhile UGC’s Equivalence Committee\nconvened on 04.01.1983, it was resolved that the degree of B.Tech.\n(Hons.) be not considered as equivalent to the B.E degree but the two\nmust be considered as two distinct disciplines of knowledge in the field\nof Engineering and Technology and both streams should run parallel to\neach other. However, B.Tech. (Hons.) degree holders may be treated at\npar with B.E./B.Sc. Eng. degree holders as far as grades of pay etc. are\nconcerned but these two degrees would not be considered the same at\nany stage. Yet again on 12.02.1998, the erstwhile UGC’s Equivalence\nCommittee in its 39tt meeting, resolved that the degree of B.Tech.\n(Hons.) is not similar to B.E./B.Sc. Engineering degree. Both the\ndegrees of B.E./B.Sc. Engineering and B.Tech. (Hons.) be considered as\ntwo distinct disciplines of knowledge in the field of Engineering and\nTechnology and should run parallel to each other. However, B.Tech.\n(Hons.) may be treated at par and compatible with B.E./B.Sc.\nEngineering degree holders as far as grades, pay and promotions and\nother benefits are concerned. It was further resolved that it is up to the\nemployer to determine the type of qualification required for a particular\n\njob.\n\n16. The record further reflects that the NCRC in 2010 made the\nrecommendations that the letter issued by the HEC regarding the\nequivalency/compatibility of B.Tech. with B.Sc. Engineering must be\nwithdrawn immediately to remove any confusion, because B.Tech.\ncourses are implementation oriented and B.Sc. engineering courses are\ndesign and research oriented. The said recommendations were placed\nbefore the HEC Committee of Experts in its Meeting dated 11th March,\n2014, where the Committee unanimously endorsed the\nrecommendations of the NCRC that B.Tech. (Hons.) is not equivalent to\nB.Sc. (Eng.). Both the degrees of B.E/B.Sc. Engineering and B.Tech.\n\n(Hons.) be considered as two distinct disciplines of knowledge in the\n\nCAs 1471/13 & 53/2014 &187-191/2018 12\n\nfield of Engineering and Technology and should run parallel to each\nother. The HEC Accreditation & Equivalence Committee in its 4t®\nmeeting held on 02.12.2014, formally approved the recommendations\nof the Committee of Experts. Despite the approval of recommendations,\nthe HEC again convened a special meeting with the NCRC which was\nheld on 08.10.2015 at HEC Islamabad to revisit whether the NCRC had\nthe right to suggest a withdrawal of equivalence between B.Tech. and\nB.Sc. Engineering. The House unanimously declared that it was not the\npurview of the previous NCRC committee; therefore, degree status may\nbe continued as per Government Policy 1973. At this juncture, it is\npertinent to mention that an MOU between HEC and PEC was also\nexecuted on 15.05.2015 for developing linkages, collaboration, and\ncoordination within the entire process of accreditation for formalizing\nrespective roles. According to Article 6 of the MOU, the PEC is made\nresponsible for granting engineering professional equivalence in\nconsultation with the HEC whereas the Pakistan Qualification\nFramework (PQP) will remain in the purview of the HEC. However, on\n15.11.2019, the 8th HEC Equivalence and Accreditation Committee was\nconvened on the same subject, and the Committee, after detailed\ndeliberation decided that both degrees of B.Sc. (Engg.)/B.E.\nEngineering and B.Tech. (Hons.) are not equivalent but could be\nconsidered at par for employment, grade, promotion, etc. in their\nrespective cadre/streams. The decision of the 8» Accreditation &\nEquivalence Committee meeting was reaffirmed in the HEC’s 9th\n\nAccreditation and Equivalence Committee meeting held on 03.05.2021.\n\n17. All over again, in the 10** Accreditation and Equivalence Committee\nmeeting of HEC held on 17.11.2021, the matter was reviewed on the\nrecommendations of the Senate Standing Committee, and it was\nresolved that a Bachelor’s degree in Engineering (minimum 16 years\neducation) and a Bachelor’s degree in Technology (minimum 16 years\neducation) are at par for recruitment, pay scales and grades. However,\nvide letter dated 17.01.2022, the HEC, through its Executive Director\ncommunicated the revision of minutes of the 10 Accreditation &\nEquivalence Committee to the PEC and stated in paragraph 6 of the\naforesaid letter that the “It is further clarified that word equivalence\nhas not been mentioned in the final resolution of the aforesaid\nnotification (8.12.2021) and it is only mentioned that both the\n\nqualifications are at par for recruitment, pay scales and grades”.\n\nCAs 1471/13 & 53/2014 &187-191/2018 13\n\n18. The perusal of Section 10 of the PEC Act divulges that the\nengineering qualifications granted by engineering institutions in\nPakistan which are included in the First Schedule shall be the\naccredited engineering qualifications for the purposes of this Act and\nfor this purpose, the Council has constituted an Accreditation\nCommittee under Section 14 the same Act for organizing and carrying\nout a comprehensive program of accreditation of engineering\nuniversities, colleges and institutions etc. according to the criteria\napproved by the Governing Body in consultation with HEC. The PEC\nalso maintains a Register under Section 16 of the Act in which the\nnames and other particulars of persons possessing accredited\nengineering qualifications whose application for registration as\nregistered engineers, professional engineers, consulting engineers,\nconstructors and operators are, from time to time, granted by the PEC\nand entered in the Register. Whereas the penalties and procedure are\nprovided under Section 27 of the PEC Act and whoever undertakes any\nprofessional engineering work shall, if his name is not for the time\nbeing borne on the Register, be punishable with imprisonment for a\nterm which may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend\nto ten thousand rupees, or with both, and, in the case of a continuing\noffence, with a further fine which may extend to two hundred rupees\nfor every day after the first during which the offence continues. It is\nfurther provided that whoever willfully procures or attempts to procure\nhimself or itself to be registered under PEC Act as a registered\nengineer, professional engineer, consulting engineer, constructor or\noperator by making or producing or causing to be made or produced\nany false or fraudulent representation or declaration, either orally or in\nwriting, and any person who assists him therein shall be punishable\nwith imprisonment for a term which may extend to three months, or\nwith fine which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with both and\nwhoever falsely pretends to be registered under this Act, or not being\nregistered under this Act, uses with his name of title any words or\nletters representing that he is so registered, irrespective of whether any\nperson is actually deceived by such pretense or representation or not,\nshall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to\nthree months, or with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees, or\nwith both. Section 27 of the PEC Act further cautions that no person\nshall undertake any professional engineering work, unless he is\nregistered under this Act and no person shall, unless registered as a\n\nregistered engineer or professional engineer, hold any post in an\n\nCAs 1471/13 & 53/2014 &187-191/2018 14\n\nengineering organization where he has to perform professional\n\nengineering work.\n\n19. Last but not least, the powers of framing Regulations are provided\nunder Section 25A of the PEC Act, wherein the Governing Body may, in\nconsultation with the committee of Vice-Chancellors of the Universities\nof Engineering and Technology of Pakistan set up by the HEC, make\nregulations, not inconsistent with the provisions of the this Act and the\nbye-laws, to provide for (a) minimum standard of courses of study and\npractical training for obtaining graduate and post-graduate engineering\nqualifications to be included in the First and Second Schedules; (b)\nminimum requirement for the content and duration of courses of study\nas aforesaid; (c) minimum qualifications for admission to engineering\ninstitutions offering course of study and laying down minimum\nstandard for holding admission examinations; (d) qualification and\nexperience required of teachers for appointment in engineering\nuniversities, colleges and institutions; (e) minimum standards of\nexaminations, and duration and standard of practical training, for\nsecuring accreditation of engineering qualifications under this Act; and\n(f) qualifications and experience required of examiners for professional\nexaminations of accredited engineering qualifications. In exercise of the\npowers conferred by Section 25A of the PEC Act, the PEC framed\nRegulations for Engineering Education in Pakistan in 1985 vide\n\nS.R.0.1142(I)/85. The relevant Article is reproduced as under:-\n\n“Article 2. Minimum Qualification for Admission to Engineering\nBachelor’s Degree Programmes Offered by Engineering\nInstitutions & Universities.\n\nA candidate seeking admission in an _ Engineering\nInstitution/ University for working towards Bachelor’s Degree in\nany recognized branch of Engineering must fulfill the following\nminimum requirements:—\n\n[(ii) A candidate possessing four years degree/*qualification of\nB.Tech(Hons)/B.S/B.Sc./Bachelor of Technology (with relevant\ndiscipline) or equivalent qualification duly recognized by HEC\nseeking admission towards the relevant engineering discipline\nagainst 02% reserved seats of B.Tech\n(Hons)/B.S/B.Sc./Bachelor of Technology (with relevant\ndiscipline)], shall be considered for admission in 2021 and after;\nwith two years of exemption subject to assessment of courses\nstudied by concerned HEI for allowing maximum 40 credit hours\ntransfer_and_ satisfying PEC Regulations, and where needed\nqualifying remedial courses, shall be eligible for registration with\nthe Council as per laid down criteria: Provided that a candidate\npossessing above qualifications, enrolled against the reserved\nseats during the period January 2015 to December 2020 shall\n\n\nCAs 1471/13 & 53/2014 &187-191/2018 15\n\nbe considered for one year exemption; and Candidates\npossessing B.Tech (Pass) and B.Tech (Hons) or equivalent\nqualifications, enrolled up to 31st December, 2014 shall be\nconsidered for exemption of one and two years, respectively.\n[Emphasis supplied].\n\n*Qualification B.Tech. (Hons.)/B.S. Bachelor of Technology\nrefers to four years technology degree/program.]”\n\n20. If the B.Tech. (Hons.) is deemed to be equivalent to an engineering\nbachelor’s degree programme then there was no justification to provide\nin the aforesaid regulation that the candidate possessing a four year\ndegree/qualification of B.Tech (Hons.), B.S., B.Sc., Bachelor of\nTechnology or equivalent qualification duly recognized by the HEC\nseeking admission against 02% reserved seats of B.Tech\n(Hons.)/B.S./B.Sc./Bachelor of Technology shall be considered for\nadmission in 2021 and after, with two years of exemption. The criteria\nset down for admission is self-explanatory that both degrees are\ndistinct, with the rider that if a person who qualified B.Tech. (Hons.)\napplies for admission to Engineering Bachelor’s Degree programme\noffered by Engineering Institutions and Universities, he can avail\ncertain exemptions subject to assessment of courses and satisfying the\n\nPEC Regulations.\n\n21. The rationale of the PEC Act is to devise the provisions for\nregulation of the engineering profession and for achieving this task, the\nPEC has been constituted comprising of specialists and experts in the\nfield. The main function of the PEC is the recognition and accreditation\nof engineering qualifications for registration in accordance with the\nPEC Act. If the entire facts are seen in juxtaposition, it is clear beyond\nany shadow of doubt that the PEC persistently expressed to HEC that\nengineering and technology qualifications are two distinct streams of\nthe engineering profession and cannot be considered equivalent. Both\nqualifications are regulated internationally through their separate\naccords i.e. “Engineering Qualification” by the Washington Accord\nwhile “Engineering Technology” by the Sydney Accord. The Washington\nAccord was signed in 1989 for providing mutual mechanism for\nrecognition of graduates of accredited programme among its signatories\nwhich is a self-governing, autonomous agreement between national\norganizations (signatories) that provide external accreditation to\ntertiary educational programme that qualify their graduates for entry\ninto professional engineering practice. Pakistan is also a signatory to\n\nthis Accord and the status of the PEC has been duly acknowledged in\n\nCAs 1471/13 & 53/2014 &187-191/2018 16\n\nthe treaty. The signatories are responsible for undertaking a clearly\ndefined process of periodic peer review to ensure that the accredited\nprogrammes are substantially equivalent and their outcomes are\nconsistent with the published professional engineer graduate attribute\nexemplar. The PEC has also entered into other international\nagreements such as the International Professional Engineers\nAgreement (IPEA), and the Federation of Engineering Institutions of\nAsia and the Pacific (FEIAP). Whereas the Sydney Accord was signed in\nJune 2001 by seven founding signatories representing, Australia,\nCanada, Hong Kong, Ireland, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and South\nAfrica, and is specifically focused on academic programmes dealing\nwith engineering technology. In fact, the Sydney Accord acknowledges\nthe accreditation as a key foundation for the practice of engineering\ntechnology in each of the countries or territories covered by the Accord\nand recognizes the important roles of engineering technologists as part\n\nof a broader engineering team.\n\n22. The gist of documents placed before us unequivocally demonstrate\nthat that the degree of B.Tech. (Hons.) is not equivalent to B.E. degree\nbut both are two distinct disciplines of knowledge in the field of\nEngineering and Technology with distinct syllabi and programme\nobjectives but may be treated at par for recruitment, pay scales and\ngrades. The covenants of the MOU between HEC and PEC also\nrecognizes that substantial equivalence, authorization, and\naccreditation of engineering qualification can only be issued by the PEC\nwhich is responsible for granting engineering professional equivalence\nin consultation with the HEC. The word “equivalent” has been defined\n\nin the different law lexicons as under: -\n\n1. Black's Law Dictionary (Ninth Edition), page 620: “Equal in\nvalue, force, amount, effect, or significance. Corresponding in effect\nor function; nearly equal; virtually identical”.\n\n2. Corpus Juris Secundum (Volume 30A), page 862-863: “Alike in\nsignificance and value; as good as; equal or identical; identical in\neffect; equal in worth or value, force, power, effect, import, and the\nlike; equally good; equal so far as concerns the matter under\nconsideration; of equal value, force, import, and effect; having\nequal or corresponding import, meaning, or significance; of the\nsame import or meaning”.\n\n3. Words and Phrases (Volume 15), page 158: “To be “equivalent to'\nmeans to be equal in value, to be the same, corresponding to and\nto be worth”.\n\n23. According to PEC, B.Tech. courses are implementation oriented\n\nand B.Sc. engineering courses are design and research oriented. The\n\nCAs 1471/13 & 53/2014 &187-191/2018 17\n\nNCRC in 2010 had also decided that B.Tech. (Hons.) is not equivalent\nto B.Sc. (Eng.). Both qualifications are also regulated internationally\nthrough two separate accords. The Bachelor of Science in Engineering\nemphasizes theories and advanced concepts, while an Engineering\nTechnology degree emphasizes hands-on application and\nimplementation with the major difference that B.E. is more knowledge-\nbased while B.Tech. is skill-oriented. According to the Michigan\nTechnological University, USA, “Engineering graduates” apply\nscientific, theoretic, and economic knowledge to research, invent,\ndesign, and build structures, devices, and systems, making for a broad\ndiscipline that encompasses specialized fields of engineering. While\n“Engineering technology graduates” develop, design, and implement\nengineering and technology solutions, typically pursuing engineering\ncareers in manufacturing firms on design, construction, and product\n\nimprovement [Ref: https: / /www.mtu.edu/admissions /academics/majors/differences]. A\n\nsimilar controversy was also dealt with by this Court to some extent in\n\nthe following dictums:\n\n1. Muhammad Sadiq and others Vs University of Sindh and\nanother (PLD 1996 SC 182). It was held that the High Court in\nexercise of its Constitutional jurisdiction cannot sit as a Court of\nappeal over the decision of a body incorporated tinder the statutes\nfor deciding the question, whether a particular qualification is to be\nrecognized under the relevant statute. The fact that Sindh\nUniversity, or the University Grants Commission or the\nGovernment of Pakistan treats a particular qualification equivalent\nto a particular professional qualification, will not be relevant for the\npurpose of decision by the authority concerned under the relevant\nstatute. So, the decision of Sindh University to treat M.Sc.\n(Communications) or M.Sc. (Electronics) as engineering\nqualification will not be binding on Pakistan Engineering Council,\nnor the decision of the Government of Pakistan that B. Tech.\n(Honours) will be equivalent to Bachelor of Engineering, would be\nbinding on Pakistan Engineering Council.\n\n2. Fida Hussain Vs. The secretary, Kashmir Affairs and\nNorthern Affairs Division, Islamabad (PLD 1995 SC 701). This was\na Suo Motu Review Petition in Civil Appeal No. 216 of 1991 before\nthe five members bench of this Court. The Court considered the\nletter of Minister for Education and Provincial Coordination\nwhereby, it was conveyed that B. Tech. (Honours) shall be treated\nat par with B. Sc. (Engineering)/B.E. Degree. This Court held that\nit is the domain of the Government concerned to decide whether a\nparticular academic qualification of a civil servant employee is\nsufficient for promotion from one grade to another higher grade and\nwhereas it is in the domain of the Pakistan Engineering Council to\ndecide, as to whether a particular academic qualification can be\nequated with another academic qualification, but it has no power to\nsay that the civil servants/employees holding particular academic\nqualifications cannot be promoted from a particular grade to a\nhigher grade.\n\n3. Maula Bux Shaikh and others VS Chief Minister Sindh and\nothers (2018 SCMR 2098). The Court again held that it is the\n\n\nCAs 1471/13 & 53/2014 &187-191/2018 18\n\ndomain of the Government to decide whether a particular academic\nqualification of a civil servant/employee is sufficient for promotion\nfrom one grade to another higher grade and whereas it is in the\ndomain of the Pakistan Engineering Council to decide whether a\nparticular academic qualification can be equated with another\nacademic qualification. Thus, professional engineering work can\nonly be performed by a person who is registered as registered\nengineer or professional engineer and both registered engineer and\nprofessional engineer in terms of the PEC Act are by law required to\npossess accredited engineering qualification as prescribed by the\nPEC Act from accredited engineering institution.\n\n24. One more important aspect that cannot be ignored is that under\nSection 10 (e) of the HEC Ordinance, the HEC has been vested with the\npowers to set up national or regional evaluation councils or authorize\nany existing council or similar body to carry out accreditation of\nInstitutions including their departments, faculties, and disciplines by\ngiving them appropriate ratings. Pursuant to aforesaid power and\nfunction, the HEC has constituted the National Technology Council\n(“NTC”), vide notification (HEC No.19-3 /HEC/HRM/2015/9721)\ndated 07.09.2015 which was published in the Gazette of Pakistan on\n02.10.2015. The NTC has been given a mandate to carry out\naccreditation of all 04-year programs leading to technology degrees over\na span of 16 years of learning. The technology education curriculum\nhas been aligned pursuant to the guidelines of the HEC with the spirit\nof outcome-based education system in conformity with the Sydney\nAccord. Now, the NTC is empowered to accredit Higher Education\nInstitutions Programs for graduate technologists and _ define\naccreditation and certification standards. The NTC is comprised of a\nChairman, 23 members including the representative of PEC, and 04\nother representatives of different Ministries. The NTC has started\naccreditation to the Higher Education Institutions (HEI) with the\ncurrent standards of technology education degree programs\ncomparable with international standards. Besides the role or mandate\nof accreditation, the NTC has also started registration of BSc\nEngineering Technology, B.Tech. (Hons.), B.Tech, B.S. Technology/B.E.\nTechnology/B.Sc. Technology Degrees and maintaining National\nRegister of Technologists (NRT). The ‘Professional Engineering\nTechnologist’ may also apply after acquiring 5 years of post-\nqualification experience in the relevant technology discipline. The\nformation of NTC and conferring mandate of accreditation and\nregistration by itself is sufficient to comprehend that in order to end\nthis long standing dispute or controversy, the NTC has been\nconstituted parallel to the PEC for accreditation and registration of\n\nEngineering Technologist, which is sufficient prove that B.Tech. (Hons.)\n\nCAs 1471/13 & 53/2014 &187-191/2018 19\n\nis not equivalent B. Sc. (Engineering) and for this reason, the PEC does\nnot allow accreditation and registration of Engineering Technologists.\nThe underlying wisdom and objective of setting up the NTC is to engage\nin sustainable policy framework for separate career paths for engineers\nand technologists in sectors where both are employed in a parallel\nservice track. According to the learned Additional Attorney General, the\nNTC has also taken some material steps for attaining the status of\nprovisional signatory to the Sydney Accord for performing its task more\n\nproactively and dynamically [Ref: https://www.ntc-hec.org.pk].\n\n25. The Lahore High Court in the two judgments (impugned in C.A.\nNos. 187 to 191/2013) set aside the minutes of Agenda No. 9 of the\n66‘ Board of Director Meeting of the appellant whereby 09 Seats were\nallocated to Diploma Holders & 03 Seats were allocated to B.Tech.\n(Hons.) for promotion. The essential qualifications for appointment to\nany post is the sole discretion and decision of the employer. The\nemployer may prescribe required qualifications and the preference for\nappointment of candidate who is best suited to his requirements. The\ncourt cannot set down the guidelines or conditions of eligibility or\nfitness for appointment or promotion to any particular post. In no case\ncan the Court, in the garb of judicial review, seize the chair of the\nappointing authority to decide what is best for the employer and\nimpose conditions in internal recruitment matters, unless there is a\ngrave violation of applicable law, rules and regulations. In the private\nsectors, the employer is free to decide the criteria of appointment and\npromotions and other terms and conditions of employment and for this\npurpose, may set down its business strategy, H.R. policies, and\nprogression plans. Whereas for the appointment, transfer and\npromotion in the civil service, the Appointment, Promotion and\nTransfer Rules framed by the Federal Government and Provincial\nGovernments separately under their Civil Servants Acts are prevailed\nand followed and in case of statutory bodies, appointments and\npromotions are made in accordance with their statutory requirements,\nrules and regulations; but in all such circumstances, it is within the\ndomain of the competent authority to prescribe required qualification\nand experience in the recruitment and promotion process. The courts\ncannot force to accept or interchange any other qualification equivalent\nto the specific post with specific qualification advertised for inviting\napplications for recruitment or setting benchmark for promotion of\n\nemployees to any particular post or grade on attaining any particular\n\nCAs 1471/13 & 53/2014 &187-191/2018 20\n\nlength of service. According to the Fida Hussain case (supra) also, this\nCourt held that it is the domain of the Government concerned to decide\nwhether a particular academic qualification of a civil servant employee\nis sufficient for promotion from one grade to another higher grade,\nwhereas it is in the domain of the PEC to decide as to whether a\nparticular academic qualification can be equated with another\nacademic qualification, but it has no power to say that the civil\nservants/employees holding particular academic qualifications cannot\nbe promoted from a particular grade to a higher grade. The same\n\nprinciple was reiterated in the case of Maula Bux Shaikh (supra).\n\n26. In the wake of the above discussion, the C.A. Nos.53/2014 is\ndismissed and judgment passed by the High Court in F.A.O.71/2011 is\nmaintained. The C.A. Nos. 187 to 191/2013 are allowed. Consequently,\nthe impugned judgments passed by the Lahore High Court in the Writ\nPetition No. 5578/10 & Writ Petition No.5040/2010 as well as the\njudgments passed in Intra Court Appeals. No.157 and 275/2011 are\nset aside. The C.A.No.1471/2013 is also allowed as a result thereof, the\nimpugned judgment passed by the Peshawar High Court in Writ\nPetition No.1124/2006 is set aside.\n\nChief Justice\n\nJudge\n\nJudge\n\nAnnounced in open Court\n\non. at Islamabad Judge\nKhalid\nApproved for reporting", "CleanedText": "JUDGMENT Muhammad Ali Mazhar, J. These Civil Appeals with leave of the Court are directed against the judgment dated 21.02.2013 passed by the Peshawar High Court whereby the Writ Petition No.1124/2006 filed by the respondent was allowed; the judgment dated 07.10.2013, passed by the Peshawar High Court whereby F.A.0O.71/2011 filed by the appellant was dismissed, and the judgment dated 17.01.2017 passed by the Lahore High Court, Multan Bench, whereby the Intra Court Appeals No.157 and 275/2011 filed by the appellants were dismissed. 2. The precise facts of the civil appeals are as under: - I C.A.No.1471/2013 The respondent No.1 applied for admission in M.Sc. Engineering in KPK NWFP University of Engineering and Technology, Peshawar. During scrutiny, it was revealed that the respondent No.1 did not possess the pre-requisite qualification for admission in M.Sc. According to the University Rules and Regulations, the qualification of B.Tech. Hons. was not equivalent to B.Sc. Engineering; therefore, he was declared ineligible for admission. The respondent No.1 filed a Writ Petition No.1124/2006 in the Peshawar High Court, which was allowed vide impugned Judgment dated 21.02.2013. II C.A. Nos.53/2014 The appellant obtained a B.Tech degree from KPK University of Engineering Technology, Peshawar. The respondent invited applications for recruitment for the post of Assistant Executive Engineer BPS-17 in the Civil Engineering Department of Pakistan Railways, prescribing that candidates must hold a Bachelor s degree in Civil Engineering or an equivalent qualification. The candidature of the appellant was provisionally accepted and he was called upon to provide his registration with the Pakistan Engineering Council but the CAs 1471/13 53/2014 187-191/2018 3 appellant failed to provide such a Registration Certificate. Hence, his candidature was rejected. The appellant filed a Review Petition which was dismissed on 29.06.2011; hence, he filed F.A.O.71/2011 in the Peshawar High Court which was also dismissed vide Judgment dated 07.10.2013. III C.A. Nos. 187 to 191/2013 The respondents No. 1 to 4 filed Writ Petition No. 5578/10 in the Lahore High Court with the plea that they possess the qualification of B.Tech. Hons. in Electrical Power Technology and are performing duties as Line Superintendent. On 20.05.2010, the Board of Directors of the appellant, convened its 66t meeting wherein an Agenda No. 9 was approved according to which 09 Seats were allocated to Diploma Holders 03 Seats were allocated to B.Tech. Hons. for promotion from LS-I to Junior Engineer/SDO. The Writ Petition was allowed and the decision of the management on Agenda No. 9 was declared without lawful authority. On similar notion, another Writ Petition No.5040/2010 was also allowed. The appellants filed Intra Court Appeals No.157 and 275/2011 which were dismissed by the High Court vide impugned consolidated judgment dated 17.01.2017. 3. Initially, the leave to appeal was granted by this Court in C.P.No.235-P of 2013 C.A.1471/2013 on 05.12.2013 in the following terms: - Petitioners learned counsel, inter alia, contends that the learned High Court did not appreciate that to grant equivalence of the B.Tech Hons with B.E./B.Sc Engineering, it had no jurisdiction and the power fell in the exclusive domain of the Pakistan Engineering Council/petitioner under section 2 8 of the Pakistan Engineering Council Act, 1975. 2. After hearing learned counsel for the petitioner s leave is granted, inter-alia, to consider the issue raised. CMA No. 411-P/2013 Notice. In the meanwhile, the impugned judgment shall remain suspended. Based on the aforesaid leave granting order, the leave was also granted in similar terms in other civil petitions which were converted into appeals and fixed together for decision. 4. The learned counsel for the appellants in CA No. 1471/2013 argued that the admission of respondent No.1 was cancelled in view of Rule CAs 1471/13 53/2014 187-191/2018 4 1.1 of the Post-Graduate Prospectus 2005-2006 of the University of Engineering Technology, Peshawar. It was further averred that according to the provisions of the Pakistan Engineering Council Act, 1976 PEC Act , the Pakistan Engineering Council PEC can only register individuals who have qualified with a B.E/B.Sc. Engineering degree. He further argued that the Higher Education Commission HEC can only determine the standing of two degrees at comparable levels but there is a difference between equivalence and accreditation. The former is the domain of the HEC and the latter is the mandate of the PEC appellant for which HEC recognizes that insofar as interchangeability or accreditation or authorizing the same status is concerned, it is the domain of the respective regulatory/accreditation council. In support of his contention, the learned counsel referred to the judgments passed by this Court in the case of Maula Bux Shaikh vs. Chief Minister Sindh others 2018 SCMR 2098 , Fida Hussain vs. Secretary Kashmir Affairs 1996 PLC C.S 44 and Muhammad Sadiq vs. University of Sindh another PLD 1996 Supreme Court 182 . 5. In CA No. 1471/2013, Muhammad Farooq Malik, Deputy District Officer Roads Kharian, District Gujrat, filed CMA No. 5008 2014 under Order V Rule 2 2 of the Supreme Court Rules, 1980, to be impleaded as a necessary and proper party as an office bearer of the Pakistan Diploma Engineers Federation Regd. and the B. Tech. Graduates Society Regd. , which application was allowed. He, inperson, addressed that though the controversy is regarding the cancellation of the admission of respondent No.1, he is only concerned with the issue of equivalence. He argued that B.Tech. Hons. individuals are agitating promotion matters in light of the judgment of this Court in Suo Motu Review Petition, reported as PLD 1995 SC 701. Despite settling the issue, the appellant is continuously interfering in the equivalence of B.Tech. Hons. vis-a-vis B.E/B.Sc. Engineering qualification. He also relied on the decision of the University Grants Commission UGC dated 12t February, 1998, wherein it was decided that the degree of B.Tech. Hons. is not similar to B.E./B.Sc. Engineering degree but both the degrees are to be considered as two distinct disciplines of knowledge in the field of Engineering and Technology and should run parallel to each other. 6. The learned Counsel for the appellant in C.A. Nos.53/2014, argued that the degree of B.Tech. has always been considered as equivalent to CAs 1471/13 53/2014 187-191/2018 5 B.Sc. Engineering, thus the rejection of the candidature of the petitioner on the ground of B.Tech. Degree not being equivalent to B.Sc. Engineering was illegal. He further contended for the post of Assistant Executive Engineer BPS-17 Civil Engineering, there was no requirement of registration with the PEC. He also referred to the judgment passed by this Court in Suo Muto Review Petition No. 52 of 1993 and argued that the PEC has no authority to oppose equivalency to the B.Tech. Hons. degree which is the function of the HEC. 7. The Deputy Director, Federal Public Service Commission FPSC , addressed in C.A. Nos.53/2014, that 09 posts of Assistant Executive Engineers in the Civil Engineering Department of Pakistan Railways were advertised on receipt of requisition from the Ministry of Railway with a prescribed qualification of Bachelor s degree in Civil Engineering or equivalent qualification. The B.Tech. Hons. degree in Civil Engineering has not been declared by the PEC as equivalent to the required qualification of Bachelor degree in Civil Engineering. A meeting was convened on 19.02.2011, wherein the representative of the PEC stated that Technology and Engineering are two separate and distinct streams, with different, distinct syllabi and programme objectives. In the recent past, PEC in its 22.4 Annual General Body Meeting has adopted two resolutions regarding the non-equivalence of the B.Tech. degree to the B.E. degree. 8. The learned counsel for the appellant in C.A. Nos. 187 to 191/2013, argued that B.Tech. Hons. is not at par with B.Sc. Engineering Degree. The B.Tech. holders are not allowed registration with the PEC. It was further averred that the first and second Schedule of the PEC Act, 1976 read with Sections 10, 11, and 16 debar B.Tech. Hons. to be considered equivalent to B.Sc. Professional Engineers as both have different characteristics and disciplines. He further argued that High Court had no jurisdiction to declare B.Tech. Hons. equivalent or at par with a B.Sc. Professional Engineering Degree. 9. The learned counsel for the respondents in C.A. Nos. 187 to 191/2013, argued that the respondents were promoted as SDO/Junior Engineer-17 in 2004 and 2005 respectively. They acquired degree of B.Tech. Hons. Electrical, therefore, the issue of promotion is a matter between the employer and the employee which has nothing to do with the PEC. It was further contended that the employer is free to ask for any qualification. It was further averred that the HEC vide letter dated CAs 1471/13 53/2014 187-191/2018 6 29.03.2019 decided that that both the degrees of B.E/B.Sc. Engineering and B.Tech. Hons. are two distinct disciplines of knowledge in the field of Engineering and Technology but should run parallel to each other. It was further averred that the High Court in its judgments rightly set aside the decision of the Board of Directors dated 20.5.2010 of the appellant MEPCO wherein an Agenda No.9 was approved for allocating only 03 Seats to B.Tech. Hons. for promotion from LS-I to Junior Engineer/SDO. 10. The learned Additional Attorney General argued that the UGC, predecessor of the HEC, resolved on 25.11.1981 that the B.Tech. Hons. degree, awarded by Polytechnic Institutions/Universities, be considered at par with B.Sc. Engineering degree awarded by other Universities in Pakistan. However, UGC s Equivalence Committee on 04.01.1983 and 12.02.1998 concluded that the degree of B.Tech. Hons. is not similar to B.E/B.Sc. Engineering degree. It was further contended that the National Curriculum Revision Committee NCRC in the year 2010 also acknowledged that both degrees are two distinct disciplines of knowledge and HEC constituted a Committee of Experts for recommendations on the same subject matter and recommendations of the NCRC were placed before HEC s Committee of Experts on 11.03.2014. The Committee of Experts unanimously endorsed the recommendations of NCRC. In support of his contention, he also referred to the case of Maula Bux Shaikh, reported as 2018 SCMR 2098. It was further argued that HEC s mandate to determine equivalence under Section 10 1 0 of the Higher Education Commission Ordinance, 2002 HEC Ordinance is limited to the extent of standing of a degree or level of education which includes the number of schooling years, credit hours gained during program, and recognition of foreign degrees but HEC cannot encroach upon the domain of the PEC. He also pointed out that there is a Memorandum of Understanding MOU between HEC and PEC which recognizes that substantial equivalence, authorization, and accreditation of engineering qualification can only be issued by the by the PEC which is responsible for granting engineering professional equivalence in consultation with the HEC. He referred to Sections 10 and 11 of PEC Act in support of his submissions and also relied on the judgment in the case of Muhammad Sadiq reported as PLD 1996 Supreme Court 182 and Fida Hussain case, reported as 1996 PLC C.S 44. CAs 1471/13 53/2014 187-191/2018 7 11. Heard the arguments. The admission of respondent No.1 C.A.No.1471/2013 in M.Sc. Engineering in KPK NWFP University of Engineering and Technology, Peshawar was cancelled in view of the Postgraduate Prospectus 2005-2006 of the University wherein according to Regulation 1.1 b , candidates seeking admission to M.Sc. Degree Programme must have a Bachelor s Degree in a relevant Engineering discipline from an institution accredited by the PEC and since the B.Tech. Hons. qualification was not equivalent to B.Sc. Engineering; therefore, he was declared ineligible for admission. In the affairs of admission and examination in the educational institutions, the concerned authorities are vested with the powers and jurisdiction to lay down the eligibility criteria in their own rules, regulations, or prospectus. They are independent to follow their own policy for admission, and in other affairs, therefore, the academic, administrative, and disciplinary autonomy of a university must be respected. The interference by the courts in the admission policy would give rise to glitches for the said institutions to administer the matters harmoniously and efficiently. The educational institutions are competent to manage their own affairs without any outside intervention from executive or judicial organs unless they contravene or disregard the compass of their authority or act in breach of applicable statutes or admission policies as laid down in the prospectus. There is no ambiguity in the eligibility criteria mentioned in the prospectus; hence, it was not open to any other interpretation. Nothing on record shows that while cancelling admission of the respondent No.1, the University committed any act in violation of their rules and regulations. The petitioner failed to achieve the admission criteria and hence, he was not entitled to admission. It was neither fair nor just or equitable to interfere into affairs falling into the exclusive domain of the university and its academia, therefore, the learned High Court was not justified to intervene in the admission policy which does not seem to be discriminatory or unlawful but is a fair benchmark for applying for admission in the M.Sc. Degree Programme. Reference may be made to following case law: 1. Noor Muhammad Khan Marwat vs. Vice Chancellor, Gomal University PLD 2001 219 . There is another aspect of the case. Universities have always been considered to be centres of high excellence where higher education is imparted and research facilities are regulated through its own discipline. Prominent jurists, educationists and research scholars are assigned administrative as well as educational and research assignments for achieving the object of higher education. Such authorities, generally CAs 1471/13 53/2014 187-191/2018 8 speaking, are competent to administer their own affairs without outside interference from executive or judicial organs. Unless University authorities transgress the scope of their authority or act in violation of the statute, Courts are always loath to interfere with the smooth administration of universities. 2. Muhammad Ilyas v. Bahauddin Zakariya University 2005 SCMR 961 . At the outset it may be noted that as far as the rules/regulations framed by the University Authorities for the purpose of conductive/regularizing examination etc. of University are concerned these are required to be interpreted by the University Authorities itself and Courts should avoid to interpret the same unless a case of grave injustice is not made out otherwise it would become difficult for University administration to run its internal affairs relating to examination, etc... therefore, no interference is called for by this Court in exercise of jurisdiction under Article 185 3 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan. 3. Secretary Economic Affairs Division, Islamabad v. Anwarul-Haq Ahmed 2013 SCMR 1687 . The educational institutions are independent to follow policy for admission including affairs relating to changing conditions for endowment funds or fee, either under the policy given by the government or adopted by the college; and interference in the policy by the Court is possible only in exceptional circumstances. 4. Murad Ali Khan v. Vice Chancellor, University of Health Sciences, Lahore 2016 SCMR 134 . It is a settled law that in matters of admission and examination in educational institutions, the University authorities concerned are the sole judges of the criteria laid down in the prospectus. The Courts in such matters desist from interfering due to the reason that it would create difficulties for the said institutions to run its affairs in an appropriate manner according to their rules and regulations. 5. Khyber Medical University and others v. Aimal Khan and others PLD 2022 SC 92 . The self-restraint by the courts in matter of educational institutions is based on the wisdom that academic freedom and institutional autonomy of the universities must be protected and safeguarded. Academic freedom is not merely liberty from restraints on thought, expression, and association in the university, but also that the university should have the freedom to make decisions about the educational matters including disciplinary matters. As it is the business of a university to provide that atmosphere which is most conducive to speculation, experiment, and creation. It is an atmosphere in which there prevail the four essential freedoms of a university; who may teach, what may be taught, how it shall be taught and who may be admitted to study. 12. The purpose of constituting the PEC under the PEC Act is to make provisions for the regulation of the engineering profession and to regulate the engineering profession with the vision that the engineering profession shall function as a key driving force for achieving rapid and sustainable growth in all national, economic, and social fields and CAs 1471/13 53/2014 187-191/2018 9 maintain realistic and internationally relevant standards of professional competence and ethics for engineers, and license engineers, and engineering institutions, to competently and professionally promote and uphold the standards and the Council, covering the entire spectrum of engineering disciplines, functions as an apex body to encourage and promote the pursuit of excellence in engineering profession, and to regulate the quality of engineering education and the practice of engineering. The definitions provided under Section 2 of the PEC Act which are relevant to decide the present controversy are reproduced as under: - i Accreditation Committee means the Accreditation Committee constituted under sub-section 1 of section 14; ii accredited engineering qualification means any of the qualification included in the First Schedule or the Second Schedule; viii Council means the Pakistan Engineering Council constituted under section 3; xxiii professional engineer means a person who holds an accredited engineering qualification and after obtaining a professional experience of five years, whether working privately or in the employment of an engineering public organization, has passed the prescribed engineering practice examination and is registered as such by the Council; xxv professional engineering work means the giving of professional advice and opinions, the making of measurements and layouts, the preparation of reports, computations, designs, drawings, plans and specifications and the construction, inspection, and supervision of engineering works, in respect of - a railways, aerodromes, bridges, tunnels, and metalled roads; b dams, canals, harbours, light houses; c works of an electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, communication, aeronautical power engineering, geological or mining character; d waterworks, sewers, filtration, purification, and incinerator works; e residential and non-residential buildings, including foundations framework and electrical and mechanical systems thereof; f structures accessory to engineering works and intended to house them; g imparting or promotion of engineering education, training and planning, designing, development construction, commissioning, operation, maintenance and management of engineering works in respect of computer engineering, environmental engineering, chemical engineering, structural engineering, industrial engineering, production engineering, marine engineering and CAs 1471/13 53/2014 187-191/2018 10 naval architecture, petroleum and gas engineering, metallurgical engineering, agricultural engineering, telecommunication engineering, avionics and space engineering, transportation engineering, air-conditioning ventilation, cold storage works, system engineering, electronics, radio and television engineering, civil engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering etc.; h organizing, managing, and conducting the teaching and training in engineering universities, colleges, institutions, Government colleges of technology, polytechnic institutions, and technical training institutions; ij preparing standard bidding or contract documents, construction cost data, conciliation, and arbitration procedures; guidelines for bid evaluation, prequalification and price adjustments for construction and consultancy contracts; and j any other work which the Council may, by notification in the official Gazette, declare to be an engineering work for the purposes of this Act; xxvii registered engineer means a person who holds an accredited engineering qualification, whether working privately or in the employment of an engineering public organization and is registered as such by the Council. Registered Engineer shall perform all professional engineering works except independently signing design; xxviii registered means registered under this Act; 13. The Functions of the PEC are provided under Section 8 of the PEC Act which inter alia include as under: - a maintenance of a Register of persons qualified to work as registered engineers, professional engineers, consulting engineers, constructors, and operators; b accreditation of engineering qualifications for the purpose of registration of registered engineers, professional engineers c removal of names from the Register and restoration to the Register of names which have been removed 14. While the objective of the HEC Ordinance which repealed The University Grants Commission Act, 1974 is to provide the establishment of the HEC in the interest of improvement and promotion of higher education, research, and development. The powers and functions of the HEC are laid down under Section 10 of the HEC Ordinance for the evaluation, improvement, and promotion of higher education, research, and development. Clause 0 of the aforesaid functions germane to the grant of equivalence, which is reproduced as under: - o determine the equivalence and recognition of degrees, diplomas and certificates awarded by Institutions within the country and aboard CAs 1471/13 53/2014 187-191/2018 11 15. The chronicle of events bring to light that on October 26, 1973, pursuant to the decision of the Federal Government, the Ministry of Education had issued a policy letter wherein, it was conveyed that B.Tech. Hons. shall be treated at par with B.Sc. Engineering /B.E. degree . Likewise, the erstwhile UGC Equivalence Committee resolved on 25.11.1981 in the 10 meeting of Equivalence Committee that B.Tech. Hons. degree awarded by Polytechnic Institutions/ Universities be considered at par with B.Sc. Engg. degree awarded by other Institutions/Universities in Pakistan . However, in the 11t Meeting of the erstwhile UGC s Equivalence Committee convened on 04.01.1983, it was resolved that the degree of B.Tech. Hons. be not considered as equivalent to the B.E degree but the two must be considered as two distinct disciplines of knowledge in the field of Engineering and Technology and both streams should run parallel to each other. However, B.Tech. Hons. degree holders may be treated at par with B.E./B.Sc. Eng. degree holders as far as grades of pay etc. are concerned but these two degrees would not be considered the same at any stage. Yet again on 12.02.1998, the erstwhile UGC s Equivalence Committee in its 39tt meeting, resolved that the degree of B.Tech. Hons. is not similar to B.E./B.Sc. Engineering degree. Both the degrees of B.E./B.Sc. Engineering and B.Tech. Hons. be considered as two distinct disciplines of knowledge in the field of Engineering and Technology and should run parallel to each other. However, B.Tech. Hons. may be treated at par and compatible with B.E./B.Sc. Engineering degree holders as far as grades, pay and promotions and other benefits are concerned. It was further resolved that it is up to the employer to determine the type of qualification required for a particular job. 16. The record further reflects that the NCRC in 2010 made the recommendations that the letter issued by the HEC regarding the equivalency/compatibility of B.Tech. with B.Sc. Engineering must be withdrawn immediately to remove any confusion, because B.Tech. courses are implementation oriented and B.Sc. engineering courses are design and research oriented. The said recommendations were placed before the HEC Committee of Experts in its Meeting dated 11th March, 2014, where the Committee unanimously endorsed the recommendations of the NCRC that B.Tech. Hons. is not equivalent to B.Sc. Eng. . Both the degrees of B.E/B.Sc. Engineering and B.Tech. Hons. be considered as two distinct disciplines of knowledge in the CAs 1471/13 53/2014 187-191/2018 12 field of Engineering and Technology and should run parallel to each other. The HEC Accreditation Equivalence Committee in its 4t meeting held on 02.12.2014, formally approved the recommendations of the Committee of Experts. Despite the approval of recommendations, the HEC again convened a special meeting with the NCRC which was held on 08.10.2015 at HEC Islamabad to revisit whether the NCRC had the right to suggest a withdrawal of equivalence between B.Tech. and B.Sc. Engineering. The House unanimously declared that it was not the purview of the previous NCRC committee; therefore, degree status may be continued as per Government Policy 1973. At this juncture, it is pertinent to mention that an MOU between HEC and PEC was also executed on 15.05.2015 for developing linkages, collaboration, and coordination within the entire process of accreditation for formalizing respective roles. According to Article 6 of the MOU, the PEC is made responsible for granting engineering professional equivalence in consultation with the HEC whereas the Pakistan Qualification Framework PQP will remain in the purview of the HEC. However, on 15.11.2019, the 8th HEC Equivalence and Accreditation Committee was convened on the same subject, and the Committee, after detailed deliberation decided that both degrees of B.Sc. Engg. /B.E. Engineering and B.Tech. Hons. are not equivalent but could be considered at par for employment, grade, promotion, etc. in their respective cadre/streams. The decision of the 8 Accreditation Equivalence Committee meeting was reaffirmed in the HEC s 9th Accreditation and Equivalence Committee meeting held on 03.05.2021. 17. All over again, in the 10 Accreditation and Equivalence Committee meeting of HEC held on 17.11.2021, the matter was reviewed on the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee, and it was resolved that a Bachelor s degree in Engineering minimum 16 years education and a Bachelor s degree in Technology minimum 16 years education are at par for recruitment, pay scales and grades. However, vide letter dated 17.01.2022, the HEC, through its Executive Director communicated the revision of minutes of the 10 Accreditation Equivalence Committee to the PEC and stated in paragraph 6 of the aforesaid letter that the It is further clarified that word equivalence has not been mentioned in the final resolution of the aforesaid notification 8.12.2021 and it is only mentioned that both the qualifications are at par for recruitment, pay scales and grades . CAs 1471/13 53/2014 187-191/2018 13 18. The perusal of Section 10 of the PEC Act divulges that the engineering qualifications granted by engineering institutions in Pakistan which are included in the First Schedule shall be the accredited engineering qualifications for the purposes of this Act and for this purpose, the Council has constituted an Accreditation Committee under Section 14 the same Act for organizing and carrying out a comprehensive program of accreditation of engineering universities, colleges and institutions etc. according to the criteria approved by the Governing Body in consultation with HEC. The PEC also maintains a Register under Section 16 of the Act in which the names and other particulars of persons possessing accredited engineering qualifications whose application for registration as registered engineers, professional engineers, consulting engineers, constructors and operators are, from time to time, granted by the PEC and entered in the Register. Whereas the penalties and procedure are provided under Section 27 of the PEC Act and whoever undertakes any professional engineering work shall, if his name is not for the time being borne on the Register, be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to ten thousand rupees, or with both, and, in the case of a continuing offence, with a further fine which may extend to two hundred rupees for every day after the first during which the offence continues. It is further provided that whoever willfully procures or attempts to procure himself or itself to be registered under PEC Act as a registered engineer, professional engineer, consulting engineer, constructor or operator by making or producing or causing to be made or produced any false or fraudulent representation or declaration, either orally or in writing, and any person who assists him therein shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three months, or with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with both and whoever falsely pretends to be registered under this Act, or not being registered under this Act, uses with his name of title any words or letters representing that he is so registered, irrespective of whether any person is actually deceived by such pretense or representation or not, shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three months, or with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with both. Section 27 of the PEC Act further cautions that no person shall undertake any professional engineering work, unless he is registered under this Act and no person shall, unless registered as a registered engineer or professional engineer, hold any post in an CAs 1471/13 53/2014 187-191/2018 14 engineering organization where he has to perform professional engineering work. 19. Last but not least, the powers of framing Regulations are provided under Section 25A of the PEC Act, wherein the Governing Body may, in consultation with the committee of Vice-Chancellors of the Universities of Engineering and Technology of Pakistan set up by the HEC, make regulations, not inconsistent with the provisions of the this Act and the bye-laws, to provide for a minimum standard of courses of study and practical training for obtaining graduate and post-graduate engineering qualifications to be included in the First and Second Schedules; b minimum requirement for the content and duration of courses of study as aforesaid; c minimum qualifications for admission to engineering institutions offering course of study and laying down minimum standard for holding admission examinations; d qualification and experience required of teachers for appointment in engineering universities, colleges and institutions; e minimum standards of examinations, and duration and standard of practical training, for securing accreditation of engineering qualifications under this Act; and f qualifications and experience required of examiners for professional examinations of accredited engineering qualifications. In exercise of the powers conferred by Section 25A of the PEC Act, the PEC framed Regulations for Engineering Education in Pakistan in 1985 vide S.R.0.1142 I /85. The relevant Article is reproduced as under:- Article 2. Minimum Qualification for Admission to Engineering Bachelor s Degree Programmes Offered by Engineering Institutions Universities. A candidate seeking admission in an Engineering Institution/ University for working towards Bachelor s Degree in any recognized branch of Engineering must fulfill the following minimum requirements: ii A candidate possessing four years degree/ qualification of B.Tech Hons /B.S/B.Sc./Bachelor of Technology with relevant discipline or equivalent qualification duly recognized by HEC seeking admission towards the relevant engineering discipline against 02 reserved seats of B.Tech Hons /B.S/B.Sc./Bachelor of Technology with relevant discipline , shall be considered for admission in 2021 and after; with two years of exemption subject to assessment of courses studied by concerned HEI for allowing maximum 40 credit hours transfer and satisfying PEC Regulations, and where needed qualifying remedial courses, shall be eligible for registration with the Council as per laid down criteria: Provided that a candidate possessing above qualifications, enrolled against the reserved seats during the period January 2015 to December 2020 shall CAs 1471/13 53/2014 187-191/2018 15 be considered for one year exemption; and Candidates possessing B.Tech Pass and B.Tech Hons or equivalent qualifications, enrolled up to 31st December, 2014 shall be considered for exemption of one and two years, respectively. Emphasis supplied . Qualification B.Tech. Hons. /B.S. Bachelor of Technology refers to four years technology degree/program. 20. If the B.Tech. Hons. is deemed to be equivalent to an engineering bachelor s degree programme then there was no justification to provide in the aforesaid regulation that the candidate possessing a four year degree/qualification of B.Tech Hons. , B.S., B.Sc., Bachelor of Technology or equivalent qualification duly recognized by the HEC seeking admission against 02 reserved seats of B.Tech Hons. /B.S./B.Sc./Bachelor of Technology shall be considered for admission in 2021 and after, with two years of exemption. The criteria set down for admission is self-explanatory that both degrees are distinct, with the rider that if a person who qualified B.Tech. Hons. applies for admission to Engineering Bachelor s Degree programme offered by Engineering Institutions and Universities, he can avail certain exemptions subject to assessment of courses and satisfying the PEC Regulations. 21. The rationale of the PEC Act is to devise the provisions for regulation of the engineering profession and for achieving this task, the PEC has been constituted comprising of specialists and experts in the field. The main function of the PEC is the recognition and accreditation of engineering qualifications for registration in accordance with the PEC Act. If the entire facts are seen in juxtaposition, it is clear beyond any shadow of doubt that the PEC persistently expressed to HEC that engineering and technology qualifications are two distinct streams of the engineering profession and cannot be considered equivalent. Both qualifications are regulated internationally through their separate accords i.e. Engineering Qualification by the Washington Accord while Engineering Technology by the Sydney Accord. The Washington Accord was signed in 1989 for providing mutual mechanism for recognition of graduates of accredited programme among its signatories which is a self-governing, autonomous agreement between national organizations signatories that provide external accreditation to tertiary educational programme that qualify their graduates for entry into professional engineering practice. Pakistan is also a signatory to this Accord and the status of the PEC has been duly acknowledged in CAs 1471/13 53/2014 187-191/2018 16 the treaty. The signatories are responsible for undertaking a clearly defined process of periodic peer review to ensure that the accredited programmes are substantially equivalent and their outcomes are consistent with the published professional engineer graduate attribute exemplar. The PEC has also entered into other international agreements such as the International Professional Engineers Agreement IPEA , and the Federation of Engineering Institutions of Asia and the Pacific FEIAP . Whereas the Sydney Accord was signed in June 2001 by seven founding signatories representing, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Ireland, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and South Africa, and is specifically focused on academic programmes dealing with engineering technology. In fact, the Sydney Accord acknowledges the accreditation as a key foundation for the practice of engineering technology in each of the countries or territories covered by the Accord and recognizes the important roles of engineering technologists as part of a broader engineering team. 22. The gist of documents placed before us unequivocally demonstrate that that the degree of B.Tech. Hons. is not equivalent to B.E. degree but both are two distinct disciplines of knowledge in the field of Engineering and Technology with distinct syllabi and programme objectives but may be treated at par for recruitment, pay scales and grades. The covenants of the MOU between HEC and PEC also recognizes that substantial equivalence, authorization, and accreditation of engineering qualification can only be issued by the PEC which is responsible for granting engineering professional equivalence in consultation with the HEC. The word equivalent has been defined in the different law lexicons as under: - 1. Black s Law Dictionary Ninth Edition , : Equal in value, force, amount, effect, or significance. Corresponding in effect or function; nearly equal; virtually identical . 2. Corpus Juris Secundum Volume 30A , -863: Alike in significance and value; as good as; equal or identical; identical in effect; equal in worth or value, force, power, effect, import, and the like; equally good; equal so far as concerns the matter under consideration; of equal value, force, import, and effect; having equal or corresponding import, meaning, or significance; of the same import or meaning . 3. Words and Phrases Volume 15 , : To be equivalent to means to be equal in value, to be the same, corresponding to and to be worth . 23. According to PEC, B.Tech. courses are implementation oriented and B.Sc. engineering courses are design and research oriented. The CAs 1471/13 53/2014 187-191/2018 17 NCRC in 2010 had also decided that B.Tech. Hons. is not equivalent to B.Sc. Eng. . Both qualifications are also regulated internationally through two separate accords. The Bachelor of Science in Engineering emphasizes theories and advanced concepts, while an Engineering Technology degree emphasizes hands-on application and implementation with the major difference that B.E. is more knowledgebased while B.Tech. is skill-oriented. According to the Michigan Technological University, USA, Engineering graduates apply scientific, theoretic, and economic knowledge to research, invent, design, and build structures, devices, and systems, making for a broad discipline that encompasses specialized fields of engineering. While Engineering technology graduates develop, design, and implement engineering and technology solutions, typically pursuing engineering careers in manufacturing firms on design, construction, and product improvement Ref: https: / /www.mtu.edu/admissions /academics/majors/differences . A similar controversy was also dealt with by this Court to some extent in the following dictums: 1. Muhammad Sadiq and others Vs University of Sindh and another PLD 1996 SC 182 . It was held that the High Court in exercise of its Constitutional jurisdiction cannot sit as a Court of appeal over the decision of a body incorporated tinder the statutes for deciding the question, whether a particular qualification is to be recognized under the relevant statute. The fact that Sindh University, or the University Grants Commission or the Government of Pakistan treats a particular qualification equivalent to a particular professional qualification, will not be relevant for the purpose of decision by the authority concerned under the relevant statute. So, the decision of Sindh University to treat M.Sc. Communications or M.Sc. Electronics as engineering qualification will not be binding on Pakistan Engineering Council, nor the decision of the Government of Pakistan that B. Tech. Honours will be equivalent to Bachelor of Engineering, would be binding on Pakistan Engineering Council. 2. Fida Hussain Vs. The secretary, Kashmir Affairs and Northern Affairs Division, Islamabad PLD 1995 SC 701 . This was a Suo Motu Review Petition in Civil Appeal No. 216 of 1991 before the five members bench of this Court. The Court considered the letter of Minister for Education and Provincial Coordination whereby, it was conveyed that B. Tech. Honours shall be treated at par with B. Sc. Engineering /B.E. Degree. This Court held that it is the domain of the Government concerned to decide whether a particular academic qualification of a civil servant employee is sufficient for promotion from one grade to another higher grade and whereas it is in the domain of the Pakistan Engineering Council to decide, as to whether a particular academic qualification can be equated with another academic qualification, but it has no power to say that the civil servants/employees holding particular academic qualifications cannot be promoted from a particular grade to a higher grade. 3. Maula Bux Shaikh and others VS Chief Minister Sindh and others 2018 SCMR 2098 . The Court again held that it is the CAs 1471/13 53/2014 187-191/2018 18 domain of the Government to decide whether a particular academic qualification of a civil servant/employee is sufficient for promotion from one grade to another higher grade and whereas it is in the domain of the Pakistan Engineering Council to decide whether a particular academic qualification can be equated with another academic qualification. Thus, professional engineering work can only be performed by a person who is registered as registered engineer or professional engineer and both registered engineer and professional engineer in terms of the PEC Act are by law required to possess accredited engineering qualification as prescribed by the PEC Act from accredited engineering institution. 24. One more important aspect that cannot be ignored is that under Section 10 e of the HEC Ordinance, the HEC has been vested with the powers to set up national or regional evaluation councils or authorize any existing council or similar body to carry out accreditation of Institutions including their departments, faculties, and disciplines by giving them appropriate ratings. Pursuant to aforesaid power and function, the HEC has constituted the National Technology Council NTC , vide notification HEC No.19-3 /HEC/HRM/2015/9721 dated 07.09.2015 which was published in the Gazette of Pakistan on 02.10.2015. The NTC has been given a mandate to carry out accreditation of all 04-year programs leading to technology degrees over a span of 16 years of learning. The technology education curriculum has been aligned pursuant to the guidelines of the HEC with the spirit of outcome-based education system in conformity with the Sydney Accord. Now, the NTC is empowered to accredit Higher Education Institutions Programs for graduate technologists and define accreditation and certification standards. The NTC is comprised of a Chairman, 23 members including the representative of PEC, and 04 other representatives of different Ministries. The NTC has started accreditation to the Higher Education Institutions HEI with the current standards of technology education degree programs comparable with international standards. Besides the role or mandate of accreditation, the NTC has also started registration of BSc Engineering Technology, B.Tech. Hons. , B.Tech, B.S. Technology/B.E. Technology/B.Sc. Technology Degrees and maintaining National Register of Technologists NRT . The Professional Engineering Technologist may also apply after acquiring 5 years of postqualification experience in the relevant technology discipline. The formation of NTC and conferring mandate of accreditation and registration by itself is sufficient to comprehend that in order to end this long standing dispute or controversy, the NTC has been constituted parallel to the PEC for accreditation and registration of Engineering Technologist, which is sufficient prove that B.Tech. Hons. CAs 1471/13 53/2014 187-191/2018 19 is not equivalent B. Sc. Engineering and for this reason, the PEC does not allow accreditation and registration of Engineering Technologists. The underlying wisdom and objective of setting up the NTC is to engage in sustainable policy framework for separate career paths for engineers and technologists in sectors where both are employed in a parallel service track. According to the learned Additional Attorney General, the NTC has also taken some material steps for attaining the status of provisional signatory to the Sydney Accord for performing its task more proactively and dynamically Ref: https://www.ntc-hec.org.pk . 25. The Lahore High Court in the two judgments impugned in C.A. Nos. 187 to 191/2013 set aside the minutes of Agenda No. 9 of the 66 Board of Director Meeting of the appellant whereby 09 Seats were allocated to Diploma Holders 03 Seats were allocated to B.Tech. Hons. for promotion. The essential qualifications for appointment to any post is the sole discretion and decision of the employer. The employer may prescribe required qualifications and the preference for appointment of candidate who is best suited to his requirements. The court cannot set down the guidelines or conditions of eligibility or fitness for appointment or promotion to any particular post. In no case can the Court, in the garb of judicial review, seize the chair of the appointing authority to decide what is best for the employer and impose conditions in internal recruitment matters, unless there is a grave violation of applicable law, rules and regulations. In the private sectors, the employer is free to decide the criteria of appointment and promotions and other terms and conditions of employment and for this purpose, may set down its business strategy, H.R. policies, and progression plans. Whereas for the appointment, transfer and promotion in the civil service, the Appointment, Promotion and Transfer Rules framed by the Federal Government and Provincial Governments separately under their Civil Servants Acts are prevailed and followed and in case of statutory bodies, appointments and promotions are made in accordance with their statutory requirements, rules and regulations; but in all such circumstances, it is within the domain of the competent authority to prescribe required qualification and experience in the recruitment and promotion process. The courts cannot force to accept or interchange any other qualification equivalent to the specific post with specific qualification advertised for inviting applications for recruitment or setting benchmark for promotion of employees to any particular post or grade on attaining any particular CAs 1471/13 53/2014 187-191/2018 20 length of service. According to the Fida Hussain case supra also, this Court held that it is the domain of the Government concerned to decide whether a particular academic qualification of a civil servant employee is sufficient for promotion from one grade to another higher grade, whereas it is in the domain of the PEC to decide as to whether a particular academic qualification can be equated with another academic qualification, but it has no power to say that the civil servants/employees holding particular academic qualifications cannot be promoted from a particular grade to a higher grade. The same principle was reiterated in the case of Maula Bux Shaikh supra . 26. In the wake of the above discussion, the C.A. Nos.53/2014 is dismissed and judgment passed by the High Court in F.A.O.71/2011 is maintained. The C.A. Nos. 187 to 191/2013 are allowed. Consequently, the impugned judgments passed by the Lahore High Court in the Writ Petition No. 5578/10 Writ Petition No.5040/2010 as well as the judgments passed in Intra Court Appeals. No.157 and 275/2011 are set aside. The C.A.No.1471/2013 is also allowed as a result thereof, the impugned judgment passed by the Peshawar High Court in Writ Petition No.1124/2006 is set aside.

The crux of the matter is that by way of a Notification\nNo.7825-50/Rev:VI/4/A.Q/2008 dated 12.04,2010, the\nGovernment of N.W.F.P. (now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) changed the\nname of village Tambah Maira to Maira Swati Abad and in\npursuance of the said Notification name of the Government Middle\nSchool Tambah was also changed to Government Middle School\nMaira Swati Abad by the EDO (E&S), Mansehra vide order dated\n03.07.2010.

The record reveals that the inhabitant of Tamba Maira\nmoved an application to the DCO Mansehra for changing the name\nof Tamba Maira as Maira Swati Abad. On the basis of the said\napplication, Resolution No.319 was passed by the Provincial\nAssembly, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa whereafter vide Notification dated\n12.04.2010 issued by the Secretary to Government of NWFP,\nRevenue & Estate Department, Peshawar, the name of Tamba\nMaira was changed to Maira Swati Abad. On 14.09.2011, another\napplication by some inhabitants of Tamba Maira was made to the\nDCO wherein it was stated that population of the village is more\nthan thirty thousand comprising different communities/classes,\ntherefore, naming the village on a specific class’s name in a secret\nway is unjustified. The DCO on 17.10.2011 forwarded the said\napplication to the Secretary to Government of Khyber\nPakhtunkhwa (Respondent No.1) to review the process adopted for\nthe change of name of Tamba Maira. However, no action had been\ntaken on the said application so far. The DCO, in his letter dated\n17.10.2011, had pointed out to the Secretary, Revenue & Estate\nDepartment that proper procedure, as per the Khyber\nPakhtunkhwa Local Councils Naming and Renaming of Public\nPlaces Rules, 1994 (the Rules) published vide Gazette Notification\nNo,AOV/LCB/1-44/85 dated 10.08.1994, had not been followed\nwhile changing the name of village. The relevant clause of the said\n\nNotification is reproduced hereinbelow for an immediate reference:\n\n“2.

No.836-L/2013: This Appeal, with leave of\n\nthe Court granted vide order dated 06.08.2013, has been filed by the\nMst. Shahida Siddiga (“Appellant”), against the judgement of the Lahore\nHigh Court, Lahore, dated 16.01.2013, (“Impugned Judgement’),\nwhereby the judgments of both the Courts below, the Punjab Labour\nAppellate Tribunal (“Appellate Tribunal”), dated 19.09.2011, and the\nPunjab Labour Court, Faisalabad (“Labour Court”), dated 19.06.2010,\nwere modified by the learned Single Judge of the High Court with the\n\nobservation that the Appellant shall retire from the service of Allied Bank\n\nCivil Appeals No.836-L, 837-L/2013 2\n\nLimited, (“Respondent Bank”), compulsorily with effect from the date of\nher dismissal.\n\n2. Briefly, the facts necessary to decide the matter before us are that\nthe Appellant joined the Respondent Bank as Assistant in the year 1979.\nShe was promoted as Officer Grade-III in 1986 and Officer Grade-II in\n1995. On 11.04.2007, the Appellant was transferred to the Allied Bank\nSamundri Road Branch, Faisalabad (“Branch”). It was at this Branch of\nthe Respondent Bank, where she was suspended and charge sheeted, on\n19.10.2007, with the allegation of being privy to a fraud. Subsequently,\nInquiry Proceedings were initiated against her and the Inquiry Officer,\nvide report dated 25.01.2008, concluded that the charges against the\nAppellant stood partially proved. Consequently, vide letter dated\n07.05.2008, the Respondent Bank imposed a major penalty on the\nAppellant and dismissed her from service.\n\n3. Being aggrieved the Appellant filed a grievance petition before the\nLabour Court, which vide judgment, dated 19.06.2010, re-instated her in\nthe Respondent Bank’s service albeit with a lower Grade, and declined to\naward her any back benefits. Being dissatisfied with the Order, both the\nAppellant and the Respondent Bank filed Appeals before the Appellate\nTribunal, which vide its consolidated judgment, dated 19.09.2011,\ndismissed both the appeals and upheld the Order of the Labour Court.\nSubsequently, both the Appellant and the Respondent Bank filed Writ\nPetitions before the Lahore High Court, which were disposed of in the\nfollowing terms:\n\n“In. the instant case though the connivance of the\naccused/petitioner with the main accused/Shaukat Naeem\nWarraich in the commission of the fraud/misappropriation is not\nproved from the evidence available on the record, but her failure to\ndischarge her duties diligently is proved from the documentary\nevidence brought on the record and in view of the settled principle\nof law that a ‘man can tell a lie but a document not’, she has\nrightly been held ‘negligent’. However, keeping in view her length\nof service, spreading over 28 years, and unblemished past career,\nher dismissal from service would be a harsh punishment.\nSimilarly, re-instatement into service though with reduction of\nGrade would also not be justified in the facts and circumstances\n\nCivil Appeals No.836-L, 837-L/2013 3\n\nof the case as re-instatement of the petitioner would amount to\n\nforce the employer to take back a “negligent” employee in its\n\ninstitution, which has already sustained heavy loss at the hands\n\nof the said employee. So in my view compulsory retirement of the\n\npetitioner in the given circumstances would foster the interest of\n\njustice.”\n4. The main allegation for imposing a major penalty on the Appellant\nand her subsequent dismissal from service was that she had been\nnegligent in performing her duties by disclosing the secret code to her\nformer Bank Manager, namely Shoukat Naeem Warraich, who defrauded\nthe Bank and misappropriated hefty amounts, in his capacity as the\nManager of the Branch. During the Inquiry Proceedings, the Appellant\nrefuted all the charges leveled upon her. The Labour Court after\nexamining all of those aspects concluded, through Order dated\n19.06.2010, that there was no direct allegation against her with regard to\nembezzlement, preparation of any fabricated instrument, and using the\nsame for her own benefit. However, the Court opined that she had been\nnegligent and careless in performing her duty and thus reinstated her\nwithout back benefits, in a lower grade i.e. Grade-III rather than Grade-\nIl. The aforementioned Order was upheld by the Appellate Tribunal vide\nOrder dated 19.2.2011. In the Petitions filed by the present Appellant\nand the present Respondent Bank before the Lahore High Court, Lahore,\nthe High Court, vide Impugned Judgement dated 16.01.2013, observed\nthat the Appellant’s negligence demanded that she be compulsory retired\ninstead of being re-instated.\n5. We have heard the Appellant, who is appearing in-person, and the\nlearned counsel for the Respondent Bank and have perused the record\nwith their assistance. Upon careful consideration of the matter, we have\nfound that the Impugned Judgement of the High Court is contrary to the\nprinciples of justice. Perusal of the Impugned Judgement of the High\n\nCourt reveals that it appears to be self-contradictory as the High Court\n\nhas first observed that the Appellant has an unblemished past career,\n\nCivil Appeals No.836-L, 837-L/2013 4\n\nspanning over 28 years, and that her dismissal from service would be a\nharsh punishment; and yet, the High Court found it appropriate to then\nobserve that the Appellant be compulsory retired from service. In our\nview these observations of the High Court in fact defeat the ends of\njustice rather than fostering the same, as awarding compulsory\nretirement would be equivalent to meting out harsh treatment to her.\n\n6. It is a settled proposition of law that a penalty should be\nproportionate to the guilt. The modern notion of proportionality requires\nthat the punishment ought to reflect the degree of moral culpability\nassociated with the offence for which it is imposed.! Given the fact that\nthe Labour Court and the Appellate Tribunal found the Appellant\nnegligent of not properly keeping the secret code but did not see any\nmerit in the allegations of embezzlement, the imposition of a major\npenalty of compulsory retirement from service would definitely be harsh.\n7. In Saifullah ? this Court has observed:\n\n“6. We have heard the learned Counsel for the parties and\nhave also perused the available record as well as the judgment\nof the Tribunal. Admittedly there is no allegation against the\nappellant of having embezzled any amount and on the\ncontrary, there is admission on the part of his co-accused\nMuhammad Tariq regarding the said embezzled amount which\nhe had admitted and promised to return in part payments on\ntwo different dates. In the given circumstances and in the\nabsence of any substantial and cogent evidence placing the\nappellant to be in collusion with Muhammad Tariq co-accused\nand particularly when there is an admission of the said guilt\non his part alone, would not be fair and justifiable. At the most\nthe failure of the appellant to get signatures in hand to hand\ncash book could have been considered to be a lapse on his part\nwhich could not entail the major penalty of removal from\nservice resulting in his compulsory retirement rather fall\nwithin the parameter of inefficiency on the part of the\nappellant. Punishment should always commensurate with the\nguilt proved. We have observed that in the circumstances, case\nagainst the appellant cannot be considered to be of fraud,\nforgery or embezzlement rather at the most it can be\nconsidered to be that of inefficiency.\n\n7. In the light of the above, we while partially allowing this\nappeal convert the punishment of compulsory retirement of the\nappellant to that of stoppage of five years increments following\nhis reinstatement in service. However, no back benefits are\ngranted to the appellant.”\n\n1 Divisional Superintendent, Postal Services v. Nadeem Raza (2023 SCMR 803)\n2 Saifullah v. Divisional Superintendent, Postal Services (2016 SCMR 1430)\n\nCivil Appeals No.836-L, 837-L/2013 5\n\n8. In the decision rendered in Auditor-General of Pakistan ? this Court\nheld:\n\n“The element of bad faith and willfulness may bring an act of\nnegligence within the purview of misconduct but lack of proper\ncare and vigilance may not always be willful to make it a case\nof grave negligence inviting service punishment. The\nphilosophy of punishment is based on the concept of\nretribution, which may be either through the method of\ndeterrence or reformation. The purpose of deterrent\npunishment is not only to maintain balance with the gravity of\nwrong done by a person but also to make an example for\nothers as a preventive measure for reformation of the society,\nwhereas the concept of minor punishment in the law is to\nmake an attempt to reform the individual wrong doer. In\nservice matters, the extreme penalty for minor acts depriving a\nperson from right of earning would definitely defeat the\nreformatory concept of punishment in administration of\njustice. In view thereof, we would not take any exception to the\nview of the matter taken by the Tribunal.”\n\n9. We, therefore, under the circumstances, partly allow the Appeal\nfiled by the Appellant by setting aside the Impugned Judgement of the\nHigh Court dated 16.01.2013, and up hold those of the Labour Court\nand Appellate Tribunal to the extent of the demotion to a lower grade;\nwith the modification that the Appellant will be entitled to all back\nbenefits as available to a Grade-III Officer, from the date of her dismissal\nto the date of her retirement. She will also be entitled to all the\npensionary benefits as available to the said Grade Officer.\n\n10. C. A. No.837-L/2013: Since, we have partly allowed the present\n\nAppeal, No. 836-L/2013, this Appeal filed by the Respondent Bank,\n\nstands dismissed.

Briefly, the facts necessary to decide the matter before us are that the Appellant joined the Respondent Bank as Assistant in the year 1979. She was promoted as Officer Grade-III in 1986 and Officer Grade-II in 1995. On 11.04.2007, the Appellant was transferred to the Allied Bank Samundri Road Branch, Faisalabad Branch .

Consequently, vide letter dated 07.05.2008, the Respondent Bank imposed a major penalty on the Appellant and dismissed her from service. 3. Being aggrieved the Appellant filed a grievance petition before the Labour Court, which vide judgment, dated 19.06.2010, re-instated her in the Respondent Bank s service albeit with a lower Grade, and declined to award her any back benefits. Being dissatisfied with the Order, both the Appellant and the Respondent Bank filed Appeals before the Appellate Tribunal, which vide its consolidated judgment, dated 19.09.2011, dismissed both the appeals and upheld the Order of the Labour Court. Subsequently, both the Appellant and the Respondent Bank filed Writ Petitions before the Lahore High Court, which were disposed of in the following terms: In. the instant case though the connivance of the accused/petitioner with the main accused/Shaukat Naeem Warraich in the commission of the fraud/misappropriation is not proved from the evidence available on the record, but her failure to discharge her duties diligently is proved from the documentary evidence brought on the record and in view of the settled principle of law that a man can tell a lie but a document not , she has rightly been held negligent . However, keeping in view her length of service, spreading over 28 years, and unblemished past career, her dismissal from service would be a harsh punishment. Similarly, re-instatement into service though with reduction of Grade would also not be justified in the facts and circumstances Civil Appeals No.836-L, 837-L/2013 3 of the case as re-instatement of the petitioner would amount to force the employer to take back a negligent employee in its institution, which has already sustained heavy loss at the hands of the said employee. So in my view compulsory retirement of the petitioner in the given circumstances would foster the interest of justice. 4. The main allegation for imposing a major penalty on the Appellant and her subsequent dismissal from service was that she had been negligent in performing her duties by disclosing the secret code to her former Bank Manager, namely Shoukat Naeem Warraich, who defrauded the Bank and misappropriated hefty amounts, in his capacity as the Manager of the Branch.

The aforementioned Order was upheld by the Appellate Tribunal vide Order dated 19.2.2011. In the Petitions filed by the present Appellant and the present Respondent Bank before the Lahore High Court, Lahore, the High Court, vide Impugned Judgement dated 16.01.2013, observed that the Appellant s negligence demanded that she be compulsory retired instead of being re-instated. 5. We have heard the Appellant, who is appearing in-person, and the learned counsel for the Respondent Bank and have perused the record with their assistance. Upon careful consideration of the matter, we have found that the Impugned Judgement of the High Court is contrary to the principles of justice. Perusal of the Impugned Judgement of the High Court reveals that it appears to be self-contradictory as the High Court has first observed that the Appellant has an unblemished past career, Civil Appeals No.836-L, 837-L/2013 4 spanning over 28 years, and that her dismissal from service would be a harsh punishment; and yet, the High Court found it appropriate to then observe that the Appellant be compulsory retired from service. In our view these observations of the High Court in fact defeat the ends of justice rather than fostering the same, as awarding compulsory retirement would be equivalent to meting out harsh treatment to her. 6. It is a settled proposition of law that a penalty should be proportionate to the guilt.

Admittedly there is no allegation against the appellant of having embezzled any amount and on the contrary, there is admission on the part of his co-accused Muhammad Tariq regarding the said embezzled amount which he had admitted and promised to return in part payments on two different dates. In the given circumstances and in the absence of any substantial and cogent evidence placing the appellant to be in collusion with Muhammad Tariq co-accused and particularly when there is an admission of the said guilt on his part alone, would not be fair and justifiable. At the most the failure of the appellant to get signatures in hand to hand cash book could have been considered to be a lapse on his part which could not entail the major penalty of removal from service resulting in his compulsory retirement rather fall within the parameter of inefficiency on the part of the appellant. Punishment should always commensurate with the guilt proved. We have observed that in the circumstances, case against the appellant cannot be considered to be of fraud, forgery or embezzlement rather at the most it can be considered to be that of inefficiency. 7. In the light of the above, we while partially allowing this appeal convert the punishment of compulsory retirement of the appellant to that of stoppage of five years increments following his reinstatement in service. However, no back benefits are granted to the appellant. 1 Divisional Superintendent, Postal Services v. Nadeem Raza 2023 SCMR 803 2 Saifullah v. Divisional Superintendent, Postal Services 2016 SCMR 1430 Civil Appeals No.836-L, 837-L/2013 5 8. In the decision rendered in Auditor-General of Pakistan ? this Court held: The element of bad faith and willfulness may bring an act of negligence within the purview of misconduct but lack of proper care and vigilance may not always be willful to make it a case of grave negligence inviting service punishment. The philosophy of punishment is based on the concept of retribution, which may be either through the method of deterrence or reformation. The purpose of deterrent punishment is not only to maintain balance with the gravity of wrong done by a person but also to make an example for others as a preventive measure for reformation of the society, whereas the concept of minor punishment in the law is to make an attempt to reform the individual wrong doer. In service matters, the extreme penalty for minor acts depriving a person from right of earning would definitely defeat the reformatory concept of punishment in administration of justice. In view thereof, we would not take any exception to the view of the matter taken by the Tribunal. 9. We, therefore, under the circumstances, partly allow the Appeal filed by the Appellant by setting aside the Impugned Judgement of the High Court dated 16.01.2013, and up hold those of the Labour Court and Appellate Tribunal to the extent of the demotion to a lower grade; with the modification that the Appellant will be entitled to all back benefits as available to a Grade-III Officer, from the date of her dismissal to the date of her retirement. She will also be entitled to all the pensionary benefits as available to the said Grade Officer. 10. C. A. No.837-L/2013: Since, we have partly allowed the present Appeal, No. 836-L/2013, this Appeal filed by the Respondent Bank, stands dismissed. The parties are left to bear their own cost.

keeping in view her length of service, spreading over 28 years, and unblemished past career, her dismissal from service would be a harsh punishment.", "Similarly, re-instatement into service though with reduction of Grade would also not be justified in the facts and circumstances Civil Appeals No.836-L, 837-L/2013 3 of the case as re-instatement of the petitioner would amount to force the employer to take back a negligent employee in its institution, which has already sustained heavy loss at the hands of the said employee.", "So in my view compulsory retirement of the petitioner in the

modern notion of proportionality requires that the punishment ought to reflect the degree of moral culpability associated with the offence for which it is imposed.!", "Given the fact that the Labour

Amir Rehman, Addl. AGP.\nAssisted by: Muhammad Hassan Ali, Law Clerk.\n\nDate of Hearing: 24.02.2023\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nSyed Mansoor Ali Shah, J.- Through the instant appeal,\n\nthe appellant has challenged judgment dated 16.8.2013 passed by the\nHigh Court of Sindh, Karachi, whereby the constitutional petition filed\n\nby the respondents was allowed.\n\n2. The brief facts of the case are that respondents No. 2 to 8,\nbeing private broadcasters owning and operating different television\nchannels, were issued various show cause notices in 2010 by the\nappellant/PEMRA, demanding payment of surcharge on account of late\npayment of annual fee pertaining to the licences granted to the\n\nrespondents by the appellant. The said surcharge claimed by the\n\nCA. 1518/2013\n2\n\nappellant was under Regulation No. 9(5) of the PEMRA (TV/Radio\nBroadcast Operations) Regulations, 2002 (“2002 Regulations”). The\nrespondents challenged the vires of the said surcharge by filling a\nconstitutional petition before the High Court. Through the impugned\njudgment dated 12.09.2013, the constitutional petition was allowed and\nthe demand for payment of said surcharge under the 2002 Regulations\nwas in effect declared to be ultra vires to the Pakistan Electronic Media\nRegulatory Authority Ordinance, 2002 (“Ordinance”), and resultantly,\n\nthe show cause notices demanding the same were set aside.\n\n3. Leave to appeal was granted by this Court vide order dated\n19.11.2013 in the following terms:-\n\n‘It is argued that the view set out by the learned High\nCourt in the impugned judgment that the levy of surcharge\nvide Regulation 9(5) of the PEMRA (TV/Radio Broadcast\nOperations) Regulations, 2002 is beyond the scope of the\nprovisions of Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory\nAuthority Ordinance, 2002 (the Ordinance, 2002) and thus\nultra vires is not in consonance with the provisions of\nSection 24(5) of the Ordinance, 2002 read with Section 29-\nA of the Ordinance, 2002. Leave is granted to consider the\n\nabove.”\n\n4. While arguing the matter, the learned counsel for the\nappellant took us through the scheme of the Ordinance, particularly\nreferring to Sections 2(s), 4(3), 24(4), 24(5), 29-A, 30(1)(a) and 39 of the\nOrdinance. He also referred to the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory\nAuthority (PEMRA) Rules, 2002 (“2002 Rules”) and the Pakistan\nElectronic Media Regulatory Authority Rules, 2009 (“2009 Rules”), as\nwell as to two sets of Regulations; the 2002 Regulations and the\nPakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Television Broadcast\nStation Operations Regulations, 2012) (“2012 Regulations”). While\nreferring to the above, the main plank of the arguments of the learned\ncounsel for the appellant was that the surcharge provided under the\n2002 Regulations was sanctioned by the Ordinance through Sections\n29-A and 30(1)(a), being described as “other charges”. While explaining\nthe legality of the 2002 Regulations, he submitted that initially the 2002\nRegulations were promulgated under the 2002 Rules made under the\nOrdinance, thereafter, an amendment was brought about in Section 4 of\n\nthe Ordinance through the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory\n\nCA. 1518/2013\n3\n\nAuthority (Amendment) Act, 2007 (‘Amendment Act of 2007”),\nauthorizing PEMRA to make Regulations for carrying out the purposes\nof the Ordinance. Under the said provision, regulations were then\nissued for the first time in the year 2012 i.e. the 2012 Regulations.\nTherefore, he argued that the demand for surcharge was valid as the\nsame had the sanctity of the law. Further, the learned Additional\nAttorney General for Pakistan submitted that the said surcharge could\nbe treated as compensation for late payment of annual fee which could\n\nbe charged by PEMRA under Section 19(4) of the Ordinance.\n\n5. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondents\nsupported the judgment of the High Court and vehemently reiterated\nthat the 2002 Regulations did not have the sanction of the law; they\ncould not have been issued under the 2002 Rules without any\nsubstantive sanction under the Ordinance; the Ordinance did not\nprovide for any power to demand surcharge on late payment of annual\nfee, therefore, Regulation 9(5) of the 2002 Regulations, being beyond the\nscope of the Ordinance, was ultra vires to the Ordinance; and that even\nif Regulation 9(5) of the 2002 Regulations is taken on its face value, it\nonly provides for late payment surcharge on licence fee or renewal fee\nand does not provide for any sanction for demanding surcharge with\n\nregards to late payment of annual fee.\n\n6. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and the\nlearned Additional Attorney General for Pakistan, and have also\nexamined the record with their able assistance. The question before us\npertains to whether the demand of payment of surcharge under\nRegulation 9(5) of the 2002 Regulations, through the show cause\nnotices issued to the respondents pertaining to the years 2004 to 2011,\nwas valid under the law. In order to dilate upon the said question, it will\nhave to be ascertained whether the 2002 Regulations were legally\nissued under the Ordinance and whether the Ordinance provides for\nany power to levy and recover surcharge on late payment of annual fee\n\nwith or without the 2002 Regulations.\n\n7. It is an admitted position that the Ordinance before it was\namended through the Amendment Act of 2007 neither had any\nprovision empowering PEMRA to issue regulations thereunder and nor\nany power to impose surcharge on account of late payment of annual\n\nfee was provided therein. By virtue of Section 39, the Ordinance only\n\nCA. 1518/2013\n4\n\nempowered PEMRA to make rules with the approval of the Government\nand by notification in the official Gazette. The 2002 Rules were then\npromulgated under the said provision. Rule 30 of the 2002 Rules\nprovided for the power to issue regulations and by exercising the same,\nthe 2002 Regulations were issued by PEMRA, which, through\nRegulation 9(5), provided for the imposition of surcharge for ‘ate\npayment of the licence or renewal fee’. Subsequently, through the\nAmendment Act of 2007, Section 4 of the Ordinance was substituted\nand the new Section 4 provided that, by notification in the official\nGazette, the Authority i.e. PEMRA! may make regulations and also\nissue determinations for carrying out the purposes of the Ordinance.\nNotably, the Amendment Act of 2007 was not given retroactive effect\nand no validation clause was provided in the Amendment Act of 2007 to\nvalidate or save the proceedings initiated or actions undertaken under\nthe 2002 Regulations. Furthermore, no express provision to impose\nsurcharge was provided in the Amendment Act of 2007 either. It,\nhowever, added a new provision i.e. Section 29-A into the Ordinance\nwhich caters to recovery of dues, including any other charges, as\narrears of land revenue. It also substituted Section 30 of the Ordinance,\nwhich, through Section 30(1)(a), now provides that PEMRA may revoke\nand suspend any licence if the licensee fails to pay the licence fee,\nannual renewal fee or any other charges including fine, if any. The term\n\n“other charges”, however, has not been defined therein.\n\n8. Thereafter, the 2009 Rules were promulgated under the\nOrdinance, repealing the 2002 Rules. However, still no regulations were\nmade under the Ordinance after the express power to make the same\nwas added into the Ordinance through the Amendment Act of 2007, as\nnoted above. The 2002 Regulations, made under the 2002 Rules, were\nstill applied by PEMRA and the show cause notices, pertaining to the\nyears 2004 to 2011, demanding payment of surcharge were issued to\nthe respondents under Regulation 9(5) of the said 2002 Regulations.\nThereafter, as admitted by the learned counsel for the appellant, the\n2012 Regulations, as notified in the official Gazette, were issued under\n\nthe Ordinance for the first time in the year 2012.\n\n9. It is apparent from the above that the Ordinance before it\n\nwas amended by the Amendment Act of 2007 did not provide for any\n\n1 See Section 2(b) of the Ordinance.\n\nCA. 1518/2013\n5\n\npower to PEMRA to issue regulations. It only provided for the power to\nmake rules under Section 39 of the Ordinance, which was exercised by\nmaking the 2002 Rules. Through the said 2002 Rules, without any\nsuch power to the said effect in the Ordinance, the power to make\nregulations was extended to PEMRA through Rule 30 of the 2002 Rules.\nThe 2002 Regulations were then issued under said Rule 30 of the 2002\nRules. Thereafter, the Ordinance was amended through the Amendment\nAct of 2007 and the power to make regulations under the Ordinance\nwas specifically added into the Ordinance by substituting Section 4 of\nthe Ordinance. However, the Amendment Act of 2007 was not given\nretroactive effect and did not contain any provision validating the 2002\nRegulations.2 We have also noted that the amended Section 4 of the\nOrdinance authorized PEMRA to make regulations by notification in the\nofficial Gazette, however, the 2002 Regulations were not notified in the\nofficial Gazette, as admitted by the appellant in its para-wise comments\nfiled before the High Court.? Therefore, the Amendment Act of 2007 did\nnot extend any legal cover to the 2002 Regulations. The 2002\nRegulations, which were made under the 2002 Rules without any such\npower provided in the Ordinance, remained operative till 2012 i.e. when\nthe 2012 Regulations were issued for the first time under the amended\nOrdinance. Therefore, the 2002 Regulations did not derive their power\nfrom the parent statute i.e. the Ordinance and, even after the Ordinance\nwas amended, remained non est. They were made under Rule 30 of the\n2002 Rules which was beyond the scope of the Ordinance. It is settled\nlaw that the rules made under a parent statute cannot go beyond the\nscope of the said statute and nor can they enlarge the scope of the\nstatutory provisions therein. The power of rule-making is an incidental\npower that must follow and not run parallel to the parent statute.\nFurthermore, regulations must be made by the authority of the parent\nstatute and regulations that do not draw their power from the parent\nstatute are also ultra vires to the said parent statute.* Therefore, Rule\n30 of the 2002 Rules, going beyond the scope of the Ordinance, was\n\nultra vires to the Ordinance and the 2002 Regulations were void ab\n\n2 See Molasses Trading v.

Even otherwise, without prejudice to the above, the\nOrdinance as it stood before it was amended through the Amendment\nAct of 2007 and as it stands after it has been amended through the\nAmendment Act of 2007, there was and is no specific provision that\nempowers PEMRA to impose a surcharge on the late payment of annual\nfee. The Ordinance only contemplates the levy of a licence fee and\nannual fee but does not empower PEMRA to levy any surcharge over\nand above the annual fee.° The contention of the learned counsel for the\nappellant that after the Ordinance was amended through the\nAmendment Act of 2007, the power to levy and recover surcharge was\nincluded in the term “other charges” as appearing in Sections 29-A and\n30(1)(a), is without any force. It is trite law that fiscal statutes are to be\ninterpreted strictly and there is no room for any intendment therein.® It\nis underlined that despite the Ordinance being amended through the\nAmendment Act of 2007, the power to levy and recover surcharge was\nstill not provided therein by the legislature. Even otherwise, Section 29-\nA of the Ordinance only caters to recovery of dues as arrears of land\nrevenue and Section 30(1) provides that PEMRA may revoke or suspend\na licence on one or more of the grounds mentioned therein, including,\nas stipulated under Section 30(1)(a), if the licensee fails to pay the\nlicence fee, annual renewal fee or any other charges including any fine,\nif any. Therefore, it is apparent that there is no definition of “other\ncharges” under the Ordinance and no specific charging provision\nwhereby the “other charges” are levied on a licensee or any provision\nthat empowers PEMRA to levy and recover surcharge even as “other\n\ncharges”.\n\n11. Reliance on Section 19(4) of the Ordinance by the learned\nAdditional Attorney General of Pakistan is also misplaced as the said\nprovision only empowers PEMRA to charge fee as it may fix from time to\ntime for the grant of a licence and for its annual renewal but does not\nprovide for the power to levy and recover surcharge on non-payment of\n\nannual fee. Section 19(3) provides that every licence shall be subject to\n\n5 See Sections 19(4) and 24(4) of the Ordinance.\n\n6 Hirjina and Co. v. Commissioner of Sales Tax, 1971 SCMR 128; Star Textile v.\nGovernment of Sindh, 2002 SCMR 356; Pearl Continental Hotel v. Government of\nNWFP, PLD 2010 SC 1004; The Commissioner Inland Revenue v. Kohinoor Sugar\nMills, 2021 SCMR 536.\n\nCA. 1518/2013\n7\n\nsuch terms and conditions as may be prescribed. Section 24(4) of the\nOrdinance provides that a licence shall be valid for a period of five, ten\nor fifteen years subject to payment of the annual fee prescribed from\ntime to time. Section 24(5) provides that the Authority may renew a\nlicence on such terms and conditions as may be prescribed. Although,\nthrough the Amendment Act of 2007, Section 2(s) was amended and the\ndefinition of “prescribed” was expanded to include as “prescribed by the\nrules or regulations made by the Authority”, however, as held above, the\n2002 Regulations were void ab initio and remained non est. As such,\nthere were no valid regulations in the field for the purposes of Sections\n2(s), 19(3), 24(4) or 24(5) of the Ordinance up till the 2012 Regulations\nwere issued. Thus, the demand of surcharge under Regulation 9(5) of\nthe 2002 Regulations was ultra vires to the Ordinance which does not\n\nconfer any power on PEMRA to impose and recover such a surcharge.’\n\n12. Even otherwise, we have also noted that Regulation 9(5) of\nthe 2002 Regulations provided that the surcharge would be incurred\nupon the late payment of the licence or the renewal fee but did not\nprovide that surcharge could be imposed on late payment of annual fee.\nTherefore, even under Regulation 9(5), the demand of surcharge on late\n\npayment of annual fee was without any lawful authority.\n\n13. In view of what has been held above, we see no reason to\ninterfere in the well-reasoned judgment of the High Court. The instant\n\nappeal is therefore, dismissed accordingly.\n\nJudge\nJudge\nIslamabad,\n24th February, 2023.\nApproved for reporting\nSadaqat\nJudge\n\n7 Province of Sindh v.

Through the impugned judgment dated 12.09.2013, the constitutional petition was allowed and the demand for payment of said surcharge under the 2002 Regulations was in effect declared to be ultra vires to the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority Ordinance, 2002 Ordinance , and resultantly, the show cause notices demanding the same were set aside. 3. Leave to appeal was granted by this Court vide order dated 19.11.2013 in the following terms:- It is argued that the view set out by the learned High Court in the impugned judgment that the levy of surcharge vide Regulation 9 5 of the PEMRA TV/Radio Broadcast Operations Regulations, 2002 is beyond the scope of the provisions of Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority Ordinance, 2002 the Ordinance, 2002 and thus ultra vires is not in consonance with the provisions of Section 24 5 of the Ordinance, 2002 read with Section 29A of the Ordinance, 2002. Leave is granted to consider the above. 4. While arguing the matter, the learned counsel for the appellant took us through the scheme of the Ordinance, particularly referring to Sections 2 s , 4 3 , 24 4 , 24 5 , 29-A, 30 1 a and 39 of the Ordinance. He also referred to the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority PEMRA Rules, 2002 2002 Rules and the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority Rules, 2009 2009 Rules , as well as to two sets of Regulations; the 2002 Regulations and the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority Television Broadcast Station Operations Regulations, 2012 2012 Regulations . While referring to the above, the main plank of the arguments of the learned counsel for the appellant was that the surcharge provided under the 2002 Regulations was sanctioned by the Ordinance through Sections 29-A and 30 1 a , being described as other charges . While explaining the legality of the 2002 Regulations, he submitted that initially the 2002 Regulations were promulgated under the 2002 Rules made under the Ordinance, thereafter, an amendment was brought about in Section 4 of the Ordinance through the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory CA. 1518/2013 3 Authority Amendment Act, 2007 Amendment Act of 2007 , authorizing PEMRA to make Regulations for carrying out the purposes of the Ordinance. Under the said provision, regulations were then issued for the first time in the year 2012 i.e. the 2012 Regulations. Therefore, he argued that the demand for surcharge was valid as the same had the sanctity of the law. Further, the learned Additional Attorney General for Pakistan submitted that the said surcharge could be treated as compensation for late payment of annual fee which could be charged by PEMRA under Section 19 4 of the Ordinance. 5. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondents supported the judgment of the High Court and vehemently reiterated that the 2002 Regulations did not have the sanction of the law; they could not have been issued under the 2002 Rules without any substantive sanction under the Ordinance; the Ordinance did not provide for any power to demand surcharge on late payment of annual fee, therefore, Regulation 9 5 of the 2002 Regulations, being beyond the scope of the Ordinance, was ultra vires to the Ordinance; and that even if Regulation 9 5 of the 2002 Regulations is taken on its face value, it only provides for late payment surcharge on licence fee or renewal fee and does not provide for any sanction for demanding surcharge with regards to late payment of annual fee. 6. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and the learned Additional Attorney General for Pakistan, and have also examined the record with their able assistance. The question before us pertains to whether the demand of payment of surcharge under Regulation 9 5 of the 2002 Regulations, through the show cause notices issued to the respondents pertaining to the years 2004 to 2011, was valid under the law. In order to dilate upon the said question, it will have to be ascertained whether the 2002 Regulations were legally issued under the Ordinance and whether the Ordinance provides for any power to levy and recover surcharge on late payment of annual fee with or without the 2002 Regulations. 7. It is an admitted position that the Ordinance before it was amended through the Amendment Act of 2007 neither had any provision empowering PEMRA to issue regulations thereunder and nor any power to impose surcharge on account of late payment of annual fee was provided therein. By virtue of Section 39, the Ordinance only CA. 1518/2013 4 empowered PEMRA to make rules with the approval of the Government and by notification in the official Gazette. The 2002 Rules were then promulgated under the said provision. Rule 30 of the 2002 Rules provided for the power to issue regulations and by exercising the same, the 2002 Regulations were issued by PEMRA, which, through Regulation 9 5 , provided for the imposition of surcharge for ate payment of the licence or renewal fee . Subsequently, through the Amendment Act of 2007, Section 4 of the Ordinance was substituted and the new Section 4 provided that, by notification in the official Gazette, the Authority i.e. PEMRA! may make regulations and also issue determinations for carrying out the purposes of the Ordinance. Notably, the Amendment Act of 2007 was not given retroactive effect and no validation clause was provided in the Amendment Act of 2007 to validate or save the proceedings initiated or actions undertaken under the 2002 Regulations. Furthermore, no express provision to impose surcharge was provided in the Amendment Act of 2007 either. It, however, added a new provision i.e. Section 29-A into the Ordinance which caters to recovery of dues, including any other charges, as arrears of land revenue. It also substituted Section 30 of the Ordinance, which, through Section 30 1 a , now provides that PEMRA may revoke and suspend any licence if the licensee fails to pay the licence fee, annual renewal fee or any other charges including fine, if any. The term other charges , however, has not been defined therein. 8. Thereafter, the 2009 Rules were promulgated under the Ordinance, repealing the 2002 Rules. However, still no regulations were made under the Ordinance after the express power to make the same was added into the Ordinance through the Amendment Act of 2007, as noted above. The 2002 Regulations, made under the 2002 Rules, were still applied by PEMRA and the show cause notices, pertaining to the years 2004 to 2011, demanding payment of surcharge were issued to the respondents under Regulation 9 5 of the said 2002 Regulations. Thereafter, as admitted by the learned counsel for the appellant, the 2012 Regulations, as notified in the official Gazette, were issued under the Ordinance for the first time in the year 2012. 9. It is apparent from the above that the Ordinance before it was amended by the Amendment Act of 2007 did not provide for any 1 See Section 2 b of the Ordinance. CA. 1518/2013 5 power to PEMRA to issue regulations. It only provided for the power to make rules under Section 39 of the Ordinance, which was exercised by making the 2002 Rules. Through the said 2002 Rules, without any such power to the said effect in the Ordinance, the power to make regulations was extended to PEMRA through Rule 30 of the 2002 Rules. The 2002 Regulations were then issued under said Rule 30 of the 2002 Rules. Thereafter, the Ordinance was amended through the Amendment Act of 2007 and the power to make regulations under the Ordinance was specifically added into the Ordinance by substituting Section 4 of the Ordinance. However, the Amendment Act of 2007 was not given retroactive effect and did not contain any provision validating the 2002 Regulations.2 We have also noted that the amended Section 4 of the Ordinance authorized PEMRA to make regulations by notification in the official Gazette, however, the 2002 Regulations were not notified in the official Gazette, as admitted by the appellant in its para-wise comments filed before the High Court.? Therefore, the Amendment Act of 2007 did not extend any legal cover to the 2002 Regulations. The 2002 Regulations, which were made under the 2002 Rules without any such power provided in the Ordinance, remained operative till 2012 i.e. when the 2012 Regulations were issued for the first time under the amended Ordinance. Therefore, the 2002 Regulations did not derive their power from the parent statute i.e. the Ordinance and, even after the Ordinance was amended, remained non est. They were made under Rule 30 of the 2002 Rules which was beyond the scope of the Ordinance. It is settled law that the rules made under a parent statute cannot go beyond the scope of the said statute and nor can they enlarge the scope of the statutory provisions therein. The power of rule-making is an incidental power that must follow and not run parallel to the parent statute. Furthermore, regulations must be made by the authority of the parent statute and regulations that do not draw their power from the parent statute are also ultra vires to the said parent statute. Therefore, Rule 30 of the 2002 Rules, going beyond the scope of the Ordinance, was ultra vires to the Ordinance and the 2002 Regulations were void ab 2 See Molasses Trading v. Federation of Pakistan, 1993 SCMR 1905; Star Textile v. Government of Sindh, 2002 SCMR 356. 3 Para 24 of the para-wise comments. 4 See Jurists Foundation v. Federal Government, PLD 2020 SC 1; Zarai Taraqiati Bank v. Said Rehman, 2013 PLC CS 1223; Suo Motu Case No. 11 of 2011, PLD 2014 SC 389; Suo Motu Case No. 13 of 2009, PLD 2011 SC 619; Farrukh Raza Sheikh v. The Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue, 2022 SCMR 1787. CA. 1518/2013 6 initio, having been made without any lawful authority, and hence, of no legal effect. 10. Even otherwise, without prejudice to the above, the Ordinance as it stood before it was amended through the Amendment Act of 2007 and as it stands after it has been amended through the Amendment Act of 2007, there was and is no specific provision that empowers PEMRA to impose a surcharge on the late payment of annual fee. The Ordinance only contemplates the levy of a licence fee and annual fee but does not empower PEMRA to levy any surcharge over and above the annual fee. The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that after the Ordinance was amended through the Amendment Act of 2007, the power to levy and recover surcharge was included in the term other charges as appearing in Sections 29-A and 30 1 a , is without any force. It is trite law that fiscal statutes are to be interpreted strictly and there is no room for any intendment therein. It is underlined that despite the Ordinance being amended through the Amendment Act of 2007, the power to levy and recover surcharge was still not provided therein by the legislature. Even otherwise, Section 29A of the Ordinance only caters to recovery of dues as arrears of land revenue and Section 30 1 provides that PEMRA may revoke or suspend a licence on one or more of the grounds mentioned therein, including, as stipulated under Section 30 1 a , if the licensee fails to pay the licence fee, annual renewal fee or any other charges including any fine, if any. Therefore, it is apparent that there is no definition of other charges under the Ordinance and no specific charging provision whereby the other charges are levied on a licensee or any provision that empowers PEMRA to levy and recover surcharge even as other charges . 11. Reliance on Section 19 4 of the Ordinance by the learned Additional Attorney General of Pakistan is also misplaced as the said provision only empowers PEMRA to charge fee as it may fix from time to time for the grant of a licence and for its annual renewal but does not provide for the power to levy and recover surcharge on non-payment of annual fee. Section 19 3 provides that every licence shall be subject to 5 See Sections 19 4 and 24 4 of the Ordinance. 6 Hirjina and Co. v. Commissioner of Sales Tax, 1971 SCMR 128; Star Textile v. Government of Sindh, 2002 SCMR 356; Pearl Continental Hotel v. Government of NWFP, PLD 2010 SC 1004; The Commissioner Inland Revenue v. Kohinoor Sugar Mills, 2021 SCMR 536. CA. 1518/2013 7 such terms and conditions as may be prescribed. Section 24 4 of the Ordinance provides that a licence shall be valid for a period of five, ten or fifteen years subject to payment of the annual fee prescribed from time to time. Section 24 5 provides that the Authority may renew a licence on such terms and conditions as may be prescribed. Although, through the Amendment Act of 2007, Section 2 s was amended and the definition of prescribed was expanded to include as prescribed by the rules or regulations made by the Authority , however, as held above, the 2002 Regulations were void ab initio and remained non est. As such, there were no valid regulations in the field for the purposes of Sections 2 s , 19 3 , 24 4 or 24 5 of the Ordinance up till the 2012 Regulations were issued. Thus, the demand of surcharge under Regulation 9 5 of the 2002 Regulations was ultra vires to the Ordinance which does not confer any power on PEMRA to impose and recover such a surcharge. 12. Even otherwise, we have also noted that Regulation 9 5 of the 2002 Regulations provided that the surcharge would be incurred upon the late payment of the licence or the renewal fee but did not provide that surcharge could be imposed on late payment of annual fee. Therefore, even under Regulation 9 5 , the demand of surcharge on late payment of annual fee was without any lawful authority. 13. In view of what has been held above, we see no reason to interfere in the well-reasoned judgment of the High Court. The instant appeal is therefore, dismissed accordingly.

The fabric of facts, on which the grievance of the appellants\nrests, may be appreciated first. On 21st of July, 1993 the District\nCollector, Sheikhupura issued a notification (Ex.A.2) under section\n\n4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (“the Act”) to the effect that\n\nCA.No.914-L of 2013.doc -2-\n\nan extent of 205 kanals 18 marlas of land in village Baddo and\nKhaki within the limits of Tehsil Ferozewala, District Sheikhupura\nwas intended to be acquired for the public purpose, namely,\nconstruction of Link Road Second New Ravi Bridge, Sagian,\nLahore. No action was taken on this notification for more than a\nyear and thus it became ineffective, and consequently, the District\nCollector had to issue a fresh notification under section 4 of the\nAct in respect of the same land and it was gazetted on 12th of\nOctober, 1994 (Ex.A.3). This area included 19 kanals 14 marlas of\nland, situate in village Baddo, of the appellants. After the\npublication of the above notification, the Land Acquisition Collector\n(“the LAC”) initiated proceedings for the determination of\ncompensation payable to the various owners of the land acquired.\nNotices as required under sections 9 and 10 of the Act were served\nupon the affected persons requiring them to deliver their\nstatements regarding nature of their respective interests in the\nland and particulars of their claims to compensation. In response\nto the notices, the appellants appeared before the LAC and got\nrecorded their statements that their land was of\ncommercial/industrial kind and demanded compensation at the\nrate of Rs.70,000/- per marla. After the usual formalities under\nthe Act had been gone through by the LAC, he on the basis of\nevidence delivered his Award on 234 of April, 1996 (Ex.A.7), in\nwhich 12 kanals 10 marlas of the appellants’ land was declared to\nbe Ghair Mumkin Chapper and 7 kanals 4 marlas was Nul Chahi\n(agricultural property), and the amount of compensation was fixed\nat Rs.1200/- per marla.\n\n3. The appellants were dissatisfied with the Award (Ex.A.7) and\n\nin order to seek a judicious determination of their rights they made\n\nCA.No.914-L of 2013.doc -3-\n\nan application before the LAC under section 18 of the Act asking\nhim to refer their case to the Court for adjudication. On receipt of\nthis application, the LAC made the required reference to the Court\nof Senior Civil Judge, Sheikhupura. Be it noted that the\nappellants in their application had clearly stated that their land\nhad been wrongly declared Ghair Mumkin Chapper and Nul Chahi\nwhereas it was a commercial/industrial area as indicated by its\nlocation. They said it was bounded by Lahore — Sheikhupura Road\nto the north, a housing scheme to the west, a 30-feet wide metalled\nroad to the south, behind which was the National Town Housing\nScheme and Sheikh Ampex Factory to the east. The appellants\nthus claimed compensation at the rate of Rs.70,000/- per marla.\n\n4. On a reference being made at the instance of the appellants,\nthe Reference Court invited the respondents’ reply, on their\ncontest, two issues were framed, and the main issue was whether\nthe compensation for the acquired land owned by the appellants\nwas not in accordance with the market value and whether the\nappellants were entitled to enhancement of compensation as\nprayed for. For this issue, the appellants produced Mushtaq\nAhmad, Patwari of village Baddo (PW-1), Muhammad Masoom,\nformer Reader to the LAC (PW-2), Muhammad Wagqas, Supervisor\nHighway Department (PW-3), Muhammad Zaheer Minhas, Civil\nEngineer/Evaluator (PW-4), while one of the appellants, namely,\nMalik Tariq Mehmood appeared as his own witness before the\nCourt as PW-5. Their documentary evidence consisted of 11\ndocuments, and they were, copy of Mutation No.2740 (Ex.A.1),\ncopy of notification dated 21st of July, 1993 (Ex.A.2), copy of\nnotification dated 12th of October, 1994 (Ex.A.3), copy of\n\nnotification dated 6t of September, 1995 (Ex.A.4), copy of notice\n\nCA.No.914-L of 2013.doc -4-\n\n(Ex.A.5), copy of objections (Ex.A.6), copy of Award (Ex.A.7), copy\nof letter of Board of Revenue (Ex.A.8), copy of qabz-ul-wasool\n(Ex.A.9) and copy of evaluation certificates (Ex.A.10 and Ex.A.11).\nWhereas the respondents produced their Assistant Land Control\nOfficer of the Highway Department, that is, Muhammad Khalid as\nRW-1, and through their counsel tendered copy of notification\ndated 6t» of October, 1994 (Ex.R.1), copy of receipts regarding\npayments (Ex.R.2), copy of statements (Ex.R.3), copy of notices\nissued to the appellants (Ex.R.4) and copy of Award (Ex.R.5). It is\nimportant to note here that since the Reference Court deemed a\nlocal investigation to be proper for the purpose of ascertaining the\nlocation, nature and market value of the appellants’ land, it issued\na commission to Abdul Majeed Kausar, Advocate directing him to\nmake such investigation and to report thereon. Accordingly, the\nLocal Commissioner conducted the investigation and submitted his\nreport (Ex.C-1) and the evidence taken by him (Ex.C-2), appearing\nbefore the Court as CW-1. After considering all these evidences,\nthe Reference Court came to the conclusion that the appellants’\ndemand was not justified and the assessment of their land in the\nAward (Ex.A.7) was correct and on that basis dismissed the\nreference by its judgment dated 6 of January, 2009.\n\n5. The appellants then carried their first appeal to the Lahore\nHigh Court where its Division Bench observed, and rightly did so,\nthat the fate of their appeal depended on the answer to the\nquestion whether their land was commercial, residential or\nagricultural. The learned Judges of the Division Bench then made\na comparative study of the reasons recorded in the judgment of the\nReference Court and the evidence available on record and their\n\nanalysis was that the Reference Court erred in agreeing with the\n\nCA.No.914-L of 2013.doc -5-\n\nassessment made by the LAC in his Award (Ex.A.7), and that it\nwould be unreasonable to assess the land as an agricultural land\nat Rs.1200/- per marla; however, concluded that though the land\nwas surrounded by commercial area, factory area, residential\ncolonies, the appellants could not prove that their land itself was\ncommercial, and thus held that the value of the land should have\nbeen Rs.20,000/- per marla, which was assessed by the LAC for\nthe land adjoining the appellants. Accordingly, through judgment\ndated 8th of October, 2013, the decree was issued in favour of the\nappellants in the following terms:\n\na. The appellants shall be paid compensation for the\nacquired land at the rate of Rs.20,000/- per Marla\nplus 15% compulsory acquisition charges on the said\namount of compensation.\n\nb. The appellants shall also be given compound interest\nat the rate of 8% per annum from the date of\npossession to the date of deposit/payment under\nsection 28 of the Act, at the enhanced rate of land.\n\nc. The appellants shall also be given compound interest\nat the rate of 8% per annum under section 34 of the\nAct on the compensation of land determined by the\nCollector in his award dated 234 of April, 1996 from\nthe date of taking possession of land to the date of\ndeposit/payment of said amount.\n\n6. The appellants are still unhappy and want further increase\nin compensation. Impeaching the judgment and decree passed by\nthe High Court, it has been contended by them that the evidence\non record conclusively suggests that the land was surrounded by a\n\ncommercial area, and thus it was unnecessary to prove that land\n\nCA.No.914-L of 2013.doc -6-\n\nitself was being used for commercial activities, and having regard\nto the extent and boundaries of the land, its market value should\nhave been determined, and for that purpose only the report of the\nlocal commission (Ex.C.1 and Ex.C.2) was sufficient, but no Court\nhas given proper consideration to it. On the other hand, the Addl.\nAdvocate General, taking the stand against the above-stated\narguments, submitted that the land of the appellants was a pond,\nand they have already been adequately compensated, the appeal is\nliable to be dismissed as it appears to have been filed for unjust\nenrichment of the appellants.\n\n7. The quintessence of the above arguments reminds us that\nthe main issue to be resolved in this case had two components.\nThe first was about the nature and classification of the land, while\nthe second related to its value. Before we enter upon considering\nthe evidence adduced on the said issue, we deem it appropriate to\nstate some of the principles on which compensation is required to\nbe determined. Under section 23(1) of the Act, compensation is to\nbe determined on the basis of the market value of the land at the\ndate of publication of the notification under section 4 of the Act.\nThe Court assessing compensation is required to take into\nconsideration not only the present purpose or the present use to\nwhich the land is applied but also any other more beneficial\npurpose to which it might reasonably be put by the owner.!\nIndubitably, it is true that regard can be had only to the existing\nconditions and what is likely to happen in reasonably near future\n\nand compensation cannot be fixed on the basis of what might\n\n1 Vyricherla Narayana Gajapatiraju v.

Land Acquisition Collector and others [PLD 1988 SC\n32]\n\nCA.No.914-L of 2013.doc -7-\n\nhappen in the dim and distant future. Where there is a reasonable\npossibility of the land being put to a more profitable use within a\nreasonable period the same cannot be ignored in assessing its\nvalue.2, Compensation has always to be determined by reference to\nthe price which a willing vendor may reasonably expect to obtain\nfrom a willing purchaser.2 When the land possesses some\nunusual, special or unique features as to its location or\npotentialities, due weight must be attached to all these elements.*\nAfter considering all the circumstances, the Court has to arrive at\na fair estimate with reference to the surrounding circumstances\nand evidence in the case and to award a fair compensation on that\nbasis. The Court further ought to be liberal in the sense that it\nshould not be too meticulous or pedantic in dealing with the\nevidence. It is also true that an entry in the revenue record as to\nthe nature of the land may not be conclusive. If the land acquired\nis found to be useful both for agricultural or non-agricultural\npurposes, merely on the ground that it was used as agricultural\nland by the owner till the time of its acquisition, its potentiality as\n\nnon-agricultural land cannot be ignored.®\n\n2 Bailey v.

We may now examine the evidence adduced in this case in\nthe light of the principles, enumerated above, and make a bid to\nfind out the use, nature and kind of the appellants’ land. As the\nburden of proof was placed on the appellants, they first produced\nthe Patwari of the village Baddo as PW-1, who in his examination-\nin-chief clearly stated that to the east of the land of appellant was\nGhulam Rasool’s commercial land, to the west was bypass road\n(which was Sagian Bridge Road), to the north was the Sheikhupura\n— Lahore Road, and to the south was the commercial area. This\nstatement was not cross-examined, and thus, it will be deemed to\nhave been admitted by the respondents. Another important\nwitness produced by the appellants to determine the kind of land\nwas a Civil Engineer who was also a professional property\nevaluator, named Muhammad Zaheer Minhas who appeared as\nPW-4. He stated in his examination-in-chief that the area was\ncommercial and industrial and during cross-examination he told\nthe same boundaries of the appellants’ land as told by the Patwari\n(PW-1). It appears that at the trial, the Reference Court thought fit\nto ascertain the nature and use of the land through local\ninvestigation and in furtherance of this object issued a commission\nto Abdul Majeed Kausar, Advocate (CW-1) directing him to make\nan investigation and to report thereon. This approach was very\npertinent, and we would like to emphasize here that in such like\ncases the Court should bear in mind that under Article 24 of our\nConstitution, the landowner has a fundamental right to get fair\n\nand just compensation for the land acquired, and must, therefore,\n\nProvince of Punjab through Land Acquisition Collector and another v.

Khuda Bakhsh and others [PLD 2015 SC 187]\n\nCA.No.914-L of 2013.doc -9-\n\ntake all possible steps to protect the landowner from denial of that\nright, and to do so the law does not restrict it to merely rely on the\nevidence of the parties, but obliges it to exercise its suo motu\npowers under Order XXVI, Rule 9 CPC and, to obtain the\nCommission’s report on the matters relating to the location, type\nand use of the land acquired and its market value. We see that in\nthe present case to fulfil the above dictates of a fair trial, and for\nthe compliance of the order of the Court, the Commission visited\nthe site, prepared a site plan, recorded the statement of the parties\nand witnesses, and prepared his report stating that the land of the\nappellants was of very valuable and commercial nature and\nsituated in the factory area. The Local Commissioner returned his\nreport (Ex.C-1) and the evidence (Ex.C-2) taken by him to the\nCourt appearing as CW-1. Needless to state here that per Order\nXXVI Rule 10 CPC the report of the Commissioner together with\nthe evidence recorded by him was evidence in the suit and formed\npart of the record. There is also no denying that Commissioner’s\nintegrity and carefulness was unquestioned, his careful and\nlaborious execution of task was proved by his report, and he had\nnot blindly adopted the assertion of either party, and thus, it was\nnot safe for the Court to disregard it or interfere with the result of a\ncareful local investigation as to the use and location of the land\nacquired.” That being so and considering that the said evidence\nhaving gone unrebutted from the respondent’s side, the same is\nsufficient on the strength of which we can justifiably return our\nfindings that the observation of the Division Bench of the High\n\nCourt that the appellants could not prove that their land was itself\n\n7 Chadan Mull Indra Kumar and others v. Chiman Lal Girdhar Das Parekh and\nanother [AIR 1940 PC 3]\n\nCA.No.914-L of 2013.doc -10-\n\ncommercial, was not correct, for, it escaped its consideration that\nthe land could not be assessed by reference to its use at the time\nof acquisition but by reference to the possible use in future. This\nmeans that the landowner cannot be punished for not using the\nland in a certain way. We would, therefore, hold that\nnotwithstanding the absence of evidence regarding the use of land\nat the time of acquisition, it had become commercial by virtue of\nbeing situated in a commercial area.\n\n9. We may now consider what should be the _ proper\ncompensation for the appellants’ land. We find that notices\n(Ex.A.5) under section 9 of the Act were issued to the appellants,\nand pursuant thereto, they appeared before the LAC and stated\nthat their land was of commercial/industrial kind and demanded\ncompensation at the rate of Rs.70,000/- per marla, but on the\ncontrary, the LAC considered their land as agricultural and fixed\nthe compensation at Rs.1200/- per marla. It would be apposite to\nstate here that in the circumstances we cannot rely on the report\n(Ex.C-1) of the Commission which states that the value of the\nappellants’ land at the time of acquisition was Rs.125,000/- per\nmarla because section 25(1) of the Act provides that the amount\nawarded to the landowner by the Court shall not exceed the\namount so claimed, meaning thereby, the amount to be awarded to\nthe appellant cannot exceed Rs.70,000/- per marla.8 Since, in the\npresent case, we have come to the conclusion that the appellants’\nland was of a commercial nature, the compensation has to be\n\ndetermined accordingly, and about this, our attention has been\n\n8 Hyderabad Development Authority and another v.

There is nothing on record nor was it submitted during the\narguments that anyone was paid more than Rs.40,000/- per marla\nfor the commercial land of Baddo village, so balancing the interest\nof the appellants with the public interest, we are satisfied that the\nsame rate should be for the land of the appellants, and we\naccordingly fix it as doing so would also give equal treatment to the\nlandowners of commercial land acquired.\n\n10. Accordingly, we allow this appeal in part and enhance the\ncompensation awarded from Rs.1200/- per marla to Rs.40,000/-\nper marla. The appellants will be entitled to all statutory benefits\nas already awarded by the Lahore High Court. The judgment and\ndecree dated 8th of October, 2013 issued by the Division Bench of\nthe Lahore High Court are hereby modified in the above terms.\nThere shall be no order as to costs.\n\n11. Above are the reasons of our short order of even date.\n\nJUDGE\n\nJUDGE\n\nISLAMABAD\n29.11.2022\nAPPROVED FOR REPORTING\n\nJUDGE", "CleanedText": "JUDGMENT SHAHID WAHEED, J. The landowners, challenging the decree drawn up in pursuance of the judgment dated 8t of October, 2013 made by the Lahore High Court in its appellate jurisdiction under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 and, in quest of getting adequate compensation for their land acquired, have presented this direct appeal to us on the short ground that even though the judgment and decree dated 6th of January, 2009 of the Reference Court was thereby annulled, the compensation awarded to them was still meagre and disproportionate to its market value. 2. The fabric of facts, on which the grievance of the appellants rests, may be appreciated first. On 21st of July, 1993 the District Collector, Sheikhupura issued a notification Ex.A.2 under section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 the Act to the effect that CA.No.914-L of 2013.doc -2an extent of 205 kanals 18 marlas of land in village Baddo and Khaki within the limits of Tehsil Ferozewala, District Sheikhupura was intended to be acquired for the public purpose, namely, construction of Link Road Second New Ravi Bridge, Sagian, Lahore. No action was taken on this notification for more than a year and thus it became ineffective, and consequently, the District Collector had to issue a fresh notification under section 4 of the Act in respect of the same land and it was gazetted on 12th of October, 1994 Ex.A.3 . This area included 19 kanals 14 marlas of land, situate in village Baddo, of the appellants. After the publication of the above notification, the Land Acquisition Collector the LAC initiated proceedings for the determination of compensation payable to the various owners of the land acquired. Notices as required under sections 9 and 10 of the Act were served upon the affected persons requiring them to deliver their statements regarding nature of their respective interests in the land and particulars of their claims to compensation. In response to the notices, the appellants appeared before the LAC and got recorded their statements that their land was of commercial/industrial kind and demanded compensation at the rate of Rs.70,000/- per marla. After the usual formalities under the Act had been gone through by the LAC, he on the basis of evidence delivered his Award on 234 of April, 1996 Ex.A.7 , in which 12 kanals 10 marlas of the appellants land was declared to be Ghair Mumkin Chapper and 7 kanals 4 marlas was Nul Chahi agricultural property , and the amount of compensation was fixed at Rs.1200/- per marla. 3. The appellants were dissatisfied with the Award Ex.A.7 and in order to seek a judicious determination of their rights they made CA.No.914-L of 2013.doc -3an application before the LAC under section 18 of the Act asking him to refer their case to the Court for adjudication. On receipt of this application, the LAC made the required reference to the Court of Senior Civil Judge, Sheikhupura. Be it noted that the appellants in their application had clearly stated that their land had been wrongly declared Ghair Mumkin Chapper and Nul Chahi whereas it was a commercial/industrial area as indicated by its location. They said it was bounded by Lahore Sheikhupura Road to the north, a housing scheme to the west, a 30-feet wide metalled road to the south, behind which was the National Town Housing Scheme and Sheikh Ampex Factory to the east. The appellants thus claimed compensation at the rate of Rs.70,000/- per marla. 4. On a reference being made at the instance of the appellants, the Reference Court invited the respondents reply, on their contest, two issues were framed, and the main issue was whether the compensation for the acquired land owned by the appellants was not in accordance with the market value and whether the appellants were entitled to enhancement of compensation as prayed for. For this issue, the appellants produced Mushtaq Ahmad, Patwari of village Baddo PW-1 , Muhammad Masoom, former Reader to the LAC PW-2 , Muhammad Wagqas, Supervisor Highway Department PW-3 , Muhammad Zaheer Minhas, Civil Engineer/Evaluator PW-4 , while one of the appellants, namely, Malik Tariq Mehmood appeared as his own witness before the Court as PW-5. Their documentary evidence consisted of 11 documents, and they were, copy of Mutation No.2740 Ex.A.1 , copy of notification dated 21st of July, 1993 Ex.A.2 , copy of notification dated 12th of October, 1994 Ex.A.3 , copy of notification dated 6t of September, 1995 Ex.A.4 , copy of notice CA.No.914-L of 2013.doc -4Ex.A.5 , copy of objections Ex.A.6 , copy of Award Ex.A.7 , copy of letter of Board of Revenue Ex.A.8 , copy of qabz-ul-wasool Ex.A.9 and copy of evaluation certificates Ex.A.10 and Ex.A.11 . Whereas the respondents produced their Assistant Land Control Officer of the Highway Department, that is, Muhammad Khalid as RW-1, and through their counsel tendered copy of notification dated 6t of October, 1994 Ex.R.1 , copy of receipts regarding payments Ex.R.2 , copy of statements Ex.R.3 , copy of notices issued to the appellants Ex.R.4 and copy of Award Ex.R.5 . It is important to note here that since the Reference Court deemed a local investigation to be proper for the purpose of ascertaining the location, nature and market value of the appellants land, it issued a commission to Abdul Majeed Kausar, Advocate directing him to make such investigation and to report thereon. Accordingly, the Local Commissioner conducted the investigation and submitted his report Ex.C-1 and the evidence taken by him Ex.C-2 , appearing before the Court as CW-1. After considering all these evidences, the Reference Court came to the conclusion that the appellants demand was not justified and the assessment of their land in the Award Ex.A.7 was correct and on that basis dismissed the reference by its judgment dated 6 of January, 2009. 5. The appellants then carried their first appeal to the Lahore High Court where its Division Bench observed, and rightly did so, that the fate of their appeal depended on the answer to the question whether their land was commercial, residential or agricultural. The learned Judges of the Division Bench then made a comparative study of the reasons recorded in the judgment of the Reference Court and the evidence available on record and their analysis was that the Reference Court erred in agreeing with the CA.No.914-L of 2013.doc -5assessment made by the LAC in his Award Ex.A.7 , and that it would be unreasonable to assess the land as an agricultural land at Rs.1200/- per marla; however, concluded that though the land was surrounded by commercial area, factory area, residential colonies, the appellants could not prove that their land itself was commercial, and thus held that the value of the land should have been Rs.20,000/- per marla, which was assessed by the LAC for the land adjoining the appellants. Accordingly, through judgment dated 8th of October, 2013, the decree was issued in favour of the appellants in the following terms: a. The appellants shall be paid compensation for the acquired land at the rate of Rs.20,000/- per Marla plus 15 compulsory acquisition charges on the said amount of compensation. b. The appellants shall also be given compound interest at the rate of 8 per annum from the date of possession to the date of deposit/payment under section 28 of the Act, at the enhanced rate of land. c. The appellants shall also be given compound interest at the rate of 8 per annum under section 34 of the Act on the compensation of land determined by the Collector in his award dated 234 of April, 1996 from the date of taking possession of land to the date of deposit/payment of said amount. 6. The appellants are still unhappy and want further increase in compensation. Impeaching the judgment and decree passed by the High Court, it has been contended by them that the evidence on record conclusively suggests that the land was surrounded by a commercial area, and thus it was unnecessary to prove that land CA.No.914-L of 2013.doc -6itself was being used for commercial activities, and having regard to the extent and boundaries of the land, its market value should have been determined, and for that purpose only the report of the local commission Ex.C.1 and Ex.C.2 was sufficient, but no Court has given proper consideration to it. On the other hand, the Addl. Advocate General, taking the stand against the above-stated arguments, submitted that the land of the appellants was a pond, and they have already been adequately compensated, the appeal is liable to be dismissed as it appears to have been filed for unjust enrichment of the appellants. 7. The quintessence of the above arguments reminds us that the main issue to be resolved in this case had two components. The first was about the nature and classification of the land, while the second related to its value. Before we enter upon considering the evidence adduced on the said issue, we deem it appropriate to state some of the principles on which compensation is required to be determined. Under section 23 1 of the Act, compensation is to be determined on the basis of the market value of the land at the date of publication of the notification under section 4 of the Act. The Court assessing compensation is required to take into consideration not only the present purpose or the present use to which the land is applied but also any other more beneficial purpose to which it might reasonably be put by the owner.! Indubitably, it is true that regard can be had only to the existing conditions and what is likely to happen in reasonably near future and compensation cannot be fixed on the basis of what might 1 Vyricherla Narayana Gajapatiraju v. Revenue Divisional Officer, Vizagapatam AIR 1939 PC 98 Malik Aman and others v. Land Acquisition Collector and others PLD 1988 SC 32 CA.No.914-L of 2013.doc -7happen in the dim and distant future. Where there is a reasonable possibility of the land being put to a more profitable use within a reasonable period the same cannot be ignored in assessing its value.2, Compensation has always to be determined by reference to the price which a willing vendor may reasonably expect to obtain from a willing purchaser.2 When the land possesses some unusual, special or unique features as to its location or potentialities, due weight must be attached to all these elements. After considering all the circumstances, the Court has to arrive at a fair estimate with reference to the surrounding circumstances and evidence in the case and to award a fair compensation on that basis. The Court further ought to be liberal in the sense that it should not be too meticulous or pedantic in dealing with the evidence. It is also true that an entry in the revenue record as to the nature of the land may not be conclusive. If the land acquired is found to be useful both for agricultural or non-agricultural purposes, merely on the ground that it was used as agricultural land by the owner till the time of its acquisition, its potentiality as non-agricultural land cannot be ignored. 2 Bailey v.

As the burden of proof was placed on the appellants, they first produced the Patwari of the village Baddo as PW-1, who in his examinationin-chief clearly stated that to the east of the land of appellant was Ghulam Rasool s commercial land, to the west was bypass road which was Sagian Bridge Road , to the north was the Sheikhupura Lahore Road, and to the south was the commercial area. This statement was not cross-examined, and thus, it will be deemed to have been admitted by the respondents. Another important witness produced by the appellants to determine the kind of land was a Civil Engineer who was also a professional property evaluator, named Muhammad Zaheer Minhas who appeared as PW-4. He stated in his examination-in-chief that the area was commercial and industrial and during cross-examination he told the same boundaries of the appellants land as told by the Patwari PW-1 . It appears that at the trial, the Reference Court thought fit to ascertain the nature and use of the land through local investigation and in furtherance of this object issued a commission to Abdul Majeed Kausar, Advocate CW-1 directing him to make an investigation and to report thereon. This approach was very pertinent, and we would like to emphasize here that in such like cases the Court should bear in mind that under Article 24 of our Constitution, the landowner has a fundamental right to get fair and just compensation for the land acquired, and must, therefore, Province of Punjab through Land Acquisition Collector and another v. Begum Aziza 2014 SCMR 75 6 Hafiz Tassaduq Hussain v. Lal Khatoon and others PLD 2011 SC 296 Farzand Ali and another v. Khuda Bakhsh and others PLD 2015 SC 187 CA.No.914-L of 2013.doc -9take all possible steps to protect the landowner from denial of that right, and to do so the law does not restrict it to merely rely on the evidence of the parties, but obliges it to exercise its suo motu powers under Order XXVI, Rule 9 CPC and, to obtain the Commission s report on the matters relating to the location, type and use of the land acquired and its market value. We see that in the present case to fulfil the above dictates of a fair trial, and for the compliance of the order of the Court, the Commission visited the site, prepared a site plan, recorded the statement of the parties and witnesses, and prepared his report stating that the land of the appellants was of very valuable and commercial nature and situated in the factory area. The Local Commissioner returned his report Ex.C-1 and the evidence Ex.C-2 taken by him to the Court appearing as CW-1. Needless to state here that per Order XXVI Rule 10 CPC the report of the Commissioner together with the evidence recorded by him was evidence in the suit and formed part of the record. There is also no denying that Commissioner s integrity and carefulness was unquestioned, his careful and laborious execution of task was proved by his report, and he had not blindly adopted the assertion of either party, and thus, it was not safe for the Court to disregard it or interfere with the result of a careful local investigation as to the use and location of the land acquired. That being so and considering that the said evidence having gone unrebutted from the respondent s side, the same is sufficient on the strength of which we can justifiably return our findings that the observation of the Division Bench of the High Court that the appellants could not prove that their land was itself 7 Chadan Mull Indra Kumar and others v. Chiman Lal Girdhar Das Parekh and another AIR 1940 PC 3 CA.No.914-L of 2013.doc -10commercial, was not correct, for, it escaped its consideration that the land could not be assessed by reference to its use at the time of acquisition but by reference to the possible use in future. This means that the landowner cannot be punished for not using the land in a certain way. We would, therefore, hold that notwithstanding the absence of evidence regarding the use of land at the time of acquisition, it had become commercial by virtue of being situated in a commercial area. 9. We may now consider what should be the proper compensation for the appellants land. We find that notices Ex.A.5 under section 9 of the Act were issued to the appellants, and pursuant thereto, they appeared before the LAC and stated that their land was of commercial/industrial kind and demanded compensation at the rate of Rs.70,000/- per marla, but on the contrary, the LAC considered their land as agricultural and fixed the compensation at Rs.1200/- per marla. It would be apposite to state here that in the circumstances we cannot rely on the report Ex.C-1 of the Commission which states that the value of the appellants land at the time of acquisition was Rs.125,000/- per marla because section 25 1 of the Act provides that the amount awarded to the landowner by the Court shall not exceed the amount so claimed, meaning thereby, the amount to be awarded to the appellant cannot exceed Rs.70,000/- per marla.8 Since, in the present case, we have come to the conclusion that the appellants land was of a commercial nature, the compensation has to be determined accordingly, and about this, our attention has been 8 Hyderabad Development Authority and another v. Karam Khan Shoro 1985 SCMR 45 Land Acquisition Officer and Assistant Commissioner, Hyderabad v. Gul Muhammad through legal heirs PLD 2005 SC 311 CA.No.914-L of 2013.doc -lldrawn to the letter No.1039-95/40-S-IV dated 8th of January, 1996 of the Board of Revenue, Punjab Ex.A.8 , in which the rate of commercial land of village Baddo has been fixed at Rs.40,000/- per marla. There is nothing on record nor was it submitted during the arguments that anyone was paid more than Rs.40,000/- per marla for the commercial land of Baddo village, so balancing the interest of the appellants with the public interest, we are satisfied that the same rate should be for the land of the appellants, and we accordingly fix it as doing so would also give equal treatment to the landowners of commercial land acquired. 10. Accordingly, we allow this appeal in part and enhance the compensation awarded from Rs.1200/- per marla to Rs.40,000/- per marla. The appellants will be entitled to all statutory benefits as already awarded by the Lahore High Court. The judgment and decree dated 8th of October, 2013 issued by the Division Bench of the Lahore High Court are hereby modified in the above terms. There shall be no order as to costs. 11. Above are the reasons of our short order of even date. JUDGE JUDGE ISLAMABAD 29.11.2022 APPROVED FOR REPORTING JUDGE", "Sentences": ["The landowners, challenging the decree drawn up in pursuance of the judgment dated 8t of October, 2013 made by the Lahore High Court in its appellate jurisdiction under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 and, in quest of getting adequate compensation for their land acquired, have presented this direct appeal to us on the short ground that even though the judgment and decree dated 6th of January, 2009 of the Reference Court was thereby annulled, the compensation awarded to them was still meagre and disproportionate to its market value.", "The fabric of facts, on which the grievance of the appellants rests, may be appreciated first.", "On 21st of July, 1993 the District Collector, Sheikhupura issued a notification Ex.A.2 under section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 the Act to the effect that CA.No.914-L of 2013.doc -2an extent of 205 kanals 18 marlas of land in village Baddo and Khaki within the limits of Tehsil Ferozewala, District Sheikhupura was intended to be acquired for the public purpose, namely, construction of Link Road Second New Ravi Bridge, Sagian, Lahore.", "No action was taken on this notification for more than a year and thus it became ineffective, and consequently, the District Collector had to issue a fresh notification under section 4 of the Act in respect of the same land and it was gazetted on 12th of October, 1994 Ex.A.3 .", "This area included 19 kanals 14 marlas of land, situate in village Baddo, of the appellants.", "After the publication of the above notification, the Land Acquisition Collector the LAC initiated proceedings for the determination of compensation payable to the various owners of the land acquired.", "Notices as required under sections 9 and 10 of the Act were served upon the affected persons requiring them to deliver their statements regarding nature of their respective interests in the land and particulars of their claims to compensation.", "In response to the notices, the appellants appeared before the LAC and got recorded their statements that their land was of commercial/industrial kind and demanded compensation at the rate of Rs.70,000/- per marla.", "After the usual formalities under the Act had been gone through by the LAC, he on the basis of evidence delivered his Award on 234 of April, 1996 Ex.A.7 , in which 12 kanals 10 marlas of the appellants land was declared to be Ghair Mumkin Chapper and 7 kanals 4 marlas was Nul Chahi agricultural property , and the amount of compensation was fixed at Rs.1200/- per marla.", "The appellants were dissatisfied with the Award Ex.A.7 and in order to seek a judicious determination of their rights they made CA.No.914-L of 2013.doc -3an application before the LAC under section 18 of the Act asking him to refer their case to the Court for adjudication.", "On receipt of this application, the LAC made the required reference to the Court of Senior Civil Judge, Sheikhupura.", "Be it noted that the appellants in their application had clearly stated that their land had been wrongly declared Ghair Mumkin Chapper and Nul Chahi whereas it was a commercial/industrial area as indicated by its location.", "They said it was bounded by Lahore Sheikhupura Road to the north, a housing scheme to the west, a 30-feet wide metalled road to the south, behind which was the National Town Housing Scheme and Sheikh Ampex Factory to the east.", "The appellants thus claimed compensation at the rate of Rs.70,000/- per marla.", "On a reference being made at the instance of the appellants, the Reference Court invited the respondents reply, on their contest, two issues were framed, and the main issue was whether the compensation for the acquired land owned by the appellants was not in accordance with the market value and whether the appellants were entitled to enhancement of compensation as prayed for.", "For this issue, the appellants produced Mushtaq Ahmad, Patwari of village Baddo PW-1 , Muhammad Masoom, former Reader to the LAC PW-2 , Muhammad Wagqas, Supervisor Highway Department PW-3 , Muhammad Zaheer Minhas, Civil Engineer/Evaluator PW-4 , while one of the appellants, namely, Malik Tariq Mehmood appeared as his own witness before the Court as PW-5.", "Their documentary evidence consisted of 11 documents, and they were, copy of Mutation No.2740 Ex.A.1 , copy of notification dated 21st of July, 1993 Ex.A.2 , copy of notification dated 12th of October, 1994 Ex.A.3 , copy of notification dated 6t of September, 1995 Ex.A.4 , copy of notice CA.No.914-L of 2013.doc -4Ex.A.5 , copy of objections Ex.A.6 , copy of Award Ex.A.7 , copy of letter of Board of Revenue Ex.A.8 , copy of qabz-ul-wasool Ex.A.9 and copy of evaluation certificates Ex.A.10 and Ex.A.11 .", "Whereas the respondents produced their Assistant Land Control Officer of the Highway Department, that is, Muhammad Khalid as RW-1, and through their counsel tendered copy of notification dated 6t of October, 1994 Ex.R.1 , copy of receipts regarding payments Ex.R.2 , copy of statements Ex.R.3 , copy of notices issued to the appellants Ex.R.4 and copy of Award Ex.R.5 .", "It is important to note here that since the Reference Court deemed a local investigation to be proper for the purpose of ascertaining the location, nature and market value of the appellants land, it issued a commission to Abdul Majeed Kausar, Advocate directing him to make such investigation and to report thereon.", "Accordingly, the Local Commissioner conducted the investigation and submitted his report Ex.C-1 and the evidence taken by him Ex.C-2 , appearing before the Court as CW-1.", "After considering all these evidences, the Reference Court came to the conclusion that the appellants demand was not justified and the assessment of their land in the Award Ex.A.7 was correct and on that basis dismissed the reference by its judgment dated 6 of January, 2009.", "The appellants then carried their first appeal to the Lahore High Court where its Division Bench observed, and rightly did so, that the fate of their appeal depended on the answer to the question whether their land was commercial, residential or agricultural.", "The learned Judges of the Division Bench then made a comparative study of the reasons recorded in the judgment of the Reference Court and the evidence available on record and their analysis was that the Reference Court erred in agreeing with the CA.No.914-L of 2013.doc -5assessment made by the LAC in his Award Ex.A.7 , and that it would be unreasonable to assess the land as an agricultural land at Rs.1200/- per marla; however, concluded that though the land was surrounded by commercial area, factory area, residential colonies, the appellants could not prove that their land itself was commercial, and thus held that the value of the land should have been Rs.20,000/- per marla, which was assessed by the LAC for the land adjoining the appellants.", "Accordingly, through judgment dated 8th of October, 2013, the decree was issued in favour of the appellants in the following terms: a.", "The appellants shall be paid compensation for the acquired land at the rate of Rs.20,000/- per Marla plus 15 compulsory acquisition charges on the said amount of compensation.", "The appellants shall also be given compound interest at the rate of 8 per annum from the date of possession to the date of deposit/payment under section 28 of the Act, at the enhanced rate of land.", "c. The appellants shall also be given compound interest at the rate of 8 per annum under section 34 of the Act on the compensation of land determined by the Collector in his award dated 234 of April, 1996 from the date of taking possession of land to the date of deposit/payment of said amount.", "The appellants are still unhappy and want further increase in compensation.", "Impeaching the judgment and decree passed by the High Court, it has been contended by them that the evidence on record conclusively suggests that the land was surrounded by a commercial area, and thus it was unnecessary to prove that land CA.No.914-L of 2013.doc -6itself was being used for commercial activities, and having regard to the extent and boundaries of the land, its market value should have been determined, and for that purpose only the report of the local commission Ex.C.1 and Ex.C.2 was sufficient, but no Court has given proper consideration to it.", "On the other hand, the Addl.", "Advocate General, taking the stand against the above-stated arguments, submitted that the land of the appellants was a pond, and they have already been adequately compensated, the appeal is liable to be dismissed as it appears to have been filed for unjust enrichment of the appellants.", "The quintessence of the above arguments reminds us that the main issue to be resolved in this case had two components.", "The first was about the nature and classification of the land, while the second related to its value.", "Before we enter upon considering the evidence adduced on the said issue, we deem it appropriate to state some of the principles on which compensation is required to be determined.", "Under section 23 1 of the Act, compensation is to be determined on the basis of the market value of the land at the date of publication of the notification under section 4 of the Act.", "The Court assessing compensation is required to take into consideration not only the present purpose or the present use to which the land is applied but also any other more beneficial purpose to which it might reasonably be put by the owner.!", "Indubitably, it is true that regard can be had only to the existing conditions and what is likely to happen in reasonably near future and compensation cannot be fixed on the basis of what might 1 Vyricherla Narayana Gajapatiraju v. Revenue Divisional Officer, Vizagapatam AIR 1939 PC 98 Malik Aman and others v. Land Acquisition Collector and others PLD 1988 SC 32 CA.No.914-L of 2013.doc -7happen in the dim and distant future.", "Where there is a reasonable possibility of the land being put to a more profitable use within a reasonable period the same cannot be ignored in assessing its value.2, Compensation has always to be determined by reference to the price which a willing vendor may reasonably expect to obtain from a willing purchaser.2 When the land possesses some unusual, special or unique features as to its location or potentialities, due weight must be attached to all these elements.", "After considering all the circumstances, the Court has to arrive at a fair estimate with reference to the surrounding circumstances and evidence in the case and to award a fair compensation on that basis.", "The Court further ought to be liberal in the sense that it should not be too meticulous or pedantic in dealing with the evidence.", "It is also true that an entry in the revenue record as to the nature of the land may not be conclusive.", "If the land acquired is found to be useful both for agricultural or non-agricultural purposes, merely on the ground that it was used as agricultural land by the owner till the time of its acquisition, its potentiality as non-agricultural land cannot be ignored.", "2 Bailey v.

MALIK, J.- This Appeal impugns\n\njudgment dated 24.07.2013, passed by the Peshawar High Court,\nAbbottabad Bench, in Civil Revision No.119-A of 2006.\n\n2. The basic facts of the case are that the Respondents\nfiled suit No.170/1 of 2002 for declaration, perpetual injunction\nand recovery of possession on 18.07.1995 against the Appellants,\nwith respect to the land located in the Shamlat Deh, measuring\n106 Kanals and 11 Marlas bearing Khasra Nos.3026/7 and 9\nsituated in Village Jagul Tehsil & District Haripur. The case of the\nRespondents was that they are the sole owners in possession of\nthe suit land as Hissadari and that the Appellants have no right of\nownership or possession to the said land. The suit was decreed on\n\n11.02.2004 in favour of the Respondents wherein the Court\n\nCA.1296 of 2013\n\nconcluded that the Respondents were the owners in possession of\nthe disputed property as Hissadars and that the Appellants were\nnot able to prove any right of ownership or possession, yet they\nwere entitled to receive Rs.300,000/- for improvements made on\nthe disputed property. Both parties filed Appeals such that the\nAppellants filed Appeal No.26/13 and the Respondents filed\nAppeal No.147/13. Both Appeals were heard together and the\nAppellate Court set aside the judgment and decree dated\n11.02.2004 and remanded the matter to the trial court to decide\nthe matter afresh, essentially on the ground that one Muhammad\nSiddique sought impleadment as a necessary party to the suit of\nthe Respondents, being a co-owner in the disputed property. The\nAppellate Court concluded that as Muhammad Siddique was a\nnecessary party, he should be heard and the matter had to be\ndecided afresh. Hence, the case was remanded to the trial court\nvide order dated 26.01.2006. Against this order of 26.01.2006, the\nRespondents filed Civil Revision No.119-A of 2006 before the High\nCourt wherein, the remand order was set aside and the original\njudgment and decree dated 11.02.2004 was_ restored.\nFurthermore, the findings of the trial court to the extent of grant of\nRs.300,000/- by the Respondents to the Appellants as a\ncompensation for improvements made was set aside.\n\n3. The Appellants have challenged the judgment of the\nHigh Court essentially on the ground that since a remand order\nwas before the High Court, at best the Court could have either\naffirmed the remand order or set it aside and remand the matter to\n\nthe Appellate Court for a fresh decision on merit. The learned\n\nCA.1296 of 2013\n\ncounsel argued that the High Court in its Revisional Jurisdiction\nunder Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC) has\nto confine itself to the legality of the order of remand and cannot\ndecide the case on its merits. He emphasised on the use of the\nwords in the case in Section 115 of the CPC to suggest that a\nRevision Petition lies against a case decided which would\nnecessitate the disposal of the case and not adjudication of the lis\nbetween the parties. In this regard, he has relied upon Pakistan\n\nFisheries Ltd., Karachi and others v. United Bank Ltd. (PLD 1993\n\nSC 109). The learned counsel has essentially argued that the\npower of the Revisional Court under Section 115 of the CPC in a\ncase where a remand order has been made by the Appellate Court\nis restricted to determine the legality of the remand order and as\nsuch the Court does not have jurisdiction to decide the entire\ncontroversy between the parties.\n\n4. The learned counsel for the Respondents has\nsubmitted written arguments in which he has raised the issue of\nlimitation that this Appeal is barred by one day and that there is\nno explanation for the delay. On merit, the learned counsel argued\nthat it is important to note that Muhammad Siddique, who sought\nimpleadment in the suit before the Appellate Court has not\nchallenged the impugned judgment dated 24.07.2013, which\ntestifies to the fact that his objective was to delay the matter before\nthe trial court. The learned counsel further argued that so far as\nthe question of jurisdiction under Section 115 of the CPC is\nconcerned, the High Court may pass any order as it deem fit,\n\nmeaning that after taking notice of the error committed by the\n\nCA.1296 of 2013\n\nsubordinate court, the High Court could either remand the case or\ncorrect the error. He further submits that the concept of case\ndecided and the use of the word the case under Section 115 of the\nCPC does not in any manner restrict the High Court from deciding\nthe case on its merits, especially so, when no new evidence was\nrequired, as in the instant case where the High Court merely\ncorrected the error of the Appellate Court.\n\n5. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties at\nconsiderable length and note that in the application for\ncondonation of delay the learned ASC, Muhammad Munir Paracha\nhas stated that the delay of one day is not intentional rather based\non a simple calculation mistake as he assumed July to have 30\ndays instead of 31 days and thus, erroneously calculated the last\nday for filing the appeal as 10.09.2013 instead of 09.09.2013. He\nhas explained that the delay of one day is neither deliberate nor\nbased on any mala fide, rather a simple human mistake. Given the\ncontents of the application for condonation of delay accompanied\nby the affidavit, we condone the delay and proceed to decide the\ncase on its merits.\n\n6. The basic issue is whether the High Court under\nSection 115 of the CPC was restricted to have either affirmed the\nremand order or else, if found defective, obligated to remand the\nmatter to the Appellate Court to decide the case on its merits.\nSection 115 of the CPC is reproduced hereunder:-\n\n“115. Revision (1) The High Court may call for\nthe record of any case which has been decided\nby any Court subordinate to such High Court\nand in which no appeal lies thereto, and if such\nsubordinate Court appears-\n\nCA.1296 of 2013\n\n(a) to have exercised a jurisdiction not vested\nin it by law, or\n\n(b) to have failed to exercise a jurisdiction so\nvested, or\n(c) to have acted in the exercise of its\n\njurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity,\n\nthe High Court may make such order in the case\nas it thinks fit; (emphasis added)\n\nProvided that where a person makes an\napplication under this subsection, he shall, in\nsupport of such application, furnish copies of the\npleadings, documents and order of the\nsubordinate Court and the High Court shall,\nexcept for reasons to be recorded, dispose of\nsuch application without calling for the record of\nthe subordinate Court.\n\nProvided further that such application\nshall be made within ninety days of the decision\nof the subordinate Court [which shall provide a\ncopy of such decision within three days thereof\n\nand the High Court shall dispose of such\napplication within six months].”\n\n7. The arguments of the learned counsel for the\nAppellants are based on the use of the words in the case in Section\n115 of the CPC where the High Court may make such order in the\n\ncase as it thinks fit. While relying on Pakistan Fisheries’ case\n\n(supra) the learned counsel has suggested that since a revision lies\nagainst a case decided the High Court could not have adjudicated\nupon the merits of the case but should have remanded the matter\nto the Appellate Court for a fresh decision. We are not in\nagreement with the contentions of the learned counsel in this\ncase, on two accounts; firstly, there was sufficient evidence in the\ncase, hence the Appellate Court was in error, when it remanded\nthe matter; and secondly, the use of the words in the case in\nSection 115 of the CPC, does not restrict the jurisdiction of the\n\ncourt under Section 115 of the CPC. From the record, it is evident\n\nCA.1296 of 2013\n\nthat the Appellate Court remanded the matter to the trial court on\naccount of an application for impleadment filed by Muhammad\nSiddique who claimed that he had constructed a house on the\nproperty in dispute of which he is the owner in possession and\nthat he had not been impleaded as a necessary party in the suit,\nhence the judgment and decree was illegal. The Appellate Court\nwithout considering the record or the evidence, remanded the case\nfor a fresh decision. The High Court vide the impugned judgment\nconsidered the application of Muhammad Siddique and concluded\nthat there was no reason to remand the case, on the impleadment\nof Muhammad Siddique, as he is the brother of Respondents No.6\nand 7 in the instant Petition being Muhammad Ajeeb and Khalid,\nand that Muhammad Siddique’s claim is the same as that of\nMuhammad Ajeeb and Khalid. The learned High Court concluded\nthat Muhammad Siddique holds the same status in respect of the\ndisputed property as that of his brothers and therefore, there was\nno basis to remand the matter for a fresh decision as the issue\nstands decided. Consequently, the Appellate Court committed an\nerror by remanding the matter as it was not a case where fresh\nevidence was required, as the rights of Muhammad Siddique had\nalready been adjudicated upon through his brothers who raised\nthe same claim as that of Muhammad Siddique. In this regard, we\nnote that the trial court concluded that the Appellants were not\nable to establish their rights as owners in possession of the\ndisputed property whereas the Respondents had established their\nclaim of being Hissadars in the Shamilat Deh from 1947 onwards.\n\nFurthermore, we find that a remand order is required in cases\n\nCA.1296 of 2013\n\nwhich cannot be decided on the basis of available evidence,\nhowever, where the evidence is sufficient for a decision of a case, a\nremand order is not required. The learned High Court in this case\nwas justified not to remand the matter to the Appellate Court, and\nset aside the remand order as the record showed that there was no\nreason to adjudicate afresh on the rights of Muhammad Siddique’s\nclaims, as his rights, if any, were the same as his two brothers\nwho were contesting the case.\n\n8. So far as the arguments with respect to the meaning\nin the case in Section 115 of the CPC, we find that it does not\nsuggest a restrictive interpretation to the jurisdiction of the court\nunder Section 115 of the CPC. In the case of Raja Hamayun\n\nSarfraz_ Khan_and_others v. Noor Muhammad (2007 SCMR 307)\n\nthis Court has held that where a remand order of the Appellate\nCourt was in issue, the High Court was justified in not remanding\nthe case to the Appellate Court as the High Court has given solid\nreasons for restoring the judgment of the trial court. In this case,\nthe parties have been litigating for over twenty years, and the only\nground agitated before the High Court and before us today is the\nlegality of the remand order.\n\n9. Under these circumstances, we find no merit in this\n\nAppeal. Consequently, the Appeal is dismissed with no order as to\n\ncosts.\nJUDGE\nBench-IV\nIslamabad JUDGE\n07.02.2022\n\n‘APPROVED FOR REPORTING’\n\nAsif/*\n\n\nCA.1296 of 2013", "CleanedText": "JUDGMENT AYESHA A. MALIK, J.- This Appeal impugns judgment dated 24.07.2013, passed by the Peshawar High Court, Abbottabad Bench, in Civil Revision No.119-A of 2006. 2. The basic facts of the case are that the Respondents filed suit No.170/1 of 2002 for declaration, perpetual injunction and recovery of possession on 18.07.1995 against the Appellants, with respect to the land located in the Shamlat Deh, measuring 106 Kanals and 11 Marlas bearing Khasra Nos.3026/7 and 9 situated in Village Jagul Tehsil District Haripur. The case of the Respondents was that they are the sole owners in possession of the suit land as Hissadari and that the Appellants have no right of ownership or possession to the said land. The suit was decreed on 11.02.2004 in favour of the Respondents wherein the Court CA.1296 of 2013 concluded that the Respondents were the owners in possession of the disputed property as Hissadars and that the Appellants were not able to prove any right of ownership or possession, yet they were entitled to receive Rs.300,000/- for improvements made on the disputed property. Both parties filed Appeals such that the Appellants filed Appeal No.26/13 and the Respondents filed Appeal No.147/13. Both Appeals were heard together and the Appellate Court set aside the judgment and decree dated 11.02.2004 and remanded the matter to the trial court to decide the matter afresh, essentially on the ground that one Muhammad Siddique sought impleadment as a necessary party to the suit of the Respondents, being a co-owner in the disputed property. The Appellate Court concluded that as Muhammad Siddique was a necessary party, he should be heard and the matter had to be decided afresh. Hence, the case was remanded to the trial court vide order dated 26.01.2006. Against this order of 26.01.2006, the Respondents filed Civil Revision No.119-A of 2006 before the High Court wherein, the remand order was set aside and the original judgment and decree dated 11.02.2004 was restored. Furthermore, the findings of the trial court to the extent of grant of Rs.300,000/- by the Respondents to the Appellants as a compensation for improvements made was set aside. 3. The Appellants have challenged the judgment of the High Court essentially on the ground that since a remand order was before the High Court, at best the Court could have either affirmed the remand order or set it aside and remand the matter to the Appellate Court for a fresh decision on merit. The learned CA.1296 of 2013 counsel argued that the High Court in its Revisional Jurisdiction under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 CPC has to confine itself to the legality of the order of remand and cannot decide the case on its merits. He emphasised on the use of the words in the case in Section 115 of the CPC to suggest that a Revision Petition lies against a case decided which would necessitate the disposal of the case and not adjudication of the lis between the parties. In this regard, he has relied upon Pakistan Fisheries Ltd., Karachi and others v. United Bank Ltd. PLD 1993 SC 109 . The learned counsel has essentially argued that the power of the Revisional Court under Section 115 of the CPC in a case where a remand order has been made by the Appellate Court is restricted to determine the legality of the remand order and as such the Court does not have jurisdiction to decide the entire controversy between the parties. 4. The learned counsel for the Respondents has submitted written arguments in which he has raised the issue of limitation that this Appeal is barred by one day and that there is no explanation for the delay. On merit, the learned counsel argued that it is important to note that Muhammad Siddique, who sought impleadment in the suit before the Appellate Court has not challenged the impugned judgment dated 24.07.2013, which testifies to the fact that his objective was to delay the matter before the trial court. The learned counsel further argued that so far as the question of jurisdiction under Section 115 of the CPC is concerned, the High Court may pass any order as it deem fit, meaning that after taking notice of the error committed by the CA.1296 of 2013 subordinate court, the High Court could either remand the case or correct the error. He further submits that the concept of case decided and the use of the word the case under Section 115 of the CPC does not in any manner restrict the High Court from deciding the case on its merits, especially so, when no new evidence was required, as in the instant case where the High Court merely corrected the error of the Appellate Court. 5. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties at considerable length and note that in the application for condonation of delay the learned ASC, Muhammad Munir Paracha has stated that the delay of one day is not intentional rather based on a simple calculation mistake as he assumed July to have 30 days instead of 31 days and thus, erroneously calculated the last day for filing the appeal as 10.09.2013 instead of 09.09.2013. He has explained that the delay of one day is neither deliberate nor based on any mala fide, rather a simple human mistake. Given the contents of the application for condonation of delay accompanied by the affidavit, we condone the delay and proceed to decide the case on its merits. 6. The basic issue is whether the High Court under Section 115 of the CPC was restricted to have either affirmed the remand order or else, if found defective, obligated to remand the matter to the Appellate Court to decide the case on its merits. Section 115 of the CPC is reproduced hereunder:- 115. Revision 1 The High Court may call for the record of any case which has been decided by any Court subordinate to such High Court and in which no appeal lies thereto, and if such subordinate Court appearsCA.1296 of 2013 a to have exercised a jurisdiction not vested in it by law, or b to have failed to exercise a jurisdiction so vested, or c to have acted in the exercise of its jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity, the High Court may make such order in the case as it thinks fit; emphasis added Provided that where a person makes an application under this subsection, he shall, in support of such application, furnish copies of the pleadings, documents and order of the subordinate Court and the High Court shall, except for reasons to be recorded, dispose of such application without calling for the record of the subordinate Court. Provided further that such application shall be made within ninety days of the decision of the subordinate Court which shall provide a copy of such decision within three days thereof and the High Court shall dispose of such application within six months . 7. The arguments of the learned counsel for the Appellants are based on the use of the words in the case in Section 115 of the CPC where the High Court may make such order in the case as it thinks fit. While relying on Pakistan Fisheries case supra the learned counsel has suggested that since a revision lies against a case decided the High Court could not have adjudicated upon the merits of the case but should have remanded the matter to the Appellate Court for a fresh decision. We are not in agreement with the contentions of the learned counsel in this case, on two accounts; firstly, there was sufficient evidence in the case, hence the Appellate Court was in error, when it remanded the matter; and secondly, the use of the words in the case in Section 115 of the CPC, does not restrict the jurisdiction of the court under Section 115 of the CPC. From the record, it is evident CA.1296 of 2013 that the Appellate Court remanded the matter to the trial court on account of an application for impleadment filed by Muhammad Siddique who claimed that he had constructed a house on the property in dispute of which he is the owner in possession and that he had not been impleaded as a necessary party in the suit, hence the judgment and decree was illegal. The Appellate Court without considering the record or the evidence, remanded the case for a fresh decision. The High Court vide the impugned judgment considered the application of Muhammad Siddique and concluded that there was no reason to remand the case, on the impleadment of Muhammad Siddique, as he is the brother of Respondents No.6 and 7 in the instant Petition being Muhammad Ajeeb and Khalid, and that Muhammad Siddique s claim is the same as that of Muhammad Ajeeb and Khalid. The learned High Court concluded that Muhammad Siddique holds the same status in respect of the disputed property as that of his brothers and therefore, there was no basis to remand the matter for a fresh decision as the issue stands decided. Consequently, the Appellate Court committed an error by remanding the matter as it was not a case where fresh evidence was required, as the rights of Muhammad Siddique had already been adjudicated upon through his brothers who raised the same claim as that of Muhammad Siddique. In this regard, we note that the trial court concluded that the Appellants were not able to establish their rights as owners in possession of the disputed property whereas the Respondents had established their claim of being Hissadars in the Shamilat Deh from 1947 onwards. Furthermore, we find that a remand order is required in cases CA.1296 of 2013 which cannot be decided on the basis of available evidence, however, where the evidence is sufficient for a decision of a case, a remand order is not required. The learned High Court in this case was justified not to remand the matter to the Appellate Court, and set aside the remand order as the record showed that there was no reason to adjudicate afresh on the rights of Muhammad Siddique s claims, as his rights, if any, were the same as his two brothers who were contesting the case. 8. So far as the arguments with respect to the meaning in the case in Section 115 of the CPC, we find that it does not suggest a restrictive interpretation to the jurisdiction of the court under Section 115 of the CPC. In the case of Raja Hamayun Sarfraz Khan and others v. Noor Muhammad 2007 SCMR 307 this Court has held that where a remand order of the Appellate Court was in issue, the High Court was justified in not remanding the case to the Appellate Court as the High Court has given solid reasons for restoring the judgment of the trial court. In this case, the parties have been litigating for over twenty years, and the only ground agitated before the High Court and before us today is the legality of the remand order. 9. Under these circumstances, we find no merit in this Appeal. Consequently, the Appeal is dismissed with no order as to costs.

The present case relates to the contested claims of the\nparties over part of the estate of Mawaz Khan, relating to his two\nproperties, the particulars whereof are: 98-Kanals of land in Mauza\nChorlaki, Tehsil & District Kohat (“Suit Property No.1”), which was\npurportedly gifted by him to his daughter-in-law, namely, Mst. Rabia Gul\nand four granddaughters, namely, Mst. Khan Khela, Mst.Khurseed\nBegum, Mst. Badshah Zareena and Mst. Bibi Ghufran (“appellants”), vide\n\nmutation No. 167 dated 29.04.1977 (“gift mutation”); and 36-Kanals of\n\nCivil Appeal No. 139-P of 2013 2\n\nland in Mauza Chorlaki, Tehsil & District Kohat (“Suit Property No. 2”),\nwhich was inherited, by his son, Muhmmad Janan (“respondent”), and\nthen purportedly sold, by him to his daughter, namely, Mst. Khursheed\nBegum (appellant No.3) vide mutation No. 1224 dated 24.02.2004 (“sale\n\nmutation”).\n\n3. As for clarity of relationship of the parties, the admitted\nposition is that: Mawaz Khan, the original owner of the Suit Properties,\npassed away in the year 2000; the respondent being Mawaz Khan’s son,\nwas entitled to inherit his share in the estate of Mawaz Khan; the\nrespondent, had two wives: the first was Mst. Rabia Gula (appellant No.1),\nand from this wedlock, he had four daughters, namely, Mst. Khan Khela,\nMst.Khurseed Begum, Mst.Badshah Zareena and Mst.Bibi Ghufran\n(appellants No.2 to 5); while from his second wife, he had one son,\n\nMuhammad Ibrar, and one daughter, Mst.

The respondent instituted a suit, on 12.01.2009, seeking\ndeclaration of his ownership of the Suit Properties No.1 and 2, based on\nhis claim to have inherited the same from his father, Mawaz Khan, and\nchallenged the gift mutation and the sale mutation, asserting the same to\nbe the result of fraud, and claiming that he came to know about them\n\nsome days before the institution of the suit.\n\n5. The suit was dismissed by the trial court vide judgment\ndated 13.07.2011, which was maintained by the appellate court vide\njudgment dated 04.10.2011. However, the High Court, while exercising\nits revisional jurisdiction, set aside the concurrent judgments of the two\ncourts and decreed the suit of the respondent vide the judgment dated\n\n17.05.2013 (“impugned judgment”). Hence, the present appeal.\n\nCivil Appeal No. 139-P of 2013 3\n\n6. It would be pertinent to note that the respondent, passed\naway during pendency of this appeal, and his son and daughter from his\nsecond wife, namely, Muhammad Ibrar and Mst. Amir Khela, were\nimpleaded, as respondents in the appeal. Today, despite service of notice\nof fixation of this appeal for hearing, no one has appeared before us on\nbehalf of Muhammad Ibrar and Mst. Amir Khela, hence, they are\n\nproceeded ex-parte.\n\n7. We have heard the learned counsel for the appellants in\n\ndetail, and carefully perused the record of the case.\n\nChallenge made to gift mutation - Suit Property No.1\n\n8. So far as the challenge made by the respondent to the gift\nmutation, which was statedly made by his father, Mawaz Khan, in favour\nof the respondent’s wife, Mst. Rabia Gula (appellant No.1), and his four\ndaughters, namely, Mst. Khan Khela, Khurseed Begum, Badshah\nZareena and Bibi Ghufran (appellants No.2 to 5), we note that the same has\nnot been correctly appreciated by the High Court in the impugned\n\njudgment for reasons discussed hereinunder.\n\nBar of limitation\n\n8.1 First and foremost, the bar of limitation applies to the\nchallenge made by the respondent to the gift mutation of 1977 after a\nperiod of 32 years, as concurrently held by the trial and appellate courts.\nThe said findings of the two courts have not been addressed by the\n\nRevisional Court in the impugned judgment.\n\n8.2 The respondent was claiming his right over the Suit Property\nNo.1 based on his inheritance from the estate of his father, and\n\nchallenged the gift mutation, essentially on the ground that the same\n\nCivil Appeal No. 139-P of 2013 4\n\nwas the result of fraud, and asserted that he gained knowledge thereof\nsome days before the institution of the suit. However, neither in the\nplaint nor in the evidence, did the respondent assert that his father, the\npurported donor, who remained alive for about 23 years after sanction of\nthe gift mutation, was not aware of the gift mutation and thus could not\nchallenge the same during his lifetime. This omission on the part of the\nrespondent, to our mind, was crucial and in fact, defeats the very legal\nbasis upon which he could have saved his claim from the bar of\n\nlimitation.\n\n8.3 Section 18 of the Limitation Act, 1908 (“Limitation Act”) is the\nmost pivotal provision providing relief in computing the limitation period,\napplicable to a person who claims to be deprived of the knowledge of his\nright to sue based on the fraud of the other party. That section is\n\nreproduced for ease of reference:\n\n18. Effect of fraud. Where any person having a right to institute a suit\nor make an application has, by means of fraud, been kept from the\nknowledge of such right or of the title on which it is founded, or where\nany document necessary to establish such right has been fraudulently\nconcealed from him, the time limited for instituting a suit or making an\napplication---\n(a) against the person guilty of the fraud or accessory thereto, or\n(b) against any person claiming through him otherwise than in\ngood faith and for a valuable consideration,\nshall be computed from the time when the fraud first became known to\nthe person injuriously affected thereby, or, in the case of the concealed\ndocument, when he first had the means of producing it or compelling its\nproduction.\n\nIn essence, this provision postpones the commencement of the limitation\nperiod in cases where a person is by means of fraud kept from the\nknowledge of his right to institute a suit. In such circumstances, the\nperiod of limitation commences from the date when the fraud first\nbecame known to the “person injuriously affected”. Such injuriously\naffected person can, therefore, institute a suit within the limitation\n\nperiod specified for such suit in the First Schedule (“Schedule”) to the\n\nCivil Appeal No. 139-P of 2013 5\n\nLimitation Act, but computing it from the date when he first had\nknowledge of the fraud, whereby he was kept from knowledge of his right\nto institute the suit. Thus, section 18 of Limitation Act is an umbrella\nprovision that makes the limitation period mentioned in the Articles of\nthe Schedule, begin to run from the time different from that specified\n\ntherein.!\n\n8.4 It is but fundamental to appreciate that the “fraud” stated in\nsection 18 of the Limitation Act must not be confused with the fraud that\nconstitutes cause of action, and creates a right to institute the suit for\nthe relief prayed therein. The “fraud” envisaged in section 18 only relates\nto concealing, not creating, the right to sue, and thus affects only the\nlimitation period, and has nothing to do with the cause of action and the\n\nrelief prayed.?\n\n8.5 It would, thus, be safe to hold that, when despite obtaining\nknowledge of such fraud and his right to sue, as mentioned in section\n18, the injuriously affected person does not institute the suit within the\nprescribed limitation period, no fresh period of limitation can be available\nto his legal heir(s) or any other person who derives his right to sue from\nor through him (the injuriously affected person);? for once the limitation\nperiod begins to run, it does not stop as per section 9 of the Limitation\n\nAct.\n\n8.6 Further, the definition of the term “plaintiff’, as given in\nsection 2(8) of the Limitation Act also has the effect of barring the fresh\nstart of the limitation period for the legal heir(s) or any other person, who\n\nderives his right to sue from or through such injuriously affected person,\n\n' Bashir Ahmed v. Muhammad Hussain PLD 2019 SC 504.\n? In Re: Marappa Goundar AIR 1959 Mad 26; Yeswant Deorao v. Walchand Ramchand AIR 1951 SC 16.\n3 Noor Muhammad v. Muhammad Miskeen 2009 SCMR 731.\n\nCivil Appeal No. 139-P of 2013 6\n\nas it provides that “plaintiff? includes any person from or through whom\n\na plaintiff derives his right to sue.\n\n8.7 Therefore, it is the date of knowledge of the “person\ninjuriously affected” of the fraud mentioned in section 18, and of his\nright to sue that is relevant for computing the limitation period, not of his\nlegal heir(s), unless he asserts and prove that his predecessor (the person\ninjuriously affected) never came to know of the fraud, whereby his right\nto institute the suit was concealed, in his lifetime; in the latter\neventuality, it is, of course, the knowledge of the present plaintiff (his\n\nsuccessor) that would be the starting point for the limitation to run.\n\n8.8 Needless to mention that, a plaintiff who wants to avail the\nbenefit of section 18 of the Limitation Act must assert the commission of\nsuch fraud by the defendant, in the plaint, and should also give the\nparticulars thereof, and the date of knowledge, as required under Rule 4\nof Order VI of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908, and then prove the same\n\nthrough positive evidence.*\n\n8.9 In the present case, the “person injuriously affected” by the\nalleged fraud (if it were committed) in getting the gift mutation\nsanctioned was the respondent’s father, Mawaz Khan (the purported\ndonor). The respondent derived his right to institute the suit to challenge\nthe gift mutation from his father, being his legal heir. It is, therefore, the\ndate of the knowledge of his father, not of the respondent that is the\nstarting point for computing the limitation period of six years provided in\n\nArticle 120 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act - the residuary Article\n\n4 Naeem Finance Ltd v. Bashir Ahmad PLD 1971 SC 8; Izzat Bakhsh v. Nazir Ahmad 1976 SCMR 508; Faizum v. Nander Khan\n2006 SCMR 1931; Bashir Ahmed v. Muhammad Hussain PLD 2019 SC 504.\n\nCivil Appeal No. 139-P of 2013 7\n\napplicable to suits instituted, under section 42 of the Specific Relief Act\n\n1877 (“Specific Relief Act”), for declaration of any right as to any property.\n\n8.10 In this regard, we note that the respondent (plaintiff) did not\nassert in the plaint that the appellants (defendants), by means of fraud,\nkept Mawaz Khan, his father (the person injuriously affected) from the\nknowledge of his right to institute the suit to challenge the gift mutation,\nduring his life, nor did he give the particulars thereof; what to say of\nproving the same. Furthermore, we note that the respondent (plaintiff)\ndid not assert any such fraud of the appellants even against himself, and\ngive any date of his attaining knowledge of such fraud and his right to\ninstitute the suit. Therefore, the benefit of section 18 of the Limitation\nAct for computing the limitation period for instituting the suit to\nchallenge the gift mutation cannot be extended to the respondent\n\n(plaintiff).\n\n8.11 Thus, the limitation period of six years provided in Article\n120 of the Limitation Act is to be computed from the time mentioned in\n\nthe said Article, that is, when the right to sue accrued. It reads:\n\nDescription of suit. Period of Time from which\nlimitation. period begins to run.\n\n120. Suit for which no period\nof limitation is provided | Six years. | When the right to\nelsewhere in this schedule. sue accrues.\n\nThe provision clearly declares that for computing the limitation, the\nperiod of six years would commence from the date of accrual of right to\nsue, but it does not state when such right accrues. To ascertain, when\ndoes the right to sue accrue to a donor, to seek a declaration of his\n\nownership right over the property shown to have been gifted and of his\n\nCivil Appeal No. 139-P of 2013 8\n\nsuch right not to be affected by the gift mutation, we have to consider\n\nanother provision of law, that is, section 42 of the Specific Relief Act.\n\n8.12 A suit for declaration of any right, as to any property is filed\n\nunder section 42 of the Specific Relief Act, which reads:\n\n42. Discretion of Court as to declaration of status or right-- Any\nperson entitled to any legal character, or to any right as to any property,\nmay institute a suit against any person denying, or interested to deny,\nhis title to such character or right, and the Court may in its discretion\nmake therein a declaration that he is so entitled, and the plaintiff need\nnot in such suit ask for any further relief:\n\nProvided that no Court shall make any such declaration where the\nplaintiff, being able to seek further relief than a mere declaration of title,\nomits to do so.\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\nIt becomes evident by reading the above provisions that the right to sue\naccrues to a person against the other for declaration of his right, as to\n\nany property, when the latter denies or is interested to deny his such\n\nright. It thus postulates two actions that cause the accrual of right to\nsue, to an aggrieved person: (i) actual denial of his right or (ii)\n\napprehended or threatened denial of his right.\n\n8.13 Now, what “actions” can be termed as an “actual denial of\nright”, and what a mere “apprehended or threatened denial of right”, in\nthe context of adverse entries recorded in the revenue record. It is\nimportant to note that a person may ignore an “apprehended or\nthreatened denial” of his right taking it not too serious to dispel that by\nseeking a declaration of his right through instituting a suit, and may\nexercise his option to institute the suit, when he feels it necessary to do\nso, to protect his right. For this reason, every “apprehended or\nthreatened denial” of right gives a fresh cause of action and right to sue\nto the person aggrieved of such apprehension or threat. However, this\noption to delay the filing of the suit is not available to him in case of\n\n“actual denial” of his right; where if he does not challenge the action of\n\nCivil Appeal No. 139-P of 2013 9\n\nactual denial of his right, despite having knowledge thereof, by seeking\ndeclaration of his right within the limitation period provided in the\nLimitation Act, then his right to do so becomes barred by law of\n\nlimitation.\n\n8.14 Admittedly, entries in the revenue record do not create or\nextinguish proprietary rights. Such an entry may at most be termed as a\nmere “apprehended or threatened denial” of right, and not an “actual\ndenial” of right. Accordingly, every new adverse entry in the revenue\nrecord relating to proprietary rights of a person in possession (actual or\nconstructive) of the land regarding which the wrong entry is made, gives\nto such person, a fresh cause of action to institute the suit for\n\ndeclaration.\n\n8.15 The situation is, however, different in a case where the\nbeneficiary of an entry in the revenue record also takes over the\npossession of the land on the basis of sale or gift transaction, as the case\nmay be, recorded in that entry. His action of taking over possession of\nthe land in pursuance of the purported sale or gift is certainly an “actual\ndenial” of the proprietary rights of the purported seller or donor.\nTherefore, in such a case, if the purported seller or donor does not\nchallenge that action of “actual denial” of his right, within the prescribed\nlimitation period, despite having knowledge thereof, then his right to do\n\nso becomes barred by law of limitation.\n\n8.16 In the present case, as per the revenue record and other\nevidence, the appellants, the purported donees, took over possession of\nthe Suit Property No.1 on the basis of gift transaction recorded in the gift\nmutation since the date of sanction of the gift mutation, that is,\n\n29.04.1977. Their act of taking over possession was an “actual denial” of\n\nCivil Appeal No. 139-P of 2013 10\n\nthe proprietary rights of the purported donor, therefore, it was necessary\nfor the purported donor to challenge the gift mutation (if it had been got\nsanctioned fraudulently) within the limitation period of six years provided\nin Article 120 or to seek recovery of the possession of the Suit Property\nNo.1 within the limitation period of twelve years as provided in Article\n142 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act, from that date. Mawaz Khan,\nthe donor, did not opt for any of the two, and allowed both possibly\napplicable periods of limitation to lapse during his lifetime, since he died\nin the year 2000 after about 23 years of the said act of taking over\npossession of the Property No.1 by the appellants. Therefore, no fresh\nlimitation period could be made available to his legal heir, the\nrespondent. Thus, the challenge made by the respondent in 2009 to the\ngift mutation of 1977, based on his inheritance rights from Mawaz Khan,\nwas clearly barred by time, as concurrently held by the trial and\nappellate courts, especially when the respondent is not found entitled to\nthe benefit of section 18 of the Limitation Act. This crucial issue was not\naddressed by the Revisional Court in the impugned judgment, hence, it\nwarrants interference by this Court in its appellate jurisdiction, in the\n\ninterest of justice.\n\nA reasonable and natural gift\n\n8.17 Although we need not look into the merits of the gift\ntransaction and gift mutation that followed, as the very suit to their\nextent has been held to be barred by law of limitation, yet we, in the\npeculiar circumstances of the case, are constrained to note that the gift\ntransaction recorded in the impugned gift mutation, as appropriately\nheld by the appellate court, appears to be reasonable and natural in the\n\nfacts and circumstances of the case; where a father, whose son had\n\nCivil Appeal No. 139-P of 2013 11\n\ncontracted a second marriage, transferred some of his property to his\nfirst daughter-in-law, who also happened to be his niece, and to his\ngranddaughters to ensure their financial security, out of his love and\n\naffection for them.\n\nChallenge made to sale mutation - Suit Property No.2\n\n9. As far the challenge made by the respondent, the purported\nseller of Suit Property No. 2, to the sale transaction and sale mutation\nthat followed, we note that once Muhammad Ibrar, his son and special\nattorney, appeared in the witness box as PW-3 and denied the making of\nthe sale transaction recorded in the sale mutation on his behalf, the\nevidential burden to prove the same by adducing affirmative evidence\nshifted on Mst. Khursheed Begum (appellant No.3), the beneficiary thereof.\nCarefully reviewing the evidence on the record, it is but clear that Mst.\nKhursheed Begum was unable to prove the essential ingredients of the\nsale transaction and the due sanction of the sale mutation that recorded\nit. Accordingly, we find the High Court is correct in its findings as to the\ninconsistencies and clear contradictions in the testimony of her two\nwitnesses, namely, Sultan-ul-Mulk (DW-1) and Wali-ur-Rehman (DW-2) on\nmaterial particulars of the sale transaction and of the sale mutation\nrecording the same in the revenue record. No independent witnesses, in\nparticular, the patwari who entered, and the revenue officer who\nsanctioned the sale mutation were examined in evidence. In fact, no\ncogent, reliable evidence was produced by Mst. Khursheed Begum\n(appellant No.3) to prove payment of the sale-consideration, the most\nessential ingredient of a valid sale, to the respondent. This being so, the\n\nHigh Court has correctly recorded its finding in the impugned judgment,\n\nCivil Appeal No. 139-P of 2013 12\n\nas to invalidity of the alleged sale of the Suit Property No. 2 and also of\n\nthe sale mutation.\n\n10. For the above reasons, we partially allow the appeal to the\nextent of gift mutation regarding Suit Property No.1, and dismiss it to the\nextent of the sale mutation regarding Suit Property No.2. The impugned\njudgment and decree are modified, accordingly. The suit of the\nrespondent to the extent of gift mutation regarding Suit Property No.1\nstands dismissed, and to the extent of the sale mutation regarding Suit\n\nProperty No. 2, decreed.\n\nJudge\n\nJudge\nAnnounced in open Court\n\nOn 25th February, 2022 at Islamabad\n\nJudge\n\nApproved for reporting\nArif", "CleanedText": "SECTION NOT FOUND: IN THE SUPREME COURT OF PAKISTAN Appellate Jurisdiction Present: Mr. Justice Qazi Faez Isa Mr. Justice Yahya Afridi Civil Appeal No. 139-P of 2013 Against the judgment dated 17.05.2013 of the Peshawar High Court, Peshawar in Civil Revision No. 68 of 2012 Mst.

We are not satisfied with the\norders passed by the Revenue Authorities from Tehsildar to EDO(R)\nand are in agreement with the decision of the Member, Board of\n\nRevenue.\n\n6.

Further, Board of Revenue\nis the highest court of appeal and revision in revenue cases and is a\ncontrolling authority in all matters connected with the administration\nof land, collection of land revenue, preparation of land record and other\nmatters (See section 5 of the Board of Revenue Act, 1957). In this\nbackground the courts after having judicially examined the remand\norder passed by the Board of Revenue have expressed reluctance to\ninterfere and for these reasons have maintained that order of remand\nwould not be amenable to writ jurisdiction (see Ramzan_v.\n\nRehabilitation Commissioner (Legal) Sargodha (PLD 1963 Lahore\n\n461), Kaniz Fatima v.

The forum to which the case is sent for fresh decision is free to re-examine the case and pass a fresh judgment. Against any such subsequent decision or judgment, alternate remedy is available to the parties. Further, Board of Revenue is the highest court of appeal and revision in revenue cases and is a controlling authority in all matters connected with the administration of land, collection of land revenue, preparation of land record and other matters See section 5 of the Board of Revenue Act, 1957 . In this background the courts after having judicially examined the remand order passed by the Board of Revenue have expressed reluctance to interfere and for these reasons have maintained that order of remand would not be amenable to writ jurisdiction see Ramzan v. Rehabilitation Commissioner Legal Sargodha PLD 1963 Lahore 461 , Kaniz Fatima v. Board of Revenue PLD 1973 Lahore 495 , and Ghulam Rasool v. Khudai Dad PLD 1986 Quetta 130 . This is not an absolute rule. An order of remand that is facially perverse or without jurisdiction or otherwise void can be interfered with, like any other order see Ghulam Rasool supra . The constitutional power to judicially review an order of remand passed by the Board of Revenue is not in any manner curtailed or abridged by the precedents cited above. Infact, the principle that emerges from the wisdom of the precedents is that, for reasons narrated above, the constitutional court must approach and examine a remand order passed by the Board of Revenue with care and circumspection, so as to sparingly interfere with it, unless of course, the remand order is facially perverse, without jurisdiction or otherwise void. Amenability of writ jurisdiction against a remand order is in this context and subject to above conditions. C.A No.1257/2013. 4 7.

The petition was allowed and the\namendment was set aside through impugned judgment dated\n\n06.08.2013.\n\n3. Challenging the said judgment, learned AAG on behalf\nof the petitioners, argued that the Provincial Government is\n\nempowered under Section 26 of the Ordinance to make Rules for the\n\nCP-570-P/2013 2\n\npurpose of carrying into effect the provisions of the Ordinance. As\nthe Ordinance relates to fisheries, the sale of “cooked or uncooked\nfish in commercial, market, shop, hotel,” etc falls within the domain\nof the Ordinance, hence the impugned amendment is intra vires the\n\nOrdinance.\n\n4. We have examined the question of law raised before us\nand have gone through the relevant law and the record of the case.\nThe respondents are private individuals, who deal in the sale of\ncooked and uncooked fish at Ghantaghar Bazaar, Peshawar.\nHowever, in order to answer the question raised, we have to first\n\nexamine the purpose, object and scope of the Ordinance.\n\n5. In common parlance, “Fishery” means a place where\nfish are reared, or caught in numbers or the occupation or industry of\ncatching or rearing fish. In legal parlance, “fishery” means right or\nliberty of taking fish.2 “Right of fishery,” generally means the right of\npersons to fish in public waters, subject to federal and state\nrestrictions and regulations, such as fishing seasons, licensing and\n\ncatch limits.3\n\n6. The Ordinance has been promulgated to regulate\n\nfisheries in the public waters in the Province. Under the Ordinance,\n\nright to catch fish in any public water can be leased out, subject to\nsuch conditions as may be prescribed. It further provides that no\nperson shall use or employ for the capture of any species of fish\n\nspecified in any water other than private water, or use any net or cage\n\n1 Concise Oxford English Dictionary. 12th Ed, p.536\n2 Black’s Law Dictionary, Ninth Edition, p. 712\n3 ibid\n\nCP-570-P/2013 3\n\nor trap or other contrivance for taking fish or fixed engine+ except\nduring the period permitted, in respect of such species, through a\nlicense issued under the Ordinance (see section 9). Regulating the\nsector further, the Ordinance prohibits destruction of fish by\nexplosives or destruction of fish by poisoning water and specifies the\nsize of fish which shall not be killed, captured or possessed (see\nsections 4, 6, 7 and 8). The licenses issued under the Ordinance are\nsubject to the payment of fee as prescribed under the Rules. The\nGovernment is also empowered to make Rules under Section 26,\n\ninter alia, to prescribe for fees to be charged for any license.\n\n7. The Ordinance provides for regulation of the right of\nfisheries in “water” as opposed to “private water’ which means water\nwhich is the exclusive property of any person...” Rules define the\n\nterm “public water” in the following manner:-\n“9(e) Public water means water other than the private water and\nincludes:\n\n(i) All natural bodies of water, such as rivers and their\ntributaries creeks, brooks, lakes, channels, canal or\nlagoons or dug, dredged or blasted canals;\n\nGi) Any water impounded by the construction of any lake\nor dam or other impounding device across the channel\n\nof navigable stream;\n\n(iii) Flowing water within which fish are free to move\nacross property limit and which are not by law or\ncustoms property of any person;”\n\nFrom the above it is abundantly clear that the purpose and object of\nthe Ordinance is to regulate fishery or the taking and catching of fish\nin public water. The Ordinance regulates public domain and deals\nwith public rights and has no concern with private water or any other\n\nprivate activity relating to fish.

The matters arise out of the Income Tax Ordinance, 1979\n(“Ordinance”) and the point in issue is the applicability or\notherwise of clause (9) of Part IV of the Second Schedule to that\nOrdinance (“Clause 9”). The Appellate Tribunal had decided against\nthe assessee (on the latter’s appeals) but, on a tax reference filed in\nthe High Court, the decision was reversed by means of the\nimpugned judgment. The department sought leave to appeal,\nwhich was granted vide order dated 15.04.2013. The assessment\nyears involved are 1994-95 and 1995-96.\n\n3. Clause 9 was added to the Ordinance in 1991. As originally\n\ninserted it was in the following terms (emphasis supplied):\n\n“(9) The provisions of section 80C in so far as they relate to\npayments on account of the supply of goods on which tax is\ndeductible under sub-section (4) of section 50 shall not apply\nin respect of any person, being a manufacturer of such\ngoods, who opts out of the presumptive tax regime:\n\nProvided that a declaration of final and irrevocable option is\nfurnished in writing alongwith the return of total income\nunder section 55:\n\nProvided further that nothing contained in this clause shall\n\napply to any manufacturer of goods for which special rates of\n\ndeduction of tax are specified under clause (c) of sub-section\n\n(4) of section 50.”\n\nSection 80C, also added in 1991, applied in terms as stated\ntherein a tax regime known as the “presumptive tax regime” (PTR).\nThis was in contradistinction to the “normal tax regime”, that\notherwise applied in relation to the assessment of income. By the\nFinance Act, 1996, the main paragraph of Clause 9 was amended\n\nso that it read as follows (emphasis supplied):\n\n“(9) The provisions of section 80C in so far as they relate to\npayments on account of the supply of goods on which tax is\ndeductible under sub-section (4) of section 50 shall not apply\nin respect of any person, being a manufacturer of such\ngoods, unless he opts for the presumptive tax regime:...”\n\nThus, for the words “who opts out of’, the words “unless he\n\nopts for” were substituted.\n\nCA 489, 490/2013 & 1302/2014 -13:-\n\n4. In the tax references filed by the respondent-assessee in the\nHigh Court, as many as nine questions of law were raised.\nHowever, the crucial question was No. VII, and leave was granted\nin this Court only to consider whether the said question (which\nwas answered in the affirmative) was correctly dealt with by the\n\nHigh Court. The said question was as follows:\n\n“That without prejudice to the all other questions whether\nthe amendment brought in Clause-9 part IV to the Second\nSchedule by way of replacing the phrase “who opts out of” by\nthe phrase “unless he opts for” is not correcting the mischief\nin clearing the ambiguity existing to save the assessment\nwho maintains proper account.”\n\nIn effect, the learned High Court treated this question as\nbeing whether or not the amendment made to Clause 9 by the\nFinance Act, 1996 would have retrospective effect in the facts and\ncircumstances of the case. The question was answered in the\n\naffirmative, in favor of the assessee and against the department.\n\n5. In the Appellate Tribunal, the facts as found by that forum\nwere that the assessee-appellant was issued with notices under s.\n66A on or about 05.10.1998 in relation to the assessment years\ninvolved, 1994-95 and 1995-96, on the ground that it had never\ngiven the option in writing as required by the first proviso to\nClause 9. The response initially given by the assessee, as presently\nrelevant, was that it had never given the option in writing.\nHowever, before the Tribunal the assessee changed course and\nproduced a letter dated 29.12.1994 that it had purportedly written\nto the concerned tax officer, which stated that the assessee was\nexercising the option as per the first proviso. This letter was\ndisregarded by the Tribunal as being an “afterthought” and\ninconsistent with the stance earlier taken. It was noted, inter alia,\nthat “the original is not available on the departmental record” and\n\nthat “it was not filed with the returns”.\n\n6. In the High Court, the assessee argued that the amendment\nmade to Clause 9 by the Finance Act, 1996 was declaratory or\nremedial in nature and therefore had retrospective effect. After\nconsidering what was meant, in law, by a declaratory or remedial\nstatute or amendment, the learned High Court concluded that it\n\nwas not “strictly remedial in nature” (emphasis in original).\n\nCA 489, 490/2013 & 1302/2014 -:4:-\n\nHowever, the learned Court then went on to hold that “the\namendment in Clause 9 is simply a change in the mode of\nassessment, thus procedural in nature”. It was also held as follows\n\n(emphasis in original):\n\n“What the amendment has actually done is to change the\nmode, which is procedural. No substantive right of the\nappellant has been affected, no new tax has been imposed\nand only the mode of assessment has been altered.\n\nThe procedural law, if altered and that too for the\nbenefit of the assessee then in such a case, the amendment\nwould be retrospective and applicable to cases, which are\npending before a forum prescribed by law.”\n\nOn the foregoing basis it was concluded that the amendment\nhad retrospective effect and, as noted, question No. VII was\n\nanswered in favor of the assessee.\n\n7. Before us, learned counsel for the appellant-department\nsubmitted that the assessee kept changing its stance, as found by\nthe Tribunal, and the “final” position that it sought to take before\nthat forum, namely that the option had been exercised, was\nrejected. That, it was submitted, was a finding of fact, which could\nnot be challenged further and, indeed, was not disturbed by the\nlearned High Court. It was also submitted that the learned High\nCourt had erred materially in concluding that Clause 9 was merely\nprocedural in nature. It was a substantive provision, and the\napplicability (or otherwise) of the clause materially altered the\n“regime” under which an assessee was to be treated, i.e., PTR or\nNTR. It could not therefore have retrospective effect. It was\nsubmitted that the Tribunal had correctly dealt with the matter,\nand its decision ought to be restored. Learned counsel for the\nrespondent-assessee submitted that the decision impugned was\n\ncorrect and that the appeal ought to be dismissed.\n\n8. After having heard learned counsel and considered the\nrelevant provisions and the record, we concluded that the appeals\nought to be allowed. The principal question was whether the\namendment made to Clause 9 in 1996 was procedural in nature\nand hence retrospective, as held by the learned High Court. Part IV\nof the Second Schedule to the Ordinance, as stated in s. 14(1)(d),\ncontained “exemptions from the operation of any provision of this\n\nOrdinance, subject to the conditions and to the extent specified\n\nCA 489, 490/2013 & 1302/2014 -15i-\n\ntherein”. Now, for present purposes, the provisions of the\nOrdinance could be regarded as having been either substantive or\nprocedural. A clause in Part IV could therefore be regarded as\nbeing substantive or procedural depending on the particular\nprovision of the Ordinance that it gave exemption from. The first\nquestion to consider therefore was whether s. 80C was a\n\nsubstantive provision or procedural in nature.\n\n9. Now, s. 80C was added by the Finance Act, 1991 and Clause\n9 was inserted a few months later by the Federal Government\nthrough SRO 829(I)/1991 dated 24.08.1991, in exercise of powers\nconferred by s. 14(2). Section 80C deemed certain payments, as\nspecified therein, as received by certain classes of persons (also as\nspecified) to be the income accruing to the latter and taxed them at\nspecified rates. For the payments that were within the ambit of the\nsection, the gross receipts (i.e., the payments themselves) became\nincome. Thus, the very thing that was the subject matter of the\nOrdinance and sought to be taxed in terms thereof, was being\ndirectly affected and altered. The legal meaning of “income” was\nchanged. Clearly, this was, and could only be, a substantive\nprovision. It followed that Clause 9, which granted an exemption\nfrom the operation of this deeming provision, was itself substantive\nin nature, since on the applicability or otherwise of the clause\ndepended whether the gross receipts in question were to be\n\ndeemed to be income.\n\n10. _ As originally inserted, Clause 9 gave the choice of opting out\nof s. 80C if the option, as given in terms of the first proviso, was\nproperly exercised. Thus, s. 80C applied unless the “opt-out” was\ntriggered. In other words, the legal meaning of income stood altered\nin respect of the payments within the ambit of s. 80C unless the\nassessee concerned took steps to the contrary. The amendment\nmade by the Finance Act, 1996 reversed this position. It now\nprovided that it was only if the option given in terms of the proviso\nwas exercised that s. 80C applied. In other words, the assessee\nhad to “opt-in” into the PTR. If the option was not exercised, the\nlegal meaning of income, even in respect of the payments within\nthe ambit of s. 80C, was not altered. Once this becomes clear it is\ndifficult, with respect, to see how, as held by the learned High\n\nCourt, the amendment could be regarded as procedural, having\n\nCA 489, 490/2013 & 1302/2014 -16:-\n\nretrospective effect. Prior to the amendment, the legal meaning of\nincome stood altered to the extent of s. 80C unless the assessee\ndid something. After the amendment, the legal meaning of income\ndid not stand altered unless the assessee did something. The two\nresultant situations were starkly different. Each had a substantive\neffect that was diametrically opposed to the other. With respect\ntherefore, the learned High Court erred materially in its answer to\nquestion No.VII. It ought to have been answered in favor of the\n\ndepartment and against the respondent. We so held.\n\n11. Once the conclusion was as just arrived at, the result was\nthat the impugned judgment was not sustainable. The point taken\nby learned counsel for the respondent, that the option had been\nexercised, was, with respect, not sustainable as it was contrary to\nthe finding of fact given by the Tribunal. That finding was not\ndisturbed by the learned High Court. The appeals had therefore to\nbe allowed, and this was announced at the conclusion of the\n\nhearing.\n\n12. The foregoing are the reasons for our short order.\n\nJudge\nJudge\nJudge\n\nIslamabad\n\n31.03.2021\n\nNaveed Ahmad/*\n\nApproved for reporting", "CleanedText": "JUDGMENT Munib Akhtar, J.: At the conclusion of the hearing, the following short order was made: CA 489, 490/2013 1302/2014 -12:- For the reasons to be recorded later, Civil Appeals No. 489490/2013 are allowed whereas Civil Appeal No. 1302/2014 is adjourned. 2.

On the foregoing basis it was concluded that the amendment had retrospective effect and, as noted, question No. VII was answered in favor of the assessee. 7. Before us, learned counsel for the appellant-department submitted that the assessee kept changing its stance, as found by the Tribunal, and the final position that it sought to take before that forum, namely that the option had been exercised, was rejected. That, it was submitted, was a finding of fact, which could not be challenged further and, indeed, was not disturbed by the learned High Court.

Learned counsel for the respondent-assessee submitted that the decision impugned was correct and that the appeal ought to be dismissed. 8. After having heard learned counsel and considered the relevant provisions and the record, we concluded that the appeals ought to be allowed. The principal question was whether the amendment made to Clause 9 in 1996 was procedural in nature and hence retrospective, as held by the learned High Court. Part IV of the Second Schedule to the Ordinance, as stated in s. 14 1 d , contained exemptions from the operation of any provision of this Ordinance, subject to the conditions and to the extent specified CA 489, 490/2013 1302/2014 -15itherein . Now, for present purposes, the provisions of the Ordinance could be regarded as having been either substantive or procedural. A clause in Part IV could therefore be regarded as being substantive or procedural depending on the particular provision of the Ordinance that it gave exemption from. The first question to consider therefore was whether s. 80C was a substantive provision or procedural in nature. 9. Now, s. 80C was added by the Finance Act, 1991 and Clause 9 was inserted a few months later by the Federal Government through SRO 829 I /1991 dated 24.08.1991, in exercise of powers conferred by s. 14 2 . Section 80C deemed certain payments, as specified therein, as received by certain classes of persons also as specified to be the income accruing to the latter and taxed them at specified rates. For the payments that were within the ambit of the section, the gross receipts i.e., the payments themselves became income. Thus, the very thing that was the subject matter of the Ordinance and sought to be taxed in terms thereof, was being directly affected and altered. The legal meaning of income was changed. Clearly, this was, and could only be, a substantive provision. It followed that Clause 9, which granted an exemption from the operation of this deeming provision, was itself substantive in nature, since on the applicability or otherwise of the clause depended whether the gross receipts in question were to be deemed to be income. 10. As originally inserted, Clause 9 gave the choice of opting out of s. 80C if the option, as given in terms of the first proviso, was properly exercised. Thus, s. 80C applied unless the opt-out was triggered. In other words, the legal meaning of income stood altered in respect of the payments within the ambit of s. 80C unless the assessee concerned took steps to the contrary. The amendment made by the Finance Act, 1996 reversed this position. It now provided that it was only if the option given in terms of the proviso was exercised that s. 80C applied. In other words, the assessee had to opt-in into the PTR. If the option was not exercised, the legal meaning of income, even in respect of the payments within the ambit of s. 80C, was not altered. Once this becomes clear it is difficult, with respect, to see how, as held by the learned High Court, the amendment could be regarded as procedural, having CA 489, 490/2013 1302/2014 -16:- retrospective effect. Prior to the amendment, the legal meaning of income stood altered to the extent of s. 80C unless the assessee did something. After the amendment, the legal meaning of income did not stand altered unless the assessee did something. The two resultant situations were starkly different.

cases, which are pending before a forum prescribed by law.", "On the foregoing basis it was concluded that the amendment had retrospective effect and, as noted, question No.", "VII was answered in favor of the assessee.", "Before us, learned counsel for the appellant-department submitted that the assessee kept changing its stance, as found by the Tribunal, and the final position that it sought to take before that forum, namely that the option had been exercised, was rejected.", "That, it was submitted, was a finding of fact, which could not be challenged further and, indeed, was not disturbed by the learned High Court.", "It was also submitted that the learned High Court had erred materially in concluding that Clause 9 was merely procedural in nature.", "It was a substantive provision, and the applicability or otherwise of the clause materially altered the regime under which an assessee was to be treated, i.e., PTR or NTR.", "It could not therefore have retrospective effect.", "It was submitted that the Tribunal had correctly dealt with the matter, and its decision ought to be restored.", "Learned counsel for the respondent-assessee submitted that the decision impugned was correct and that the appeal ought to be dismissed.", "After having heard learned counsel and considered the relevant provisions and the record, we concluded that the appeals ought to be allowed.", "The principal question was whether the amendment made to Clause 9 in 1996 was procedural in nature and hence retrospective, as held by the learned High Court.", "Part IV of the Second Schedule to the Ordinance, as stated in s. 14 1 d , contained exemptions from the operation of any provision of this Ordinance, subject to the conditions and to the extent specified CA 489, 490/2013 1302/2014 -15itherein .", "Now, for present purposes, the provisions of the Ordinance could be regarded as having been either substantive or procedural.", "A clause in Part IV could therefore be regarded as being substantive or procedural depending on the particular provision of the Ordinance that it gave exemption from.", "The first question to consider therefore was whether s. 80C was a substantive provision or procedural in nature.", "Now, s. 80C was added by the Finance Act, 1991 and Clause 9 was inserted a few months later by the Federal Government through SRO 829 I /1991 dated 24.08.1991, in exercise of powers conferred by s. 14 2 .", "Section 80C deemed certain payments, as specified therein, as received by certain classes of persons also as specified to be the income accruing to the latter and taxed them at specified rates.", "For the payments that were within the ambit of the section, the gross receipts i.e., the payments themselves became income.", "Thus, the very thing that was the subject matter of the Ordinance and sought to be taxed in terms thereof, was being directly affected and altered.", "The legal meaning of income was changed.", "Clearly, this was, and could only be, a substantive provision.", "It followed that Clause 9, which granted an exemption from the operation of this deeming provision, was itself substantive in nature, since on the applicability or otherwise of the clause depended whether the gross receipts in question were to be deemed to be income.", "As originally inserted, Clause 9 gave the choice of opting out of s. 80C if the option, as given in terms of the first proviso, was properly exercised.", "Thus, s. 80C applied unless the opt-out was triggered.", "In other words, the legal meaning of income stood altered in respect of the payments within the ambit of s. 80C unless the assessee concerned took steps to the contrary.", "The amendment made by the Finance Act, 1996 reversed this position.", "It now provided that it was only if the option given in terms of the proviso was exercised that s. 80C applied.", "In other words, the assessee had to opt-in into the PTR.", "If the option was not exercised, the legal meaning of income, even in respect of the payments within the ambit of s. 80C, was not altered.", "Once this becomes clear it is difficult, with respect, to see how, as held by the learned High Court, the amendment could be regarded as procedural, having CA 489, 490/2013 1302/2014 -16:- retrospective effect.", "Prior to the amendment, the legal meaning of income stood altered to the extent of s. 80C unless the assessee did something.", "After the amendment, the legal meaning of income did not stand altered unless the assessee did something.", "The two resultant situations were starkly different.", "Each had a substantive effect that was diametrically opposed to the other.", "With respect therefore, the learned High Court erred materially in its answer to question No.VII.", "It ought to have been answered in favor of the department and against the respondent.", "Once the conclusion was as just arrived at, the result was that the impugned judgment was not sustainable.", "The point taken by learned counsel for the respondent, that the option had been exercised, was, with respect, not sustainable as it was contrary to the finding of fact given by the Tribunal.", "That finding was not disturbed by the learned High Court.", "The appeals had therefore to be allowed, and this was announced at the conclusion of the hearing.", "The foregoing are the reasons for our short

Appellant\nVersus\n\nProvincial Government through Secretary ... Respondents\n\nBoard of Revenue, Government of\nBalochistan, Quetta, etc.\n\nFor the Appellant : Mr. Tariq Mehmood, Sr. ASC\nSyed Rifaqat Hussain Shah, AOR\nFor the Respondents : Mr. Ayaz Khan Swati, Additional\nAdvocate-General, Balochistan\nDate of Hearing : 15.09.2020\nJUDGMENT\n\nYAHYA AFRIDI, J- This Court vide its order dated 21-11-2013\n\nhad granted leave to appeal in the challenge made by Haji Wajdad\nagainst the judgment dated 07.08.2013 passed by the High Court\nof Balochistan, Quetta in Civil Revision No. 73 of 2008 in terms\nthat:\n\n“To consider the question as to whether the\nHigh Court while’ exercising revisional\njurisdiction could set aside the determination\nmade by the learned trial and appellate courts\nin the circumstances set out above, leave to\nappeal is granted”\n\nCivil Appeal No. 1522 of 2013 2\n\n2. The facts as asserted by the present appellant in his\nplaint are that he had inherited the suit property from his father\nbeing his sole heir and had since been in possession thereof. It was\nfurther averred that while he had gone abroad, he had left his\nrelative to look after the suit property. That a mutation was\nentered in favour of the Provincial Government in the year 1984.\nThe present appellant though not disclosing the specific date of\nknowledge of the impugned mutation only stated that a month\nprior to filing of the suit he obtained knowledge thereof. Aggrieved\nof the above impugned mutation, the appellant filed a suit for\ndeclaration with all consequential relief validating his title and\npossession over the suit property. The learned trial court framed\ntwo issues, and after recording of evidence of the parties, the trial\ncourt decreed the suit in favour of the appellant, which was\nmaintained by the appellate court. However, on the revision\npetition filed by the respondents, the High Court vide its impugned\norder set aside the judgments of the two courts passed in favour of\nthe present appellant. Hence, the petition before this court.\n\n3. The worthy counsel for the appellant vehemently\ncontended: that the revisional court had without cogent reasons\nset aside the concurrent findings of fact in favour of the present\nappellant; the appeal filed by the respondents was barred by time\nand the findings of the revisional court condoning the same being\nagainst a void order was contrary to the settled principle of law;\nand finally, that even if the limitation in filling the appeal is\ncondoned, the issues so framed by the trial court did not provide\nfor ownership and possession of the disputed property and, hence,\nwarranted remand of the case to the trial court. The worthy\nAdditional Advocate-General, Balochistan, present on behalf of the\nrespondents, vehemently opposed the contention of the worthy\ncounsel for the appellant.\n\n4. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and\nwith their valuable assistance have gone through the available\nrecord.\n\n5. There is no cavil to the principle that the revisional\n\ncourt, while exercising its jurisdiction under section 115 of the\n\nCivil Appeal No. 1522 of 2013 3\n\nCivil Procedure Code, 1908 (“CPC”), as a rule is not to upset the\nconcurrent findings of fact recorded by the two courts below. This\nprinciple is essentially premised on the touchstone that the\nappellate court is the last court of deciding disputed questions of\nfacts. However, the above principle is not absolute, and there may\nbe circumstances warranting exception to the above rule, as\nprovided under section 115 CPC: gross misreading or non-reading\nof evidence on the record; or when the courts below had acted in\nexercise of its jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity. !\n\n6. In the present case, it is noted that the revisional court\nwas correct in pointing out serious non-reading and mis-reading of\nevidence. The most crucial non-reading of evidence by the two\ncourt below was that Dadullah, father of the appellant, according\nto Abdul Lateef (PW2), was alive and present at the time of the\nimpugned mutation attested in favour of the Provincial\nGovernment, and that there was complete inaction on his part, and\nthat of the present appellant to legally agitate the impugned\nmutation. In addition, thereto, no credible evidence was produced\nby the present appellant to prove the possession of Dadullah or\nthat of the present appellant, over the disputed property. And yet,\nthe two courts below misread evidence and rendered a positive\nfinding of possession over the disputed property in favour of the\n\npresent appellant.\n\n1 Nazim-ud-Din and others Versus Sheikh Zia-ul-Qamar and others (2016 SCMR\n24)\nMandi Hassan alias Mehdi Hussain and another Versus Muhammad Arif (PLD\n2015 SC 137)\nNazir Ahmad and another Versus M. Muzaffar Hussain (2008 SCMR 1639)\nNabi Bakhsh Versus Fazal Hussain (2008 SCMR 1454)\nAbdul Hameed and others Versus Khalid and others (2007 SCMR 938)\nAbdul Sattar Versus Mst. Anar Bibi and others (PLD 2007 SC 609)\nAbdul Mateen Versus Mst. Mustakhia (2006 SCMR 50)\nHabib Khan and others Versus Mst. Bakhtmina and others (2004 SCMR 1668)\nGhulam Muhammad and 3 others Versus Ghulam Ali (2004 SCMR 1001)\n\nCivil Appeal No. 1522 of 2013 4\n\n7. The revisional court was also correct in declaring the\nsuit of the present appellant to be time barred being beyond six\nyears period provided under Article 120 of the Limitation Act, 1908\n(“Act”). It has by now been settled that, limitation would run even\nagainst void affecting rights of any person. And no one can seek\ncondonation of delay by challenging solely on the said basis. The\naggrieved person who files a belated claim against an alleged void\norder would have to first plead his knowledge thereof, and then\nprove the same by cogent and reliable evidence, so as to legally\njustify his such claim to be within the period of limitation from the\ndate of his knowledge.?\n\n8. In the present case, had the appellant proved\ncontinuous possession of the disputed property, his right to the\nproperty could have been treated as a continuing right*, and each\nof the successive entry in the Record of Rights (Jamabandi),\nrecording the Provincial Government to be the owner of the\ndisputed property would have given a fresh cause of action to the\nappellant to challenge the same.* The failure on the part of the\nappellant to prove continuous possession was, thus, fatal.\n\n9. We also note that there is a triple presumption of\ncorrectness attached to the impugned mutation: firstly, it was the\n\nresult of the first settlement (Bundubast) of the area®; secondly, the\n\n2 Gen. (R.) Parvez Musharraf Versus Nadeem Ahmed (Advocate) and another (PLD 2014 SC\n\n585), Messrs Blue Star Spinning Mills Ltd. Versus Collector of Sales Tax and others (2013\n\nSCMR 587), Ghulam Hussain Ramzan Ali Versus Collector of Customs (Preventive), Karachi\n\n(2014 SCMR 1594) and Raja Khan Versus Manager (Operation) Faisalabad Electric Supply\n\nCompany (WAPDA) and others (2011 SCMR 676)\n\n3 Khan Muhammad through L.Rs and others v. Mst. Khatoon Bibi and others (2017 SCM\n1476)\n\n4 Khan Muhammad through L.Rs and others v. Mst. Khatoon Bibi and others (2017 SCMR\n1476)\n\n5 Nawab Khan and others Versus Said Karim Khan and others (1997 SCMR 1840)\n\nCivil Appeal No. 1522 of 2013 5\n\nrecording of ownership was based on long standing mutations®;\nand finally, the recording was in favour of the provincial\ngovernment that was protected under section 52 of the Land\nRevenue Act, 1967. This presumption of correctness attached to\nsuch entries in the Revenue Record, is, however, rebuttable. The\njudicial consensus that has developed over time is that the said\npresumption, can not be controverted by mere oral evidence. To\nrebut the said presumption of correctness, sufficient and\nconvincing evidence must be produced.’\n\n10. We note that the appellant, in the present case, failed\nto bring on record, a single supportive entry reflecting his\npossession in the official revenue record or any other reliable piece\nof evidence. Moreover, the appellant also failed to bring any\npositive assertion confirming his possession or any other finding in\nhis favour during the cross examination of the official witness\nproduced by the respondents. Instead, the appellant only produced\ntwo private persons, whose standing in the area and credence of\ntheir testimony did not come up to the required threshold to dispel\nthe presumption of correctness attached to the impugned long\nstanding mutation.\n\n11. Moving on to the next contention of the learned\ncounsel for the appellant regarding the appeal of the respondents\nbeing time barred, and its legal effect on the impugned decision.\n\nThe reasoning recorded by the Revisional Court to condone the two\n\n6 Muhammad Khaliq v. Gul Afzal Khan (PLD 2015 SC 247); Mst. Phaphan through L.Rs. v.\nMuhammad Bakhsh and others (2005 SCMR 1278) (e as laid down in the cases of Mehr\nKhan v. Mst. Basaee (PLD 2008 SC 612) Hakim Khan. v. Aurangzeb & another (1979\nSCMR 625), Sundar Singh v. Chhajju Khan (AIR 1934 Lahore 309) and the Evacuee Trust\nProperty Board and others v. Haji Ghulam Rasool Khokhar and others (1990 SCMR 725).\n\n7 Muhammad Hussain v. Khuda Bukhsh 1989 SCMR 1563 Ghulam Haider v. Wali\nMuhammad 2008 SCMR 1428\n\nCivil Appeal No. 1522 of 2013 6\n\ndays delay in filing the appeal by the respondents was premised on\nthe ground that when the basic order of the trial court was void,\nthen the delay in filing of the appeal was of no legal effect. We find\nthis reasoning to be legally erred: the original order was passed by\na court of competent jurisdiction and, hence, the decision could\nnot be declared as void.\n\n12. As far as the legal effect of the above mentioned erred\nreasoning of the revisional court to condone the appeal of the\nrespondents, we note that the same shall not adversely affect the\nlegal correctness of the final out come of the impugned decision. In\nthis regard, we must appreciate that the Revisional Court under\nsection 115 CPC can exercise jurisdiction either on an application\nof an aggrieved person or suo motu to effectively correct any\nmaterial error of facts or law committed by any subordinate court.\nIn the present case, once the High Court was presented with the\nrevision petition of the respondents, the entire case (trial and\nappellate proceedings) was open for consideration to the court,\nwithout being restricted to the question of limitation of filing of\nappeal before the appellate. Seen in this perspective, the revision\npetition filed by the respondents could be deemed as an\n“information” to the Revisional Court, and it could then suo motu\nexercise its revisional jurisdiction with regard to the judgment of\nthe trial court, which it found to suffer from material irregularities.\nA larger bench of this court in Hafeez Ahmad’s case® has extensively\n\ndilated upon this suo motu authority of the High Court under\n\n8 Hafeez Ahmad Versus Civil Judge, Lahore (PLD 2012 Supreme Court 400)\n\nCivil Appeal No. 1522 of 2013 7\n\nsection 115, CPC, in relations to time barred petitions. It was\nopined that:\n\n“Such Court may exercise suo motu jurisdiction if the\nconditions for its exercise are satisfied. It is never\nrobbed of its suo motu jurisdiction simply because the\npetition invoking such jurisdiction is filed beyond the\nperiod prescribed therefor. Such petition, could be\ntreated as an information even if it suffers from\nprocedural lapses or loopholes. Revisional jurisdiction\nis pre-eminently corrective and supervisory, therefore,\nthere is absolutely no harm if the Court seized of a\nrevision petition, exercises its suo motu jurisdiction\nto correct the errors of the jurisdiction committed by\na subordinate Court. This is what can be gathered from\nthe language used in Section 115 of the Code and this\nis what was intended by the legislature, legislating it.\nIf this jurisdiction is allowed to go into the spiral of\ntechnicalities and fetters of limitation, the purpose\nbehind conferring it on the Court shall not only be\ndefeated but the words providing therefor, would be\nreduced to dead letters. It is too known to be\nreiterated that the proper place of procedure is to\nprovide stepping stones and not stumbling blocks in\nthe way of administration of justice. Since the\nproceedings before a revisional Court is a proceeding\nbetween the Court and Court, for ensuring strict\nadherence to law and safe administration of justice,\nexercise of suo motu jurisdiction may not be\nconveniently avoided or overlooked altogether. The\nCourt exercising such jurisdiction would fail in its\nduty if it finds an illegality or material irregularity in\nthe judgment of a subordinate Court and yet dismisses\n\nit on technical grounds.”\n\n13. As far as the contention of the worthy counsel for the\nappellant that the issues framed by the trial court were vague to\nthe extent of title and possession of the disputed property, we are\nafraid that, the said contention is devoid of merit. We note that\n\nissue No. 1 specifically relates to title and possession of the\n\nCivil Appeal No. 1522 of 2013 8\n\ndisputed property. More so, when the very claim of the present\nappellant was his title and continuous possession over the\ndisputed property, failing to produce any reliable cogent evidence\nin support thereof, is contrary to the principle of burden of proof as\nprovided under section 117 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984.\n13. Accordingly, for the reasons stated hereinabove, we\nnote that the final decision rendered by the revisional court is\nlegally correct in the circumstances of the case, and thus, warrant\n\nno interference. The present Appeal is dismissed.\n\nJudge\n\nJudge\nAnnounced in open Court\nOn 02.10.2020 at Islamabad\n\nJudge\nApproved for reporting\n\nArif", "CleanedText": "JUDGMENT YAHYA AFRIDI, JThis Court vide its order dated 21-11-2013 had granted leave to appeal in the challenge made by Haji Wajdad against the judgment dated 07.08.2013 passed by the High Court of Balochistan, Quetta in Civil Revision No. 73 of 2008 in terms that: To consider the question as to whether the High Court while exercising revisional jurisdiction could set aside the determination made by the learned trial and appellate courts in the circumstances set out above, leave to appeal is granted Civil Appeal No. 1522 of 2013 2 2. The facts as asserted by the present appellant in his plaint are that he had inherited the suit property from his father being his sole heir and had since been in possession thereof. It was further averred that while he had gone abroad, he had left his relative to look after the suit property. That a mutation was entered in favour of the Provincial Government in the year 1984. The present appellant though not disclosing the specific date of knowledge of the impugned mutation only stated that a month prior to filing of the suit he obtained knowledge thereof. Aggrieved of the above impugned mutation, the appellant filed a suit for declaration with all consequential relief validating his title and possession over the suit property. The learned trial court framed two issues, and after recording of evidence of the parties, the trial court decreed the suit in favour of the appellant, which was maintained by the appellate court. However, on the revision petition filed by the respondents, the High Court vide its impugned order set aside the judgments of the two courts passed in favour of the present appellant. Hence, the petition before this court. 3. The worthy counsel for the appellant vehemently contended: that the revisional court had without cogent reasons set aside the concurrent findings of fact in favour of the present appellant; the appeal filed by the respondents was barred by time and the findings of the revisional court condoning the same being against a void order was contrary to the settled principle of law; and finally, that even if the limitation in filling the appeal is condoned, the issues so framed by the trial court did not provide for ownership and possession of the disputed property and, hence, warranted remand of the case to the trial court. The worthy Additional Advocate-General, Balochistan, present on behalf of the respondents, vehemently opposed the contention of the worthy counsel for the appellant. 4. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and with their valuable assistance have gone through the available record. 5. There is no cavil to the principle that the revisional court, while exercising its jurisdiction under section 115 of the Civil Appeal No. 1522 of 2013 3 Civil Procedure Code, 1908 CPC , as a rule is not to upset the concurrent findings of fact recorded by the two courts below. This principle is essentially premised on the touchstone that the appellate court is the last court of deciding disputed questions of facts. However, the above principle is not absolute, and there may be circumstances warranting exception to the above rule, as provided under section 115 CPC: gross misreading or non-reading of evidence on the record; or when the courts below had acted in exercise of its jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity. ! 6. In the present case, it is noted that the revisional court was correct in pointing out serious non-reading and mis-reading of evidence. The most crucial non-reading of evidence by the two court below was that Dadullah, father of the appellant, according to Abdul Lateef PW2 , was alive and present at the time of the impugned mutation attested in favour of the Provincial Government, and that there was complete inaction on his part, and that of the present appellant to legally agitate the impugned mutation. In addition, thereto, no credible evidence was produced by the present appellant to prove the possession of Dadullah or that of the present appellant, over the disputed property. And yet, the two courts below misread evidence and rendered a positive finding of possession over the disputed property in favour of the present appellant. 1 Nazim-ud-Din and others Versus Sheikh Zia-ul-Qamar and others 2016 SCMR 24 Mandi Hassan alias Mehdi Hussain and another Versus Muhammad Arif PLD 2015 SC 137 Nazir Ahmad and another Versus M. Muzaffar Hussain 2008 SCMR 1639 Nabi Bakhsh Versus Fazal Hussain 2008 SCMR 1454 Abdul Hameed and others Versus Khalid and others 2007 SCMR 938 Abdul Sattar Versus Mst.

Bakhtmina and others 2004 SCMR 1668 Ghulam Muhammad and 3 others Versus Ghulam Ali 2004 SCMR 1001 Civil Appeal No. 1522 of 2013 4 7. The revisional court was also correct in declaring the suit of the present appellant to be time barred being beyond six years period provided under Article 120 of the Limitation Act, 1908 Act . It has by now been settled that, limitation would run even against void affecting rights of any person. And no one can seek condonation of delay by challenging solely on the said basis. The aggrieved person who files a belated claim against an alleged void order would have to first plead his knowledge thereof, and then prove the same by cogent and reliable evidence, so as to legally justify his such claim to be within the period of limitation from the date of his knowledge.? 8. In the present case, had the appellant proved continuous possession of the disputed property, his right to the property could have been treated as a continuing right , and each of the successive entry in the Record of Rights Jamabandi , recording the Provincial Government to be the owner of the disputed property would have given a fresh cause of action to the appellant to challenge the same. The failure on the part of the appellant to prove continuous possession was, thus, fatal. 9. We also note that there is a triple presumption of correctness attached to the impugned mutation: firstly, it was the result of the first settlement Bundubast of the area ; secondly, the 2 Gen. R. Parvez Musharraf Versus Nadeem Ahmed Advocate and another PLD 2014 SC 585 , Messrs Blue Star Spinning Mills Ltd.

This presumption of correctness attached to such entries in the Revenue Record, is, however, rebuttable. The judicial consensus that has developed over time is that the said presumption, can not be controverted by mere oral evidence. To rebut the said presumption of correctness, sufficient and convincing evidence must be produced. 10. We note that the appellant, in the present case, failed to bring on record, a single supportive entry reflecting his possession in the official revenue record or any other reliable piece of evidence. Moreover, the appellant also failed to bring any positive assertion confirming his possession or any other finding in his favour during the cross examination of the official witness produced by the respondents. Instead, the appellant only produced two private persons, whose standing in the area and credence of their testimony did not come up to the required threshold to dispel the presumption of correctness attached to the impugned long standing mutation. 11. Moving on to the next contention of the learned counsel for the appellant regarding the appeal of the respondents being time barred, and its legal effect on the impugned decision. The reasoning recorded by the Revisional Court to condone the two 6 Muhammad Khaliq v. Gul Afzal Khan PLD 2015 SC 247 ; Mst. Phaphan through L.Rs. v. Muhammad Bakhsh and others 2005 SCMR 1278 e as laid down in the cases of Mehr Khan v. Mst. Basaee PLD 2008 SC 612 Hakim Khan. v. Aurangzeb another 1979 SCMR 625 , Sundar Singh v.

Khuda Bukhsh 1989 SCMR 1563 Ghulam Haider v. Wali Muhammad 2008 SCMR 1428 Civil Appeal No. 1522 of 2013 6 days delay in filing the appeal by the respondents was premised on the ground that when the basic order of the trial court was void, then the delay in filing of the appeal was of no legal effect. We find this reasoning to be legally erred: the original order was passed by a court of competent jurisdiction and, hence, the decision could not be declared as void. 12. As far as the legal effect of the above mentioned erred reasoning of the revisional court to condone the appeal of the respondents, we note that the same shall not adversely affect the legal correctness of the final out come of the impugned decision. In this regard, we must appreciate that the Revisional Court under section 115 CPC can exercise jurisdiction either on an application of an aggrieved person or suo motu to effectively correct any material error of facts or law committed by any subordinate court. In the present case, once the High Court was presented with the revision petition of the respondents, the entire case trial and appellate proceedings was open for consideration to the court, without being restricted to the question of limitation of filing of appeal before the appellate. Seen in this perspective, the revision petition filed by the respondents could be deemed as an information to the Revisional Court, and it could then suo motu exercise its revisional jurisdiction with regard to the judgment of the trial court, which it found to suffer from material irregularities. A larger bench of this court in Hafeez Ahmad s case has extensively dilated upon this suo motu authority of the High Court under 8 Hafeez Ahmad Versus Civil Judge, Lahore PLD 2012 Supreme Court 400 Civil Appeal No. 1522 of 2013 7 section 115, CPC, in relations to time barred petitions. It was opined that: Such Court may exercise suo motu jurisdiction if the conditions for its exercise are satisfied. It is never robbed of its suo motu jurisdiction simply because the petition invoking such jurisdiction is filed beyond the period prescribed therefor. Such petition, could be treated as an information even if it suffers from procedural lapses or loopholes. Revisional jurisdiction is pre-eminently corrective and supervisory, therefore, there is absolutely no harm if the Court seized of a revision petition, exercises its suo motu jurisdiction to correct the errors of the jurisdiction committed by a subordinate Court. This is what can be gathered from the language used in Section 115 of the Code and this is what was intended by the legislature, legislating it. If this jurisdiction is allowed to go into the spiral of technicalities and fetters of limitation, the purpose behind conferring it on the Court shall not only be defeated but the words providing therefor, would be reduced to dead letters. It is too known to be reiterated that the proper place of procedure is to provide stepping stones and not stumbling blocks in the way of administration of justice. Since the proceedings before a revisional Court is a proceeding between the Court and Court, for ensuring strict adherence to law and safe administration of justice, exercise of suo motu jurisdiction may not be conveniently avoided or overlooked altogether. The Court exercising such jurisdiction would fail in its duty if it finds an illegality or material irregularity in the judgment of a subordinate Court and yet dismisses it on technical grounds. 13. As far as the contention of the worthy counsel for the appellant that the issues framed by the trial court were vague to the extent of title and possession of the disputed property, we are afraid that, the said contention is devoid of merit. We note that issue No. 1 specifically relates to title and possession of the Civil Appeal No. 1522 of 2013 8 disputed property. More so, when the very claim of the present appellant was his title and continuous possession over the disputed property, failing to produce any reliable cogent evidence in support thereof, is contrary to the principle of burden of proof as provided under section 117 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. 13. Accordingly, for the reasons stated hereinabove, we note that the final decision rendered by the revisional court is legally correct in the circumstances of the case, and thus, warrant no interference. The present Appeal is dismissed.

This Constitutional\n\nPetition was filed before this Court in 2013 seeking\nenforcement of Fundamental Rights guaranteed to\ncitizens under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of\nPakistan, 1973 (“the Constitution”). It was filed by\nprominent Members of Disability Movement in Pakistan\nwho had been striving hard for many years for the\nwelfare of persons with disabilities in the country. It was\nstated that millions of Pakistani citizens suffering from\nvarious disabilities were being denied Fundamental\n\nRights guaranteed to them under the Constitution.\n\n\nConstitution Petition No.64 of 2013 4\n\n2. This Court being guardian of the F undamental\nRights guaranteed to the citizens was approached under\nArticle 184(3) of the Constitution. It was pointed out to\nus that global movement for rights of the disabled\npersons had resulted in drafting of the United Nations\nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities\n(UNCRPD). Pakistan had ratified the same. However,\ndespite such ratification, disabled persons continue to\nsuffer as most neglected, marginalized and\nunrepresented segment of the society who face serious\nand insurmountable barriers against their inclusion in\n\nthe mainstream society.\n\n3. We are also informed that no officially reliable\ninformation regarding the number of persons suffering\nfrom various disabilities was available. Although the\nDisabled Persons (Employment & Rehabilitation)\nOrdinance, 1981 (“the Ordinance, 191%) is in the field,\nthe said law has neither been updated periodically nor\nhas the same been implemented. It also appears that\nDirectorate General of Special Education was formed in\n1985 for provision of Special Education to persons with\ndisabilities in order to educate them to facilitate their\nassimilation in the mainstream but no significant\n\nprogress seems to have been made. It further appears\n\nthat the National Policy for Persons with Disabilities\n\n\nConstitution Petition No.64 of 2013 5\n\ntoade in 2002 and the National Plan of Action, 2006 to\nimplement the said Policy of 2002 has not produced the\n\nrequisite results.\n\n4. When hearing in this matter started, all\nstakeholders were summoned. We were assisted amongst\nothers by the learned Attorney General for Pakistan as\nwell as learned Advocate Generals of all four Provinces\nand the learned Advocate General, Gilgit Baltistan who\nfiled periodical reports on behalf of the Federal and\nProvincial Governments. Input from interested private\n\ncitizens was also received and considered.\n\n5. In the post Eighteenth Constitutional\nAmendment scenario, the subjects of Population\nPlanning, Social Welfare, Mental Illness and Mental\nRetardation have devolved on the Provinces. Some\nlegislation has taken place in the Provinces of Punjab and\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa. Sindh and Balochistan are in the\nprocess of putting the requisite legislation in place. It is\nalso significant to note that there is no reliable data.\nregarding incidence of disabilities in Pakistan. However,\naccording to the data furnished by Pakistan Poverty\n-Alleviation Fund, 66% of persons with disabilities live in\nRural areas, 28% are illiterate, 14% are employed and\n70% are dependent on members of their families for\n\nfinancial support. It was pointed out to us that the\n\n\nFederal Government had failed to take appropriate steps\nto facilitate the lives of people with disabilities by\nproviding them education, jobs and medical facilities and\n\nease their daily lives in a manner visualized in the United\n\nNations Convention (UNCRPD). It was also pointed out\n\nthat provisions of the Ordinance, 1981 were not being\nimplemented with regard to allocation of quota in jobs\nand the dream of peeing inchasion: in mainstream,\nsocial life, education and abolition of disenfranchisement\nof people with disabilities remained unfulfilled. Even\nbasic facilities like obtaining special national identity\n\ncards were not available to the persons with disabilities.\n\n6. This matter was taken up at regular intervals\nowing to tripe issues raised and this Court on the\nbasis of information furnished by all stakeholders passed\norders and directed implementation. Appropriate\ndirections were also issued relating to collection of data of\nthe disabled persons on regular basis and in this regard\nPakistan Bureau of Statistics was tasked with the\n\nresponsibility to devise a suitable mechanism to do so.\n\nDirections were also issued not only to upload such data\n\non the official website of the concerned Ministry but also\nto update it on periodical. basis. Orders were passed\ndirecting the concerned Ministries and other Government\nAgencies to-implement all applicable laws regarding\n\nemployment of disabled persons in accordance with the\n\n\nquotas allocated in the law. It was noticed that a large\nnumber of posts reserved for persons with disabilities\nwere either lying vacant or had been occupied by persons\nwho though not disabled had produced false and\nfabricated certificates in order to get jobs on the disability\nquotas. Under directions of this Court, an exercise was\nundertaken to address the said situation. According to\nthe reports submitted with this Court, the said issue has\n\nbeen addressed and appropriate action is being taken.\n\na It sels also pointed out to us that concessional\ntravel rates by Train and Air were not being allowed to\npersons with disabilities. However, on our directions the\nrequisite steps were taken and the grievances appear to\nhave been redressed. We expect that the concerned\nAgencies sit be vigilant to ensure that Pakistan Airlines\nas well as Pakistan Railways not only allow such\nconcession but the availability of this facility is advertised\nthrough public service messages in the Print and\nElectronic Media with the assistance and consultation of\n\nPEMRA.\n\n8. During the course of hearing, we have also\n-noticed that there is a lack of coordination and\ncooperation between the Federal and Provincial\nGovernments in implementing all laws relating to welfare\n\nof disabled persons. We are sanguine that every possible\n\n\nConstitution Petition No.G4 of 2013 g\n\neffort will be made to improve and streamline the\ncoordination and cooperation of the Federal and\nProvincial Governments so that the relevant laws are not\n\nonly made and updated but also vigorously implemented.\n\na When this matter was taken up on\n05.03.2020, copies of reports filed by the learned\nAttorney General for Pakistan and all four Provinces as\nwell as Gilgit Baltistan were examined. Some of the\nlearned counsel had sought time to examine the reports\nand assist this Court in the matter. Copies of all reports\n\nwere accordingly directed to be supplied to them.\n\nTO, 2 We have heard: the learned counsel for the\npetitioners, aetna of the petitioners in person and the\nlearned: Law Officers appearing for the Federation as well\nas the Provinces. We are satisfied that the broad\nframework of guidelines provided by this Court from time\nto time to ensure implementation of laws and providing\nFundamental Rights to persons with disabilities are being\nfollowed and implemented by the Federal as well as the\nProvincial Governments. Much more needs to be done. It\nis however encouraging to note that the process has been\ninitiated and earnest efforts are being made to create an\nenvironment and framework where citizens with\ndisabilities are given respect, protection and support and\n\nthe requisite facilities are also made available to provide\n\n\nConstitution Petition No.G4 of 2013 9\nthem opportunities of getting education, training and a\nconducive environment where they can be assimilated in\n\nthe mainstream of the society.\n\nvee Although the requisite guidelines and\ndirections have been issued by this Court from time to\ntime, we consider it appropriate to reiterate the same and\nincorporate them in a consolidated form in the final order\nof this Court. Accordingly, the following directions and\nguidelines are issued to the Federal and Provincial\nGovernments and all concerned Ministries, Divisions,\nDepartments, Agencies, Authorities and other entities\nwerd in connection with the affairs of the Federation,\n\nthe Provinces or any local authorities:\n\ni) All vacant posts in the employment quota of Federal\nGovernment as well as Provincial Governments should be\nadvertised and filled. It must be ensured that disabled\npersons from the same area/region are\n\naccommodated/ appointed against regional quotas;\n\nii) The provisions of laws relating to rehabilitation and\nemployment of the disabled persons be followed and\n\nimplemented in letter and spirit;\n\niti) The Federal and Provincial Governments are directed to\nensure establishment of grievance redressal mechanisms to\nredress grievances of disabled persons and awareness\ncampaigns regarding availability of these grievance\n\nredressal mechanism be run;\n\niv) The Federal Government, Provincial Governments, PEMRA,\nPTV, PBA and PBS will raise awareness through public\n\nservice broadcasts of programs or messages;\n\nv) The Federal and Provincial Governments as well as\ndevelopment authorities shall ensure enforcement of the\nAccessibility Code, 2006;\n\n\nLitution Petition No.64 o;\n\n_ vi)\nvii)\n\nviii)\n\nix)\n\n4)\n\nxd)\n\nxii)\n\nxiii)\n\n0,\n\n10\nRoad Transport Authorities are directed to ensure making\n\npublic transport accessible Sor persons with disabilities;\n\nPakistan Railways shall progressively build proper Tramps\nat Train Stations;\n\nThe transport and development authorities will ensure\navailability of accessible toilets at train Stations, local bus\nstands, service areas of bus stations, motorways and\n\nhighways;\n\nThe transport and development authorities shall arrange for\nconstruction of ramps and arrange safe and reliable\nfacilities for boarding of buses and trains by disabled\npersons;\n\nThe concerned authorities and agencies at the Federal as\nwell as Provincial level shall make appropriate\narrangements for the following:\n\na) Availability of accessible parking and ramps at public\nparks; and\n\nb) Provision of accessible washroom and ramps in malls,\nparis, public places.\n\nAll development authorities will ensure enforcement of\nquota in allotment of residential plots and houses as\n\nprovided in the relevant laws, rules and regulations;\n\nDirections are also issued to all concerned to implement\norder of this Court dated 11.10.2018 in letter and spirit;\n\nand\n\nPakistan Bureau of Statistics in consultation with NADRA\nand other departments and agencies of the Federal and\nProvincial Governments shall publish and periodically\nupdate, complete, accurate and updated figures and\nstatistics regarding persons with disabilities and upload\n\nthe same on its website.\n\n12.

JUSTICE MAZHAR ALAM KHAN MIANKHEL\n\nC.R.P.NO.218 OF 2013 IN C.P.NO.1033 OF 2013\n(On review of this Court’s order dated 09.07.2013\npassed in C.P.No.1033/2013)\n\nAllah Dino Khan Bhayo\n...Petitioner(s)\nVERSUS\n\nElection Commission of Pakistan etc.\n...Respondent(s)\n\nFor the petitioner(s): Mr. Wasim Sajjad, Sr. ASC\nFor Federation of Ch. Aamir Rehman, Additional Attorney\nPakistan: General\nFor ECP: Mr. M. Arshad, D.G. Law\nFor respondent No.5: Raja M. Ibrahim Satti, Sr. ASC\nDate of hearing: 04.02.2020\nORDER\n\nUMAR ATA BANDIAL, J.- The question in issue is\n\nwhether a finding dated 03.12.2007 given by the Returning Officer\nagainst the petitioner in summary proceedings held for scrutiny of\nnomination papers during general elections is final and binding for\nthe purpose of permanently disqualifying the petitioner from\ncontesting any general election under Article 62(1)(f) of the\nConstitution. The said finding concludes that the equivalence\ncertificate issued by Shah Abdul Latif University, Khairpur about the\npetitioner’s claimed sanad was fake thereby disqualifying the\npetitioner from contesting the election from PS-12 Shikarpur-II in\n\n2008. As a result, the petitioner stepped out of the elections and did\n\nC.R.P.No.218 of 2013 in C.P.No.1033 of 2013 = 2:-\n\nnot challenge the finding by the Returning Officer. In 2007 Article\n62(1)(f) of the Constitution read as follows:\n“62. A person shall not be qualified to be\n\nelected or chosen as a member of Majlis-e-\nShoora (Parliament) unless —\n\n0) he is sagacious, righteous and _ non-\nprofligate and honest and ameen”\n\nHowever, the 18tt Amendment to the Constitution amended Article\n62(1)(f) in the year 2010 to incorporate a condition that only a\ndeclaration, inter alia, of dishonesty given by a court of law could\ndisqualify a candidate from contesting elections to the Parliament or\na Provincial Assembly. The amended Constitutional provision reads\nas under:\n\n“62. (1) A person shall not be qualified to be\n\nelected or chosen as a member of Majlis-e-\nShoora (Parliament) unless —\n\n0) he is sagacious, righteous and _ non-\nprofligate, honest and ameen, there being no\ndeclaration to the contrary by a court of law”\n\n2. The petitioner got elected as a member of the Sindh\nProvincial Assembly in the year 2013. However, on a complaint filed\nagainst him, the Election Commission of Pakistan (“ECP”) in exercise\nof its powers under Section 103-AA of the Representation of People\nAct, 1976 (“ROPA”) declared vide order dated 11.06.2013 that the\npetitioner was disqualified, inter alia, under Article 62(1)(f) of the\nConstitution to contest in the general election of 2013. The decision\n\nwas based on the aforementioned finding recorded against the\n\nC.R.P.No.218 of 2013 in C.P.No.1033 of 2013 :3:\n\npetitioner by the Returning Officer on 03.12.2007 which had ousted\nhim from the corresponding general election held in 2008. The\npetitioner’s challenge to the said finding was ultimately rejected by\nthis Court which upheld the order of the ECP vide judgment dated\n\n09.07.2013 reported as Allah Dino Khan Bhayo Vs. Election\n\nCommission of Pakistan, Islamabad _ and others (2013 SCMR\n\n1655).\n\n3. In this review against our judgment dated 09.07.2013,\nthe question for our consideration is whether the finding by the\nReturning Officer given during scrutiny of nomination papers\nqualifies as a declaration given by a court of law within the terms of\nArticle 62(1)(f) of the Constitution. This is important because by the\nyear 2013 a few judgments by the Supreme Court including Malik\n\nIqbal Ahmad Langrial Vs. Jamshed Alam (PLD 2013 SC 179) and\n\nAbdul Ghafoor Lehri Vs. Returning Officer, PB-29 (2013 SCMR\n\n1271) had interpreted and held the unamended terms of Article\n\n62(1)(f) to permanently disqualify a non-compliant candidate.\n\n4. Both sides have relied upon the judgment delivered by a\n\nlarger bench of this Court reported as Sami Ullah Baloch and others\n\nVs. Abdul Karim Noursherwani and others (PLD 2018 SC 405) to\n\nadvance their rival pleas with respect to the review of our judgment\ndated 09.07.2013. Learned counsel for the petitioner has referred the\nsaid authority to assert that the petitioner’s disqualification under\nArticle 62(1)(f) of the Constitution cannot be permanent unless his\ndisability under the said Article is declared by a court of law.\n\nConversely, the respondents claim that our above mentioned\n\njudgment in the Sami Ullah Baloch case has approved our judgment\n\ndated 09.07.2013 that is now under review before us. The\n\nC.R.P.No.218 of 2013 in C.P.No.1033 of 2013 :4:\n\nendorsement by the larger Bench has fortified the view expressed in\n\nthe judgment under review. In Sami Ullah Baloch’s case this Court\n\naffirmed the rule that Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution creates a\npermanent bar against contesting the general election. However, the\nimpact of the change made by the 18 Amendment in Article 62(1)(f)\nof the Constitution and its legal effect was noted in paragraph 23 of\n\nthe said judgment. This is reproduced as below:\n\n“23. ...In the present context, the conditions\nand qualifications in Article 62(1)(f) of the\nConstitution were retained in toto; and made\nobjectively and transparently enforceable by\nthe prescription of a judicial declaration for\nprecipitating the loss of the _ electoral\nqualification specified in the said clause.\nWhere a declaration made by a Court of law\n\nagainst a candidate for election warrants a\nconclusion of his misrepresentation,\n\ndishonesty, breach of trust, fraud, cheating,\nlack of fiduciary duty, conflict of interest,\ndeception, dishonest misappropriation, etc. to\nbe derived from such a verdict, then it stands\n\nto reason that the consequential incapacity\nimposed upon the candidate for election\nshould last for as long as the declaration is in\n\nforce.”\n\n(emphasis added)\n\nThe foregoing view with respect to a judicial declaration is elaborated\n\nin paragraph 35 of the judgment which holds that:\n\n“35. It is clear from the findings recorded in\nthe afore-noted four judgments by this Court\nthat the absence of a time limit for the\nineligibility of a candidate for election in Article\n62(1)(f) of the Constitution is the basis for\nholding his incapacity to be incurable by efflux\nof time. The reasons recorded in our judgment\nreinforce that conclusion. It may also be noted\n\nC.R.P.No.218 of 2013 in C.P.No.1033 of 2013 = 5:\n\nthat the Constitution envisages other\nsituations in which a permanent bar to the\neligibility of a candidate for election is enforced\nso long as the judgment that records or\njustifies the disability of the candidate remains\nin existence and occupies the field. This view is\nsupported by Articles 63 (1)(a) and 63(1)(b) of\nthe Constitution that provide disqualifications\non account of judicial declaration regarding the\nmental unfitness or the  undischarged\ninsolvency of a candidate for election. These\ndisabilities also continue so long as_ the\nadverse judgment is in the field. Finally, it may\nbe noted that the prescription by the 18th\nConstitutional Amendment of an adverse\njudicial declaration to precipitate _ the\n\nineligibility of a candidate for election has\n\nprovided a lawful, transparent and _ fair\n\nmechanism to a candidate under challenge\n\nboth for contesting and for avoiding the onset\n\nof an embargo on _ his eligibility to contest\n\nelections. The restriction imposed by Article\n62(1)(f) of the Constitution for the eligibility of\na candidate for election to Parliament serves\nthe public need and public interest for honest,\nupright, truthful, trustworthy and prudent\nelected representatives. The judicial\nmechanism in Article 62(1)(f) of the\nConstitution grants a fair opportunity and\n\nadequate remedy for relief to a candidate under\n\nchallenge to vindicate himself.”\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n5. The upshot of the said judgment is that a disqualification\nunder Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution can only be imposed by or\nunder a declaration made by a court of law. By such prescription\nArticle 62(1)(f) creates a lawful, transparent and fair mechanism for\nan election candidate to contest an allegation that he is disqualified\nunder one or more of the grounds listed in the said Constitutional\n\nprovision. Accordingly, in the case reported as Sardar Yar\n\nC.R.P.No.218 of 2013 in C.P.No.1033 of 2013 :6:\n\nMuhammad Rind Vs. Election Tribunal Balochistan, Quetta and\n\nothers (PLD 2020 SC 137) this Court held that a judicial declaration\ndisqualifying a candidate under Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution\nmust necessarily be based on oral or documentary evidence. In the\n\ncase reported as Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi Vs. Mian Muhammad\n\nNawaz Sharif (PLD 2017 SC 265), the learned Judge speaking for the\nmajority elaborated that even an Election Tribunal can only\ndisqualify a candidate when its declaration is issued on the basis of\nevidence before it. Such a requirement is implicit in Article 10A of the\nConstitution which makes both due process and fair trial a\nfundamental right in lawful judicial proceedings. Thus the\ndetermination of a dispute relating to a right or liability, the recording\nof evidence including the right of cross-examination, a hearing of the\narguments of the parties and a reasoned judgment are essential\n\nattributes of a court of law (ref: Tariq Transport Co., Lahore Vs.\n\nSargodha Bhera Bus Service (PLD 1958 SC (Pak) 437) and Mollah\n\nEjahar Ali vs Government of East Pakistan (PLD 1970 SC 173).\n\n6. It is evident that the summary finding given by the\nReturning Officer against the review petitioner in the year 2007 did\nnot comply with the requirement laid out in Article 62(1)(f) of the\nConstitution as amended in the year 2010, namely a declaration by a\ncourt of law. This is because a Returning Officer does not record\nevidence in his proceedings which are summary in nature. His\nfinding, unless set aside, is therefore valid only for the corresponding\nelection. In these circumstances, the doctrine of res judicata would\nalso be inapplicable to the finding of the Returning Officer because\nalthough the said finding remained unchallenged, the same was\ngiven without the recording of evidence including the right of cross-\n\nexamination. His finding thus lacked the attributes of a declaration\n\nC.R.P.No.218 of 2013 in C.P.No.1033 of 2013 7c\n\ngiven by a court of law. (ref: Roshan Ali Buriro Vs. Syed Murad Ali\n\nShah (2019 SCMR 1939). Both these conditions: one that evidence is\nrecorded before a court of law and two, that a finding given by such\ncourt is based on the evidence on record, are essential for a finding\nwith binding effect to be governed by res judicata (ref: Section 11 of\n\nthe Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and Muhammad Saleem Ullah Vs.\n\nAdditional District Judge, Gujranwala (PLD 2005 SC 511).\n\n7. According to settled law, the amended provision of Article\n62(1)(f) is effective prospectively from the date of its enforcement. This\nprovision governs all disqualification claims that arise after its\npromulgation in the year 2010. In the present case, disqualification\nof the petitioner was sought in the general election held in 2013 when\na declaration by a court of law was necessary to attract the\nConstitutional disqualification. On the other hand, the finding given\nby the Returning Officer in the present case was rendered in 2007\nprior to the amendment in Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution. Such a\nfinding was not a verdict given after a trial by a court of law; namely,\nfor the purposes of this case, an Election Tribunal or a Court of\nplenary jurisdiction. Since the forum of the Returning Officer lacks\nthe attributes of a court of law therefore the electoral disqualification\nimposed on the review petitioner under Article 62(1)(f) of the\nConstitution ceased to be effective after the 18t* Amendment. The\nsaid impact of the 18tt Amendment went unnoticed in our judgment\nunder review dated 09.07.2013 thereby constituting an error\n\napparent on the fact of the record.\n\n8. Having said that, a finding of dishonesty remains an\nignoble impediment against the election of the petitioner. Therefore, it\nmust be overcome by the petitioner if at any stage in the future he\nwishes to contest elections. An allegation of dishonesty based on the\n\ncertificate of Shah Abdul Latif University, Khairpur rather than the\n\nC.R.P.No.218 of 2013 in C.P.No.1033 of 2013 :8:\n\nfinding of the Returning Officer dated 03.12.2007, may still be\ninvoked against the petitioner. This would involve the allegation that\nthe petitioner committed forgery in the year 2007 by falsely claiming\nhis educational qualification to be equivalent to a graduation degree.\nAs this allegation remains unchallenged and unrebutted by the\npetitioner till date, any aggrieved party can in future object before the\ncompetent forum that dishonesty of the petitioner is apparent from\nthe University’s finding to the effect that he relied on a fake\n\nequivalence certificate for his sanad issued by a madrassa.\n\n9. In view of the foregoing, this review petition is allowed\nand the observation that the petitioner is disqualified under Article\n62(1)(f) of the Constitution in the circumstances of the case is\n\nrecalled.\n\nJUDGE\n\nJUDGE\n\nJUDGE\nIslamabad, the\n4th of February, 2020\n\nApproved for reporting\nWagas Naseer/Meher LC", "CleanedText": "ORDER UMAR ATA BANDIAL, J.- The question in issue is whether a finding dated 03.12.2007 given by the Returning Officer against the petitioner in summary proceedings held for scrutiny of nomination papers during general elections is final and binding for the purpose of permanently disqualifying the petitioner from contesting any general election under Article 62 1 f of the Constitution. The said finding concludes that the equivalence certificate issued by Shah Abdul Latif University, Khairpur about the petitioner s claimed sanad was fake thereby disqualifying the petitioner from contesting the election from PS-12 Shikarpur-II in 2008. As a result, the petitioner stepped out of the elections and did C.R.P.No.218 of 2013 in C.P.No.1033 of 2013 2:- not challenge the finding by the Returning Officer. In 2007 Article 62 1 f of the Constitution read as follows: 62. A person shall not be qualified to be elected or chosen as a member of Majlis-eShoora Parliament unless 0 he is sagacious, righteous and nonprofligate and honest and ameen However, the 18tt Amendment to the Constitution amended Article 62 1 f in the year 2010 to incorporate a condition that only a declaration, inter alia, of dishonesty given by a court of law could disqualify a candidate from contesting elections to the Parliament or a Provincial Assembly. The amended Constitutional provision reads as under: 62. 1 A person shall not be qualified to be elected or chosen as a member of Majlis-eShoora Parliament unless 0 he is sagacious, righteous and nonprofligate, honest and ameen, there being no declaration to the contrary by a court of law 2. The petitioner got elected as a member of the Sindh Provincial Assembly in the year 2013. However, on a complaint filed against him, the Election Commission of Pakistan ECP in exercise of its powers under Section 103-AA of the Representation of People Act, 1976 ROPA declared vide order dated 11.06.2013 that the petitioner was disqualified, inter alia, under Article 62 1 f of the Constitution to contest in the general election of 2013. The decision was based on the aforementioned finding recorded against the C.R.P.No.218 of 2013 in C.P.No.1033 of 2013 :3: petitioner by the Returning Officer on 03.12.2007 which had ousted him from the corresponding general election held in 2008. The petitioner s challenge to the said finding was ultimately rejected by this Court which upheld the order of the ECP vide judgment dated 09.07.2013 reported as Allah Dino Khan Bhayo Vs. Election Commission of Pakistan, Islamabad and others 2013 SCMR 1655 . 3. In this review against our judgment dated 09.07.2013, the question for our consideration is whether the finding by the Returning Officer given during scrutiny of nomination papers qualifies as a declaration given by a court of law within the terms of Article 62 1 f of the Constitution. This is important because by the year 2013 a few judgments by the Supreme Court including Malik Iqbal Ahmad Langrial Vs. Jamshed Alam PLD 2013 SC 179 and Abdul Ghafoor Lehri Vs. Returning Officer, PB-29 2013 SCMR 1271 had interpreted and held the unamended terms of Article 62 1 f to permanently disqualify a non-compliant candidate. 4. Both sides have relied upon the judgment delivered by a larger bench of this Court reported as Sami Ullah Baloch and others Vs. Abdul Karim Noursherwani and others PLD 2018 SC 405 to advance their rival pleas with respect to the review of our judgment dated 09.07.2013. Learned counsel for the petitioner has referred the said authority to assert that the petitioner s disqualification under Article 62 1 f of the Constitution cannot be permanent unless his disability under the said Article is declared by a court of law. Conversely, the respondents claim that our above mentioned judgment in the Sami Ullah Baloch case has approved our judgment dated 09.07.2013 that is now under review before us. The C.R.P.No.218 of 2013 in C.P.No.1033 of 2013 :4: endorsement by the larger Bench has fortified the view expressed in the judgment under review. In Sami Ullah Baloch s case this Court affirmed the rule that Article 62 1 f of the Constitution creates a permanent bar against contesting the general election. However, the impact of the change made by the 18 Amendment in Article 62 1 f of the Constitution and its legal effect was noted in paragraph 23 of the said judgment. This is reproduced as below: 23. ...In the present context, the conditions and qualifications in Article 62 1 f of the Constitution were retained in toto; and made objectively and transparently enforceable by the prescription of a judicial declaration for precipitating the loss of the electoral qualification specified in the said clause. Where a declaration made by a Court of law against a candidate for election warrants a conclusion of his misrepresentation, dishonesty, breach of trust, fraud, cheating, lack of fiduciary duty, conflict of interest, deception, dishonest misappropriation, etc. to be derived from such a verdict, then it stands to reason that the consequential incapacity imposed upon the candidate for election should last for as long as the declaration is in force. emphasis added The foregoing view with respect to a judicial declaration is elaborated in paragraph 35 of the judgment which holds that: 35. It is clear from the findings recorded in the afore-noted four judgments by this Court that the absence of a time limit for the ineligibility of a candidate for election in Article 62 1 f of the Constitution is the basis for holding his incapacity to be incurable by efflux of time. The reasons recorded in our judgment reinforce that conclusion. It may also be noted C.R.P.No.218 of 2013 in C.P.No.1033 of 2013 5: that the Constitution envisages other situations in which a permanent bar to the eligibility of a candidate for election is enforced so long as the judgment that records or justifies the disability of the candidate remains in existence and occupies the field. This view is supported by Articles 63 1 a and 63 1 b of the Constitution that provide disqualifications on account of judicial declaration regarding the mental unfitness or the undischarged insolvency of a candidate for election. These disabilities also continue so long as the adverse judgment is in the field. Finally, it may be noted that the prescription by the 18th Constitutional Amendment of an adverse judicial declaration to precipitate the ineligibility of a candidate for election has provided a lawful, transparent and fair mechanism to a candidate under challenge both for contesting and for avoiding the onset of an embargo on his eligibility to contest elections. The restriction imposed by Article 62 1 f of the Constitution for the eligibility of a candidate for election to Parliament serves the public need and public interest for honest, upright, truthful, trustworthy and prudent elected representatives. The judicial mechanism in Article 62 1 f of the Constitution grants a fair opportunity and adequate remedy for relief to a candidate under challenge to vindicate himself. emphasis added 5. The upshot of the said judgment is that a disqualification under Article 62 1 f of the Constitution can only be imposed by or under a declaration made by a court of law. By such prescription Article 62 1 f creates a lawful, transparent and fair mechanism for an election candidate to contest an allegation that he is disqualified under one or more of the grounds listed in the said Constitutional provision. Accordingly, in the case reported as Sardar Yar C.R.P.No.218 of 2013 in C.P.No.1033 of 2013 :6: Muhammad Rind Vs. Election Tribunal Balochistan, Quetta and others PLD 2020 SC 137 this Court held that a judicial declaration disqualifying a candidate under Article 62 1 f of the Constitution must necessarily be based on oral or documentary evidence. In the case reported as Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi Vs. Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif PLD 2017 SC 265 , the learned Judge speaking for the majority elaborated that even an Election Tribunal can only disqualify a candidate when its declaration is issued on the basis of evidence before it. Such a requirement is implicit in Article 10A of the Constitution which makes both due process and fair trial a fundamental right in lawful judicial proceedings. Thus the determination of a dispute relating to a right or liability, the recording of evidence including the right of cross-examination, a hearing of the arguments of the parties and a reasoned judgment are essential attributes of a court of law ref: Tariq Transport Co., Lahore Vs. Sargodha Bhera Bus Service PLD 1958 SC Pak 437 and Mollah Ejahar Ali vs Government of East Pakistan PLD 1970 SC 173 . 6. It is evident that the summary finding given by the Returning Officer against the review petitioner in the year 2007 did not comply with the requirement laid out in Article 62 1 f of the Constitution as amended in the year 2010, namely a declaration by a court of law. This is because a Returning Officer does not record evidence in his proceedings which are summary in nature. His finding, unless set aside, is therefore valid only for the corresponding election. In these circumstances, the doctrine of res judicata would also be inapplicable to the finding of the Returning Officer because although the said finding remained unchallenged, the same was given without the recording of evidence including the right of crossexamination. His finding thus lacked the attributes of a declaration C.R.P.No.218 of 2013 in C.P.No.1033 of 2013 7c given by a court of law. ref: Roshan Ali Buriro Vs. Syed Murad Ali Shah 2019 SCMR 1939 . Both these conditions: one that evidence is recorded before a court of law and two, that a finding given by such court is based on the evidence on record, are essential for a finding with binding effect to be governed by res judicata ref: Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and Muhammad Saleem Ullah Vs. Additional District Judge, Gujranwala PLD 2005 SC 511 . 7. According to settled law, the amended provision of Article 62 1 f is effective prospectively from the date of its enforcement. This provision governs all disqualification claims that arise after its promulgation in the year 2010. In the present case, disqualification of the petitioner was sought in the general election held in 2013 when a declaration by a court of law was necessary to attract the Constitutional disqualification. On the other hand, the finding given by the Returning Officer in the present case was rendered in 2007 prior to the amendment in Article 62 1 f of the Constitution. Such a finding was not a verdict given after a trial by a court of law; namely, for the purposes of this case, an Election Tribunal or a Court of plenary jurisdiction. Since the forum of the Returning Officer lacks the attributes of a court of law therefore the electoral disqualification imposed on the review petitioner under Article 62 1 f of the Constitution ceased to be effective after the 18t Amendment. The said impact of the 18tt Amendment went unnoticed in our judgment under review dated 09.07.2013 thereby constituting an error apparent on the fact of the record. 8. Having said that, a finding of dishonesty remains an ignoble impediment against the election of the petitioner. Therefore, it must be overcome by the petitioner if at any stage in the future he wishes to contest elections. An allegation of dishonesty based on the certificate of Shah Abdul Latif University, Khairpur rather than the C.R.P.No.218 of 2013 in C.P.No.1033 of 2013 :8: finding of the Returning Officer dated 03.12.2007, may still be invoked against the petitioner. This would involve the allegation that the petitioner committed forgery in the year 2007 by falsely claiming his educational qualification to be equivalent to a graduation degree. As this allegation remains unchallenged and unrebutted by the petitioner till date, any aggrieved party can in future object before the competent forum that dishonesty of the petitioner is apparent from the University s finding to the effect that he relied on a fake equivalence certificate for his sanad issued by a madrassa. 9. In view of the foregoing, this review petition is allowed and the observation that the petitioner is disqualified under Article 62 1 f of the Constitution in the circumstances of the case is recalled.

The impugned judgment\nof the learned High Court dated 06.12.2012 has reproduced\nthe ia questions that were subject to determination in\nIncome Tax References No.517 and 518/2010 pending before\nit. Speaking generally, these questions require determination\nof the circumstances when bad debts may be written off by an\nassessee. The first Tax Reference concerns the assessment\nyear 2001-02 which pertains to the income year ending\n\n31.12.2000. The relevant statutory provision regarding debt\n\nene EE EE SEE SEE SEES SEP EEE EEE SSE ae aa\n= ACORN\n\n\nC.As.573-574 2013, ' 2\n\nwrite off in that assessment year is section 23(1)(x) of the\nIncome Tax Ordinance, 1979 (“repealed Ordinance”). The\nsecond Tax Reference pertains to the tax year 2003 which\ncovers the income year ending 31.12.2002 and involves the\ninterpretation of section 29 of the Income Tax Ordinance,\n2001 (“Ordinance”), In these matters, the view of the learned\nAppellate Tribunal was affirmed by the impugned judgment of\nthe learned High Court which held that the bad debts claimed j\n\nby the respondent-bank fell within the ambit of the afore-\n\nnoted sections of the two Ordinances to qualify for their write\n\noff. ;\n\n2. Learned counsel for the appellant has made two\nsubmissions. First, that the bad debts claimed by the\n\nrespondent-bank do not satisfy the test of reasonableness\n\nthat governs the discretion of the Taxing Officer on whether to\nallow the concession of a write off to an assessee. In this\nbehalf, section 29 of the Ordinance controls the discretion of\nthe Taxing Officer to allow a write off of a claimed bad debt\nwhen there are reasonable grounds for believing that such\n\nclaimed debt is irrecoverable.\n\n3. In the present case, the CIT (Appeals) had vide his\n\norder dated 08.11.2005 affirmed the order of the Taxing\nOfficer dated 30.06.2005 to hold that inadequate securities\nwere obtained by the respondent-bank from its two customers\nin the tax year 2001-02. That the bank had also failed to\n\nsecure the personal guarantees of the controllers of these\n\n{2 TSE ROSS 7 SEAT NTA AOS TE NETTIE SNA ARR\n\nC.As,573-574 2013, 3\n\nborrower entities. Therefore the bank’s claim for write off the |\n\nalleged bad debts was denied. The second ground taken by\nthe learned counsel for the appellant is that the impugned\njudgment had improperly held the assessee (respondent-\nbank) to be “the best judge to determine as to what part of its\nbad debts required writing off and the assessee cannot write\noff debts only to save taxes, as in this case, he loses more\nthan he appeared to gain, whereas, the bad debts, if\n_recovered subsequently can be added in the income of\nassessee.” It is claimed that the above formulation construes\nthe rule contained in the aforenoted provisions of the two\nOrdinances very widely. Rather than requiring the assessee to\nsatisfy the test of reasonableness to demonstrate that the\nclaimed bad debts are actually irrecoverable, undue\ndiscretion has been vested in the assessee to select the debt\n\nthat should be written off.\n\n4. Learned counsel for the respondent has explained\nthe factual position by referring to the order of the CIT |\n(Appeals). It is noted that the respondent-bank paid full\namount of Income Tax chargeable on its total recoverable debt\nof Rs.62.006 million when it provisioned for the said amount\nduring the assessment year 1995-96. As such no revenue loss\nto the appellant is.caused if a part of the said outstanding i\ndebt is written off. Secondly, he submits that decrees were\nobtained against the borrowers owing the said debt and\n\nexecution proceedings were launched after such decrees\n\n'\n\nSSS SSRN NR ET TATA LA EE CAEL TN TTT\n\nwey S iit ‘ C.As.573-574 2013. 4\n\nbecame final. During execution proceedings the judgment\ndebtors settled with the peidon deat bank by making a\npayment of Rs.33 million. As a result, the respondent bank\nsought wbite off in respect of the balance of Rs.29 million\napproximately in the assessment year 2001-02.\n\nBe We note that the legal proceedings were instituted\n\nby the respondent-bank against the defaulting borrower\nwhich culminated in a decree that attained finality. Thereafter\n| execution proceedings on such decree were launched. As the\ncollateral taken for the loan had been dissipated or the\nborrower had been arrested, therefore, in such\ncircumstances, the recovery of the full amount of loan became\ndoubtful and a settlement was reached. This matter is\nessentially concerned with a factual determination about the\nneed for and bona fides of the settlement. On this aspect, the\nview taken by the learned Appellate Tribunal is the final\nopinion under the law. Be that as it may, in order to satisfy\nourselves, we have examined the relevant record. The\nreasonableness of the determination made by the learned\nTribunal is evident from execution proceedings on judicial\n\ndecrees launched against the defaulting debtors, recovery\n\neffected through settlements and the nil revenue implication\ndue to full tax payment for provisioning the daimed amount\nof bad debts.\n\n6. What remains to be considered is the other\nquestion whether the High Court has stated too broadly\nthe test by which debts claimed by an assessee may\n\nTeasonably be believed as irrecoverable and therefore be\n\ni\n\nre SEN EEE SEE GCE F TUNA EEA PETRI\n1 SECS EEE EEE zoe\n\nC.As.573-574 2013. , 5.\n\nclassified as bad debts. It is not a matter of discretion for the\nassessee to decide what a bad debt ie rather the assessee has\nto establish reasonable grounds showing that having taken\nthe requisite lawful steps for recovery of the outstanding\ndebts, the same are not recoverable in the foreseeable future.\nIt goes without saying that if in a subsequent tax year\nrecovery of a bad debt is effected then the same is taxable as\nincome. Aectidingly, to our minds the test laid down in\n\nCommissioner of Income Tax versus National Bank of\n\nPakistan, Karachi (PLD 1976 Karachi 1025 at page 1028)\nthat “the question will always be of the estimate of the facts\nand circumstances of a case, and because human estimates\nare necessarily fallible, the respondent’s claim and/or its\nbooks of account cannot be rejected, merely because it\nmaintains dvaysiaea of accounts, which permits it, in the\nevent of windfall from the debtor, so to say, to reverse the\nearlier entries writing off a debt as irrecoverable”, gives an\naccurate approach on how the relevant provision, namely,\nsection 29 of the Ordinance, is liable to be construed. Learned\ncounsel for the appellant has referred to the judgment of the\n\nlearned High Court in Commissioner of Income Tax (Legal),\n\nIslamabad versus Askari Commercial Bank Limited,\n\nRawalpindi (2018 PID 1089) which considers the effect of\nsection 100A and the Seventh Schedule to the Ordinance.\nThese were incorporated into the said Ordinance in the year\n2007. The following observations were made in relation to the\npresent context: :\n\n“The legislature, through the Finance Act, 2007,\n\nmanifested its intent, inter alia, in relation to the\n\nTLRS TAA\n\n\nC.As.573-574 2013. 6\n\ntreatment regarding non performing loans by\ninserting section 100A and the rules specified in the\n\nSeventh Schedule. It expressly acknowledges and\n\nrefers to the Prudential Regulations issued by the\nState Bank of Pakistan in relation to a Banking\nCompany for computing income under the\n| Ordinance of 2001. These special provisions\n| exclusively deal with banking business and,\ntherefore, have to be interpreted harmoniously with\nsection 29 in the context of bad debts. ... At this\nstage the distinction between a non performing loan\n\nand written off debt needs to be probed. This would\n\nalso answer the question as to when a loan becomes\na bad debt and thus irrecoverable. This distinction is\ncrucial because the expression non performing loan\nwas not mentioned under the repealed Ordinance of\n1979 nor under the Ordinance of 2001 before the\n\ninsertion of the rules under the Seventh Schedule.”\n\nT. the facts of the present case pertain to\nassessment ea 2001-02 and tax year 2003 which occurred\nprior to the year 2007 when the amendments in the\nOrdinance were made. Therefore the concept of non-\nperforming loan is not quite relevant to the instant case. Be\n“that as it may, the test of reasonableness for justifying\nirrecoverability of a debt laid down in section 29 of the\nOrdinance is nevertheless applicable. Therefore, the\nclassification of a bad debt is not left to the discretion of the\n\ntaxpayer. It must be demonstrated by the securities and the\n\nbona fide measures taken by the taxpayer to secure\nrepayment of the outstanding debt. To our minds that factual\n\ntest has been applied and held to be satisfied by the two\n\nSLT AANA AN TN NANT HUT GUTTA\n\nAERIS, AN TST ET TTS\n\n\nff C.As,573-574 2013.\n\nlearned fora below.

Therefore the bank s claim for write off the alleged bad debts was denied. The second ground taken by the learned counsel for the appellant is that the impugned judgment had improperly held the assessee respondentbank to be the best judge to determine as to what part of its bad debts required writing off and the assessee cannot write off debts only to save taxes, as in this case, he loses more than he appeared to gain, whereas, the bad debts, if recovered subsequently can be added in the income of assessee.

It is noted that the respondent-bank paid full amount of Income Tax chargeable on its total recoverable debt of Rs.62.006 million when it provisioned for the said amount during the assessment year 1995-96. As such no revenue loss to the appellant is.caused if a part of the said outstanding i debt is written off. Secondly, he submits that decrees were obtained against the borrowers owing the said debt and execution proceedings were launched after such decrees SSS SSRN NR ET TATA LA EE CAEL TN TTT wey S iit C.As.573-574 2013. 4 became final. During execution proceedings the judgment debtors settled with the peidon deat bank by making a payment of Rs.33 million. As a result, the respondent bank sought wbite off in respect of the balance of Rs.29 million approximately in the assessment year 2001-02. Be We note that the legal proceedings were instituted by the respondent-bank against the defaulting borrower which culminated in a decree that attained finality. Thereafter execution proceedings on such decree were launched. As the collateral taken for the loan had been dissipated or the borrower had been arrested, therefore, in such circumstances, the recovery of the full amount of loan became doubtful and a settlement was reached. This matter is essentially concerned with a factual determination about the need for and bona fides of the settlement. On this aspect, the view taken by the learned Appellate Tribunal is the final opinion under the law. Be that as it may, in order to satisfy ourselves, we have examined the relevant record. The reasonableness of the determination made by the learned Tribunal is evident from execution proceedings on judicial decrees launched against the defaulting debtors, recovery effected through settlements and the nil revenue implication due to full tax payment for provisioning the daimed amount of bad debts. 6.

It is not a matter of discretion for the assessee to decide what a bad debt ie rather the assessee has to establish reasonable grounds showing that having taken the requisite lawful steps for recovery of the outstanding debts, the same are not recoverable in the foreseeable future. It goes without saying that if in a subsequent tax year recovery of a bad debt is effected then the same is taxable as income. Aectidingly, to our minds the test laid down in Commissioner of Income Tax versus National Bank of Pakistan, Karachi PLD 1976 Karachi 1025 at that the question will always be of the estimate of the facts and circumstances of a case, and because human estimates are necessarily fallible, the respondent s claim and/or its books of account cannot be rejected, merely because it maintains dvaysiaea of accounts, which permits it, in the event of windfall from the debtor, so to say, to reverse the earlier entries writing off a debt as irrecoverable , gives an accurate approach on how the relevant provision, namely, section 29 of the Ordinance, is liable to be construed. Learned counsel for the appellant has referred to the judgment of the learned High Court in Commissioner of Income Tax Legal , Islamabad versus Askari Commercial Bank Limited, Rawalpindi 2018 PID 1089 which considers the effect of section 100A and the Seventh Schedule to the Ordinance. These were incorporated into the said Ordinance in the year 2007. The following observations were made in relation to the present context: : The legislature, through the Finance Act, 2007, manifested its intent, inter alia, in relation to the TLRS TAA C.As.573-574 2013. 6 treatment regarding non performing loans by inserting section 100A and the rules specified in the Seventh Schedule. It expressly acknowledges and refers to the Prudential Regulations issued by the State Bank of Pakistan in relation to a Banking Company for computing income under the Ordinance of 2001. These special provisions exclusively deal with banking business and, therefore, have to be interpreted harmoniously with section 29 in the context of bad debts. ... At this stage the distinction between a non performing loan and written off debt needs to be probed. This would also answer the question as to when a loan becomes a bad debt and thus irrecoverable. This distinction is crucial because the expression non performing loan was not mentioned under the repealed Ordinance of 1979 nor under the Ordinance of 2001 before the insertion of the rules under the Seventh Schedule. T. the facts of the present case pertain to assessment ea 2001-02 and tax year 2003 which occurred prior to the year 2007 when the amendments in the Ordinance were made. Therefore the concept of nonperforming loan is not quite relevant to the instant case. Be that as it may, the test of reasonableness for justifying irrecoverability of a debt laid down in section 29 of the Ordinance is nevertheless applicable. Therefore, the classification of a bad debt is not left to the discretion of the taxpayer. It must be demonstrated by the securities and the bona fide measures taken by the taxpayer to secure repayment of the outstanding debt.

During the course of tax year 2011, the\n\nrespondent paid advance income tax at the import stage on the\n\nvalue of goods which tax in terms of Section 148 of the Income Tax\n\nOrdinance, 2001 (“2001 Ordinance”) had become its final tax\n\nliability for that tax year. During the same tax year, Section 4A was\n\nCIVIL APPEAL NO. 1460 OF 2013 AND 2\nCIVIL PETITION NO. 133 OF 2012\n\ninserted in the 2001 Ordinance through the Income Tax\n(Amendment) Ordinance, 2011 dated 16.03.2011 whereby\nsurcharge was imposed at the rate of 15% of the income tax\npayable under the 2001 Ordinance for the period commencing\nfrom the promulgation of the 2001 Ordinance till 30.06.2011.\nSection 4A of the 2001 Ordinance reads:\n\n‘4A, Surcharge: - (1) Subject to this Ordinance, a surcharge\nshall be payable by every taxpayer at the rate of fifteen per\ncent of the income tax payable under this Ordinance including\nthe tax payable under Part V of Chapter X of Chapter XIII, as\nthe case may be, for the period commencing from the\npromulgation of this Ordinance, till the 30‘ June, 2011.\n\n(2) Surcharge shall be paid, collected, deducted and deposited\nat the same time and in the same manner as the tax is paid,\ncollected, deducted and deposited under this Ordinance\nincluding Chapter X or XII as the case may be:\n\nProvided that this surcharge shall not be payable for the tax\n\nyear 2010 and prior tax years and shall be applicable, subject\n\nto the provisions of sub-section (1), for the tax year 2011 only.’\n2. On 12.09.2011, FBR issued Circular No.11 of 2011,\nrelevant portion of which reads ‘However, it has been decided that\nthe tax liability for the entire T/Y (Tax Year) 2011 may not be\nsubjected to imposition of surcharge and the same be levied on the\nproportionate liability for a period of three and a half months.’ Thus,\nin terms of the Circular, the liability of surcharge was confined to a\nperiod of 3% months (16.03.2011 to 30.06.2011) and the tax\nliability of the tax year 2011 was to be proportionately allocated to\nthe 3% month period. This Circular was then followed by the\nFederal Government’s Notification SRO 977 (1) 2011 dated\n19.10.2011 whereby in exercise of the power conferred by Sub-\nSection (2) of Section 53 of the 2001 Ordinance, Clause (11) was\nadded in Part III of the Second Schedule which reads ‘The amount\nof surcharge payable on the income tax liability for the tax year\n2011 under Section 4A shall be computed on the proportionate\n\namount of income tax liability for three and a half months.’\n\n3. Before the period for the filing of tax returns under\nSection 114 and the statement of income under Section 115 of the\n\n2001 Ordinance for the tax year 2011 expired, the respondent\n\nCIVIL APPEAL NO. 1460 OF 2013 AND 3\nCIVIL PETITION NO. 133 OF 2012\n\nchallenged FBR’s Circular dated 12.09.2011 in the High Court of\nSindh in its Constitutional jurisdiction. The main ground for the\nchallenge was that the surcharge can only be computed on that tax\nliability that exclusively pertained to the income derived in the 3%\nmonths period. It was thus maintained by the respondent that for\nthe purpose of computing surcharge, all payments of advance\nincome tax made at the import stage in the entire tax year 2011\nshould not be taken into consideration proportionately for the\npurposes of determining surcharge for the 3’ month period and\nthe advance income tax paid in the said 3% month period only\ncould have been considered. On such basis, prayer was made to\n\ndeclare FBR’s Circular unlawful and void ab initio.\n\n4. The learned judges of the High Court in the impugned\njudgment gave the findings to the effect that Section 4A of the\n2001 Ordinance does not envisage proportionate determination of\nthe tax liability of the entire tax year 2011 for the purposes of\ncalculating surcharge for the 3% month period and only that\nincome was to be taken into consideration which pertained to such\nperiod only. In other words, taxable income for 3% month period\nfalling between 16.03.2011 to 30.06.2011 alone was to be\nascertained on which tax liability was to be worked out afresh and\nthen on such tax liability surcharge was to be computed. The effect\nof the impugned judgement was that it split the entire tax year\n2011 into two and then the income of the last 3% month period\nonly was taken into consideration for computing tax liability and\non that limited tax liability of 3 “2 month period the surcharge was\nto be computed. In deciding so, the High Court invoked the\nprinciple that when two interpretations of a charging provision are\nreasonably possible, the one favouring the taxpayer is to be\npreferred and adopted. This principle was applied after taking into\nconsideration the fact that most of the respondent’s taxable income\nrelated to the first 8’ month period of tax year 2011 and not the\nremaining period of 3% month and the interpretation which it put\non Section 4A of the 2001 Ordinance was more beneficial to the\nrespondent’s case. Upon giving such findings, FBR’s Circular dated\n\n12.09.2011 was declared to be inconsistent with the provisions of\n\nCIVIL APPEAL NO. 1460 OF 2013 AND 4\nCIVIL PETITION NO. 133 OF 2012\n\nSection 4A of the 2001 Ordinance. Aggrieved by such decision, the\ndepartment has preferred this appeal with the leave of this Court.\n\n5. The whole of the 2001 Ordinance envisages that the\nincome tax liability is to be determined on the basis of taxable\nincome that is derived or legally presumed to have been derived in\na whole tax year and not any part of it. Therefore, even for the\npurpose of computing surcharge under Section 4A of the\nOrdinance, the entire income tax liability of the tax year 2011 was\nto be taken into consideration which was then to be\nproportionately allocated to the 3’% month period and on that\nfigure of proportionate tax liability surcharge was to be calculated.\nThis is so as no provision of the 2001 Ordinance allows splitting of\na tax year into two periods for the purposes of determining two\nseparate taxable incomes of the same tax year and then on the\nincome of one such period tax liability is to be computed. If that is\ndone, it would be in derogation of the provisions of the 2001\nOrdinance itself, most relevant being the provisions of Sections\n4(1), 74, 114 and 115 of the 2001 Ordinance. When we read\nSection 4 (1) of the 2001 Ordinance, it clearly provides that income\ntax liability is to be determined for the entire period of a tax year\nnot any part of it and tax year is specifically defined in Section 74\nof the 2001 Ordinance which means a period of twelve months.\nThis period normally ends on 30th June and may also end on any\nother date in case the same is allowed by the competent authority\nto be adopted. Nevertheless, a tax year under Section 74 of the\n2001 Ordinance has to be of twelve months. It is for this reason\nthat Section 114 of the 2001 Ordinance under which return of\nincome is required to be filed covers entire tax year. Even in cases\nwhere payment of advance tax becomes a person’s final tax liability\nand he is required to file only a statement of income under Section\n115 of the 2001 Ordinance, that statement too has to be with\nregard to the tax year and not any part of it. Whatever method of\ncomputing taxable income is applicable to a person, either at the\nrates specified in the Schedule to the 2001 Ordinance or the\nadvance tax deductions become his final tax liability, one thing is\ncertain that income tax liability is determined on the actual or\n\npresumptive income of the whole tax year. Therefore, in cases\n\nCIVIL APPEAL NO. 1460 OF 2013 AND 5\nCIVIL PETITION NO. 133 OF 2012\n\nwhere advance tax deduction made on the basis of value of goods\nimported by a person is considered to be his final tax liability, the\nlegally presumed taxable income of such a person would be the\ntotal value of goods imported in a given tax year. Hence in\nwhichever mode the tax liability of a person is determined under\nthe 2001 Ordinance, it is determined on a taxable income that\npertains to a whole tax year. Splitting of taxable income of the\nsame tax year would negate the very intention of the Legislature\nreflected from the provisions of Sections 4(1), 74, 114 and 115 of\nthe 2001 Ordinance. Not only this, the provision of Section 4A (1)\nof the 2001 Ordinance also leads us to reach to the same\n\nconclusion. It reads as follows:-\n\n“4A. Surcharge: - (1) Subject to this Ordinance, a surcharge\nshall be payable by every taxpayer at the rate of fifteen per\ncent of the income tax payable under this Ordinance including\nthe tax payable under Part V of Chapter X of Chapter XIII, as\nthe case may be, for the period commencing from the\npromulgation of this Ordinance, till the 30th June, 2011.\n\n6. As is evident from the contents of Section 4A(1) of the\n2001 Ordinance, it starts with the phrase ‘Subject to this\nOrdinance’, underlined to lay emphasis, which clearly points out\nthat it does not have any overriding effect, hence, it cannot be in\nderogation of any provision of the 2001 Ordinance and, as already\ndiscussed, no provision of the 2001 Ordinance envisages splitting\nof a taxable income of a tax year. Secondly, Section 4A also\ncontains the phrase “‘... at the rate of fifteen percent of the income\ntax payable under this Ordinance...’ underlined to lay emphasis,\nwhich further leads us towards the direction that surcharge is to\nbe computed on the income tax that is determined in the manner\nprovided under the 2001 Ordinance itself and not in any other\nmanner. This leaves no room for computing tax liability of the tax\nyear 2011 on a basis other than what is provided in the 2001\nOrdinance. This then means that the whole basis for computing\nsurcharge even for 3% month period should be the income tax\nliability that is determined for the entire tax year, 2011 and then\nsuch tax liability is to be proportionately allocated for the 3%\nmonth period for the purposes of computing surcharge without\n\ndetermining two separate taxable incomes of the same tax year and\n\nCIVIL APPEAL NO. 1460 OF 2013 AND 6\nCIVIL PETITION NO. 133 OF 2012\n\nthen working out tax liability of 3% months separately for the\npurposes of computing surcharge. In other words, there cannot be\nseparate determination of taxable income for 8% month period\n(from 1st July to 15t® March) for which accounting is to be\nseparately done and then a separate accounting is done for the\nremaining 3% month period (from 16‘ March to 30% June) and on\nthe basis of taxable income emerging for the 3% month period,\nincome tax liability is computed and on that surcharge payable\n\nSection 4A of the 2001 Ordinance is calculated.\n\n7. As discussed above, when no provision of the 2001\nOrdinance permit splitting of tax year for the purposes of\ndetermining two separate taxable incomes of the same tax year and\nthe only way to compute surcharge was to allocate tax liability of\nthe entire tax year 2011 proportionately to the 3% month period\nthen the question of more than one interpretation of Section 4A\ndoes not arise. Even for argument sake we assume that more than\ntwo interpretation of Section 4A were possible then how to deal\nwith the situation where there are two sets of taxpayers, one to\nwhom the proportionate basis would be more suitable as they may\nhave derived all or substantial income in the last 3% month period\nof the tax year 2011 in comparison to first 8’ month period of the\ntax year 2011. For them the interpretation of the learned judges of\nHigh Court which splits the tax year into two would not be of any\nbenefit as proportionate determination of taxable liability would be\nmore suitable to them. Whereas the other set of taxpayers like the\nrespondent to whom the splitting of the tax year for the purposes\nof determination of taxable income and on that tax liability is\ncomputed separately would be more beneficial instead of\nproportionate allocation of tax liability. Both the situations can\narise. This would mean to vary the interpretation in order to give\nbeneficial interpretation. The Courts cannot put two separate\ninterpretations of the same provision of law on the principle of\nbeneficial interpretation, one of which is beneficial to one set of\ntaxpayers and the other to another, though the taxing provision\napplies equally to both the sets of taxpayers without any\ndistinction whatsoever. This would create an anomalous situation.\n\nWe are clear in our minds that Section 4A does not admit more\n\nCIVIL APPEAL NO. 1460 OF 2013 AND 7\nCIVIL PETITION NO. 133 OF 2012\n\nthan one interpretation as it was inserted in the 2001 Ordinance\nwith the rider that it is subject to the other provisions of the said\nOrdinance and none of its provisions permit splitting of the period\na tax year for the purposes of determining one tax liability for one\nperiod and the other for the other period of the same tax year.\nTherefore, the only way Section 4A would have become workable\nfor the purposes of computing surcharge keeping within the four\ncorners of the Ordinance was that the tax liability of the entire tax\nyear 2011 was proportionately divided in order to notionally work\nout the tax liability for the 3% month period that falls between\n16.03.2011 and 30.06.2011 and then liability of surcharge is\n\ncomputed on such determination.\n\n8. The respondent follows normal tax year of twelve\nmonths that ends every year on 30t June. Whatever advance tax\nwas recovered from the respondent at the import stage during the\nentire tax year 2011 that had become his final tax liability for the\nentire tax year 2011. As income tax liability for the whole tax year\nhad already stood determined then this tax liability was to be\nproportionately divided in order to determine the notional tax\nliability of 3 % month period and on that surcharge under Section\n4A of the 2001 Ordinance was to be computed. For example,\nincome tax liability of the respondent for the entire tax year 2011\nis assumed to be Rs.120,000, the same was to be divided by 12\nand then multiplied by 3% which would have given proportionate\nincome tax liability for the 3% month period, which comes to\nRs.35,000/-. (Rs.120,000 + 12 x 3% = Rs.35,000). On this\nproportionate tax liability 15% surcharge payable under Section 4A\nof the 2001 Ordinance was to be calculated. The Circular in\nquestion had only explained the only possible way the surcharge\nunder Section 4A could be computed by remaining within the\n\nambit of the provisions of the 2001 Ordinance.\n\n9. We may also point out an important aspect of the case\nwhich had escaped the attention of the advocates of the parties as\nwell as the learned judges of the High Court. When we read Section\n4A (1) of the 2001 Ordinance, it states that surcharge was to be\n\ncalculated ‘....for the period commencing from the promulgation of\n\nCIVIL APPEAL NO. 1460 OF 2013 AND 8\nCIVIL PETITION NO. 133 OF 2012\n\nthis Ordinance, till the 30th June, 2011.’ This clearly means that\nSection 4A in its application came into effect right from the date of\nthe promulgation of the 2001 Ordinance i.e. the year 2001 till\n30.06.2011 which application was then restricted to only tax year\n2011 by its proviso which reads ‘Provided that this surcharge shall\nnot be payable for the tax year 2010 and prior tax years and shall\nbe applicable, subject to the provisions of sub-section (1), for the tax\nyear 2011 only.’ The proviso makes Section 4A effective for the tax\nyear 2011 only. By no means Section 4A is to be read to mean that\nit covers only a part of the tax year, 2011. Probably realizing the\nfact that Section 4A, in its application covers the entire tax year\n2011 though inserted in the 2001 Ordinance on 16.03.2011 i.e.\nduring the course of tax year 2011, FBR through its Circular No.11\nof 2011 announced that the surcharge was to be paid with effect\nfrom 16.03.2011 i.e. the day Section 4A was inserted in the 2001\nOrdinance till 30.06.2011 which was to be computed on the basis\nof proportionate tax liability of the tax year 2011. This Circular in\neffect granted concession to the taxpayers otherwise Section 4A\nhad covered the entire tax year 2011 and not any part of it.\nProbably realizing the fact that FBR through its circulars cannot\ngrant any concession, the same was followed by the Federal\nGovernment’s Notification SRO 977 (1) 2011 dated 19.10.2011\nwhich was issued in exercise of the power conferred on it under\nSub-Section (2) of Section 53 of the 2001 Ordinance whereby\nClause (11) was added in Part III of the Second Schedule. Clause\n(11) provided ‘The amount of surcharge payable on the income tax\nliability for the tax year 2011 under Section 4A shall be computed on\nthe proportionate amount of income tax liability for three and a half\nmonths.’ The said SRO which was issued by the Federal\nGovernment in exercise of powers contained in Section 53 of the\n2001 Ordinance and granted exemption in the sense that it limited\nthe application of Section 4A to only 3% month period, which in\nterms of Section 4A covered the entire tax year 2011 and while\nextending such exemption, provided the mode in which the\nsurcharge was to be computed i.e. on the basis of proportionate\ntax liability of the tax year 2011. Hence the said SRO 977 (1) 2011\ndated 19.10.2011 on its own strength had the force of law and\n\nCIVIL APPEAL NO. 1460 OF 2013 AND 9\nCIVIL PETITION NO. 133 OF 2012\n\nnever came under challenge. So has to be given effect to\nregardless of the FBR’s Circular dated 12.09.2011, which only was\nchallenge was challenged in the High Court.\n\n10. The above are the detailed reasons of our short order\ndated 09.03.2020 whereby the delay was condoned, this appeal\nwas allowed and the connected Civil Petition No. 133 of 2020 was\nconverted into appeal and allowed. The short order reads as\nfollows:-\n\n“We have heard the C.P. No. 133 of 2013 and have\narrived at the conclusion that the surcharge levied under\nSection 4A of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 added thereto\nby Income Tax (Amendment) Ordinance IV of 2011 levies a\nsurcharge on the income tax payable for the entire tax year.\nAccordingly, for reasons to be recorded later, this petition is\nconverted into appeal and allowed.\n\n2. In Civil Appeal No. 1460 of 2013 leave was granted\nby order dated 02.12.2013 but subject to the question of\nlimitation as the petition is admittedly barred by O9 days.\nAccording to the principle laid down in Mehreen Zaibun Nisa\netc. versus Land Commissioner, Multan _etc (PLD 1975 SC\n397) and Province of Punjab versus Muhammad _Tayyab\n(1989 SCMR 1621) when a common question of law is\ndecided in one case, another case involving the same point\nthat is time barred is liable to be heard on merits.\nConsequently, following the said principle, we condone the\ndelay and insofar as the merits are concerned, for reasons to\nbe recorded later, we allow this appeal.”\n\nJUDGE\n\nJUDGE\n\nJUDGE\nIslamabad, the\n9th of March, 2020\nApproved For Reporting", "CleanedText": "JUDGMENT CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1460/2013 FAISAL ARAB, J.- The respondent is a partnership firm engaged in the business of importing goods and selling them in the local markets. During the course of tax year 2011, the respondent paid advance income tax at the import stage on the value of goods which tax in terms of Section 148 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 2001 Ordinance had become its final tax liability for that tax year. During the same tax year, Section 4A was CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1460 OF 2013 AND 2 CIVIL PETITION NO. 133 OF 2012 inserted in the 2001 Ordinance through the Income Tax Amendment Ordinance, 2011 dated 16.03.2011 whereby surcharge was imposed at the rate of 15 of the income tax payable under the 2001 Ordinance for the period commencing from the promulgation of the 2001 Ordinance till 30.06.2011. Section 4A of the 2001 Ordinance reads: 4A, Surcharge: - 1 Subject to this Ordinance, a surcharge shall be payable by every taxpayer at the rate of fifteen per cent of the income tax payable under this Ordinance including the tax payable under Part V of Chapter X of Chapter XIII, as the case may be, for the period commencing from the promulgation of this Ordinance, till the 30 June, 2011. 2 Surcharge shall be paid, collected, deducted and deposited at the same time and in the same manner as the tax is paid, collected, deducted and deposited under this Ordinance including Chapter X or XII as the case may be: Provided that this surcharge shall not be payable for the tax year 2010 and prior tax years and shall be applicable, subject to the provisions of sub-section 1 , for the tax year 2011 only. 2. On 12.09.2011, FBR issued Circular No.11 of 2011, relevant portion of which reads However, it has been decided that the tax liability for the entire T/Y Tax Year 2011 may not be subjected to imposition of surcharge and the same be levied on the proportionate liability for a period of three and a half months. Thus, in terms of the Circular, the liability of surcharge was confined to a period of 3 months 16.03.2011 to 30.06.2011 and the tax liability of the tax year 2011 was to be proportionately allocated to the 3 month period. This Circular was then followed by the Federal Government s Notification SRO 977 1 2011 dated 19.10.2011 whereby in exercise of the power conferred by SubSection 2 of Section 53 of the 2001 Ordinance, Clause 11 was added in Part III of the Second Schedule which reads The amount of surcharge payable on the income tax liability for the tax year 2011 under Section 4A shall be computed on the proportionate amount of income tax liability for three and a half months. 3. Before the period for the filing of tax returns under Section 114 and the statement of income under Section 115 of the 2001 Ordinance for the tax year 2011 expired, the respondent CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1460 OF 2013 AND 3 CIVIL PETITION NO. 133 OF 2012 challenged FBR s Circular dated 12.09.2011 in the High Court of Sindh in its Constitutional jurisdiction. The main ground for the challenge was that the surcharge can only be computed on that tax liability that exclusively pertained to the income derived in the 3 months period. It was thus maintained by the respondent that for the purpose of computing surcharge, all payments of advance income tax made at the import stage in the entire tax year 2011 should not be taken into consideration proportionately for the purposes of determining surcharge for the 3 month period and the advance income tax paid in the said 3 month period only could have been considered. On such basis, prayer was made to declare FBR s Circular unlawful and void ab initio. 4. The learned judges of the High Court in the impugned judgment gave the findings to the effect that Section 4A of the 2001 Ordinance does not envisage proportionate determination of the tax liability of the entire tax year 2011 for the purposes of calculating surcharge for the 3 month period and only that income was to be taken into consideration which pertained to such period only. In other words, taxable income for 3 month period falling between 16.03.2011 to 30.06.2011 alone was to be ascertained on which tax liability was to be worked out afresh and then on such tax liability surcharge was to be computed. The effect of the impugned judgement was that it split the entire tax year 2011 into two and then the income of the last 3 month period only was taken into consideration for computing tax liability and on that limited tax liability of 3 2 month period the surcharge was to be computed. In deciding so, the High Court invoked the principle that when two interpretations of a charging provision are reasonably possible, the one favouring the taxpayer is to be preferred and adopted. This principle was applied after taking into consideration the fact that most of the respondent s taxable income related to the first 8 month period of tax year 2011 and not the remaining period of 3 month and the interpretation which it put on Section 4A of the 2001 Ordinance was more beneficial to the respondent s case. Upon giving such findings, FBR s Circular dated 12.09.2011 was declared to be inconsistent with the provisions of CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1460 OF 2013 AND 4 CIVIL PETITION NO. 133 OF 2012 Section 4A of the 2001 Ordinance. Aggrieved by such decision, the department has preferred this appeal with the leave of this Court. 5. The whole of the 2001 Ordinance envisages that the income tax liability is to be determined on the basis of taxable income that is derived or legally presumed to have been derived in a whole tax year and not any part of it. Therefore, even for the purpose of computing surcharge under Section 4A of the Ordinance, the entire income tax liability of the tax year 2011 was to be taken into consideration which was then to be proportionately allocated to the 3 month period and on that figure of proportionate tax liability surcharge was to be calculated. This is so as no provision of the 2001 Ordinance allows splitting of a tax year into two periods for the purposes of determining two separate taxable incomes of the same tax year and then on the income of one such period tax liability is to be computed. If that is done, it would be in derogation of the provisions of the 2001 Ordinance itself, most relevant being the provisions of Sections 4 1 , 74, 114 and 115 of the 2001 Ordinance. When we read Section 4 1 of the 2001 Ordinance, it clearly provides that income tax liability is to be determined for the entire period of a tax year not any part of it and tax year is specifically defined in Section 74 of the 2001 Ordinance which means a period of twelve months. This period normally ends on 30th June and may also end on any other date in case the same is allowed by the competent authority to be adopted. Nevertheless, a tax year under Section 74 of the 2001 Ordinance has to be of twelve months. It is for this reason that Section 114 of the 2001 Ordinance under which return of income is required to be filed covers entire tax year. Even in cases where payment of advance tax becomes a person s final tax liability and he is required to file only a statement of income under Section 115 of the 2001 Ordinance, that statement too has to be with regard to the tax year and not any part of it. Whatever method of computing taxable income is applicable to a person, either at the rates specified in the Schedule to the 2001 Ordinance or the advance tax deductions become his final tax liability, one thing is certain that income tax liability is determined on the actual or presumptive income of the whole tax year. Therefore, in cases CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1460 OF 2013 AND 5 CIVIL PETITION NO. 133 OF 2012 where advance tax deduction made on the basis of value of goods imported by a person is considered to be his final tax liability, the legally presumed taxable income of such a person would be the total value of goods imported in a given tax year. Hence in whichever mode the tax liability of a person is determined under the 2001 Ordinance, it is determined on a taxable income that pertains to a whole tax year. Splitting of taxable income of the same tax year would negate the very intention of the Legislature reflected from the provisions of Sections 4 1 , 74, 114 and 115 of the 2001 Ordinance. Not only this, the provision of Section 4A 1 of the 2001 Ordinance also leads us to reach to the same conclusion. It reads as follows:- 4A. Surcharge: - 1 Subject to this Ordinance, a surcharge shall be payable by every taxpayer at the rate of fifteen per cent of the income tax payable under this Ordinance including the tax payable under Part V of Chapter X of Chapter XIII, as the case may be, for the period commencing from the promulgation of this Ordinance, till the 30th June, 2011. 6. As is evident from the contents of Section 4A 1 of the 2001 Ordinance, it starts with the phrase Subject to this Ordinance , underlined to lay emphasis, which clearly points out that it does not have any overriding effect, hence, it cannot be in derogation of any provision of the 2001 Ordinance and, as already discussed, no provision of the 2001 Ordinance envisages splitting of a taxable income of a tax year. Secondly, Section 4A also contains the phrase ... at the rate of fifteen percent of the income tax payable under this Ordinance... underlined to lay emphasis, which further leads us towards the direction that surcharge is to be computed on the income tax that is determined in the manner provided under the 2001 Ordinance itself and not in any other manner. This leaves no room for computing tax liability of the tax year 2011 on a basis other than what is provided in the 2001 Ordinance. This then means that the whole basis for computing surcharge even for 3 month period should be the income tax liability that is determined for the entire tax year, 2011 and then such tax liability is to be proportionately allocated for the 3 month period for the purposes of computing surcharge without determining two separate taxable incomes of the same tax year and CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1460 OF 2013 AND 6 CIVIL PETITION NO. 133 OF 2012 then working out tax liability of 3 months separately for the purposes of computing surcharge. In other words, there cannot be separate determination of taxable income for 8 month period from 1st July to 15t March for which accounting is to be separately done and then a separate accounting is done for the remaining 3 month period from 16 March to 30 June and on the basis of taxable income emerging for the 3 month period, income tax liability is computed and on that surcharge payable Section 4A of the 2001 Ordinance is calculated. 7. As discussed above, when no provision of the 2001 Ordinance permit splitting of tax year for the purposes of determining two separate taxable incomes of the same tax year and the only way to compute surcharge was to allocate tax liability of the entire tax year 2011 proportionately to the 3 month period then the question of more than one interpretation of Section 4A does not arise. Even for argument sake we assume that more than two interpretation of Section 4A were possible then how to deal with the situation where there are two sets of taxpayers, one to whom the proportionate basis would be more suitable as they may have derived all or substantial income in the last 3 month period of the tax year 2011 in comparison to first 8 month period of the tax year 2011. For them the interpretation of the learned judges of High Court which splits the tax year into two would not be of any benefit as proportionate determination of taxable liability would be more suitable to them. Whereas the other set of taxpayers like the respondent to whom the splitting of the tax year for the purposes of determination of taxable income and on that tax liability is computed separately would be more beneficial instead of proportionate allocation of tax liability. Both the situations can arise. This would mean to vary the interpretation in order to give beneficial interpretation. The Courts cannot put two separate interpretations of the same provision of law on the principle of beneficial interpretation, one of which is beneficial to one set of taxpayers and the other to another, though the taxing provision applies equally to both the sets of taxpayers without any distinction whatsoever. This would create an anomalous situation. We are clear in our minds that Section 4A does not admit more CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1460 OF 2013 AND 7 CIVIL PETITION NO. 133 OF 2012 than one interpretation as it was inserted in the 2001 Ordinance with the rider that it is subject to the other provisions of the said Ordinance and none of its provisions permit splitting of the period a tax year for the purposes of determining one tax liability for one period and the other for the other period of the same tax year. Therefore, the only way Section 4A would have become workable for the purposes of computing surcharge keeping within the four corners of the Ordinance was that the tax liability of the entire tax year 2011 was proportionately divided in order to notionally work out the tax liability for the 3 month period that falls between 16.03.2011 and 30.06.2011 and then liability of surcharge is computed on such determination. 8. The respondent follows normal tax year of twelve months that ends every year on 30t June. Whatever advance tax was recovered from the respondent at the import stage during the entire tax year 2011 that had become his final tax liability for the entire tax year 2011. As income tax liability for the whole tax year had already stood determined then this tax liability was to be proportionately divided in order to determine the notional tax liability of 3 month period and on that surcharge under Section 4A of the 2001 Ordinance was to be computed. For example, income tax liability of the respondent for the entire tax year 2011 is assumed to be Rs.120,000, the same was to be divided by 12 and then multiplied by 3 which would have given proportionate income tax liability for the 3 month period, which comes to Rs.35,000/-. Rs.120,000 12 x 3 Rs.35,000 . On this proportionate tax liability 15 surcharge payable under Section 4A of the 2001 Ordinance was to be calculated. The Circular in question had only explained the only possible way the surcharge under Section 4A could be computed by remaining within the ambit of the provisions of the 2001 Ordinance. 9. We may also point out an important aspect of the case which had escaped the attention of the advocates of the parties as well as the learned judges of the High Court. When we read Section 4A 1 of the 2001 Ordinance, it states that surcharge was to be calculated ....for the period commencing from the promulgation of CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1460 OF 2013 AND 8 CIVIL PETITION NO. 133 OF 2012 this Ordinance, till the 30th June, 2011. This clearly means that Section 4A in its application came into effect right from the date of the promulgation of the 2001 Ordinance i.e. the year 2001 till 30.06.2011 which application was then restricted to only tax year 2011 by its proviso which reads Provided that this surcharge shall not be payable for the tax year 2010 and prior tax years and shall be applicable, subject to the provisions of sub-section 1 , for the tax year 2011 only. The proviso makes Section 4A effective for the tax year 2011 only. By no means Section 4A is to be read to mean that it covers only a part of the tax year, 2011. Probably realizing the fact that Section 4A, in its application covers the entire tax year 2011 though inserted in the 2001 Ordinance on 16.03.2011 i.e. during the course of tax year 2011, FBR through its Circular No.11 of 2011 announced that the surcharge was to be paid with effect from 16.03.2011 i.e. the day Section 4A was inserted in the 2001 Ordinance till 30.06.2011 which was to be computed on the basis of proportionate tax liability of the tax year 2011. This Circular in effect granted concession to the taxpayers otherwise Section 4A had covered the entire tax year 2011 and not any part of it. Probably realizing the fact that FBR through its circulars cannot grant any concession, the same was followed by the Federal Government s Notification SRO 977 1 2011 dated 19.10.2011 which was issued in exercise of the power conferred on it under Sub-Section 2 of Section 53 of the 2001 Ordinance whereby Clause 11 was added in Part III of the Second Schedule. Clause 11 provided The amount of surcharge payable on the income tax liability for the tax year 2011 under Section 4A shall be computed on the proportionate amount of income tax liability for three and a half months. The said SRO which was issued by the Federal Government in exercise of powers contained in Section 53 of the 2001 Ordinance and granted exemption in the sense that it limited the application of Section 4A to only 3 month period, which in terms of Section 4A covered the entire tax year 2011 and while extending such exemption, provided the mode in which the surcharge was to be computed i.e. on the basis of proportionate tax liability of the tax year 2011. Hence the said SRO 977 1 2011 dated 19.10.2011 on its own strength had the force of law and CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1460 OF 2013 AND 9 CIVIL PETITION NO. 133 OF 2012 never came under challenge. So has to be given effect to regardless of the FBR s Circular dated 12.09.2011, which only was challenge was challenged in the High Court. 10. The above are the detailed reasons of our short order dated 09.03.2020 whereby the delay was condoned, this appeal was allowed and the connected Civil Petition No. 133 of 2020 was converted into appeal and allowed. The short order reads as follows:- We have heard the C.P. No. 133 of 2013 and have arrived at the conclusion that the surcharge levied under Section 4A of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 added thereto by Income Tax Amendment Ordinance IV of 2011 levies a surcharge on the income tax payable for the entire tax year. Accordingly, for reasons to be recorded later, this petition is converted into appeal and allowed. 2. In Civil Appeal No. 1460 of 2013 leave was granted by order dated 02.12.2013 but subject to the question of limitation as the petition is admittedly barred by O9 days. According to the principle laid down in Mehreen Zaibun Nisa etc. versus Land Commissioner, Multan etc PLD 1975 SC 397 and Province of Punjab versus Muhammad Tayyab 1989 SCMR 1621 when a common question of law is decided in one case, another case involving the same point that is time barred is liable to be heard on merits. Consequently, following the said principle, we condone the delay and insofar as the merits are concerned, for reasons to be recorded later, we allow this appeal.

substantial income in the last 3 month period of the tax year 2011 in comparison to first 8 month period of the tax year 2011.", "For them the interpretation of the learned judges of High Court which splits the tax year into two would not be of any benefit as proportionate determination of taxable liability would be more suitable to them.", "Whereas the other set of taxpayers like the respondent to whom the splitting of the tax year for the purposes of determination of taxable income and on that tax liability is computed separately would be more beneficial instead of proportionate allocation of tax liability.", "This would mean to vary the interpretation in order to give beneficial interpretation.", "The Courts cannot put two separate interpretations of the same provision of law on the principle of beneficial interpretation, one of which is beneficial to one set of taxpayers and the other to another, though the taxing provision applies equally to both the sets of taxpayers without any distinction whatsoever.", "This would create an anomalous situation.", "We are clear in our minds that Section 4A does not admit more CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1460 OF 2013 AND 7 CIVIL PETITION NO.", "133 OF 2012 than one interpretation as it was inserted in the 2001 Ordinance with the rider that it is subject to the other provisions of the said Ordinance and none of its provisions permit splitting of the period a tax year for the purposes of determining one tax liability for one period and the other for the other period of the same tax year.", "Therefore, the only way Section 4A would have become workable for the purposes of computing surcharge keeping within the four corners of the Ordinance was that the tax liability of the entire tax year 2011 was proportionately divided in order to notionally work out the tax liability for the 3 month period that falls between 16.03.2011 and 30.06.2011 and then liability of surcharge is computed on such determination.", "The respondent follows normal tax year of twelve months that ends every year on 30t June.", "Whatever advance tax was recovered from the respondent at the import stage during the entire tax year 2011 that had become his final tax liability for the entire tax year 2011.", "As income tax liability for the whole tax year had already stood determined then this tax liability was to be proportionately divided in order to determine the notional tax liability of 3 month period and on that surcharge under Section 4A of the 2001 Ordinance was to be computed.", "For example, income tax liability of the respondent for the entire tax year 2011 is assumed to be Rs.120,000, the same was to be divided by 12 and then multiplied by 3 which would have given proportionate income tax liability for the 3 month period, which comes to Rs.35,000/-.", "Rs.120,000 12 x 3 Rs.35,000 .", "On this proportionate tax liability 15 surcharge payable under Section 4A of the 2001 Ordinance was to be calculated.", "The Circular in question had only explained the only possible way the surcharge under Section 4A could be computed by remaining within the ambit of the provisions of the 2001 Ordinance.", "We may also point out an important aspect of the case which had escaped the attention of the advocates of the parties as well as the learned judges of the High Court.", "When we read Section 4A 1 of the 2001 Ordinance, it states that surcharge was to be calculated ....for the period commencing from the promulgation of CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1460 OF 2013 AND 8 CIVIL PETITION NO.", "133 OF 2012 this Ordinance, till the 30th June, 2011.", "This clearly means that Section 4A in its application came into effect right from the date of the promulgation of the 2001 Ordinance i.e.", "the year 2001 till 30.06.2011 which application was then restricted to only tax year 2011 by its proviso which reads Provided that this surcharge shall not be payable for the tax year 2010 and prior tax years and shall be applicable, subject to the provisions of sub-section 1 , for the tax year 2011 only.", "The proviso makes Section 4A effective for the tax year 2011 only.", "By no means Section 4A is to be read to mean that it covers only a part of the tax year, 2011.", "Probably realizing the fact that Section 4A, in its application covers the entire tax year 2011 though inserted in the 2001 Ordinance on 16.03.2011 i.e.", "during the course of tax year 2011, FBR through its Circular No.11 of 2011 announced that the surcharge was to be paid with effect from 16.03.2011 i.e.", "the day Section 4A was inserted in the 2001 Ordinance till 30.06.2011 which was to be computed on the basis of proportionate tax liability of the tax year 2011.", "This Circular in effect granted concession to the taxpayers otherwise Section 4A had covered the entire tax year 2011 and not any part of it.", "Probably realizing the fact that FBR through its circulars cannot grant any concession, the same was followed by the Federal Government s Notification SRO 977 1 2011 dated 19.10.2011 which was issued in exercise of the power conferred on it under Sub-Section 2 of Section 53 of the 2001 Ordinance whereby Clause 11 was added in Part III of the Second Schedule.", "Clause 11 provided The amount of surcharge payable on the income tax liability for the tax year 2011 under Section 4A shall be computed on the proportionate amount of income tax liability for three and a half months.", "The said SRO which was issued by the Federal Government in exercise of powers contained in Section 53 of the 2001 Ordinance and granted exemption in the sense that it limited the application of Section 4A to only 3 month period, which in terms of Section 4A covered the entire tax year 2011 and while extending such exemption, provided the mode in which the surcharge was to be computed i.e.", "on the basis of proportionate tax liability of the tax year 2011.", "Hence the said SRO 977 1 2011 dated 19.10.2011 on its own strength had the force of law and CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1460 OF 2013 AND 9 CIVIL PETITION NO.", "133 OF 2012 never came under challenge.", "So has to be given effect to regardless of the FBR s Circular dated 12.09.2011, which only was challenge was challenged in the High Court.", "The above are the detailed reasons of our short order dated 09.03.2020 whereby the delay was condoned, this appeal was allowed and the connected Civil Petition No. 133 of 2020 was converted into appeal and allowed.", "The short order reads as follows:- We have heard the C.P.", "No. 133 of 2013 and have arrived at the conclusion that the surcharge levied under Section 4A of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 added thereto by Income Tax Amendment Ordinance IV of 2011 levies a surcharge on the income tax payable for the entire tax year.", "Accordingly, for reasons to be recorded later, this petition is converted into appeal and allowed.", "In Civil Appeal No. 1460 of 2013 leave was granted by order dated 02.12.2013 but subject to the

The High Court maintained petitioner’s conviction albeit with\nalteration of death penalty into imprisonment for life while acquitting\nMuhammad Naveed and Muhammad Saeed from the charge vide\nimpugned judgment dated 30.10.2013, vires whereof, are being assailed\nboth by the complainant as well as the convict. Issues being inter\nlinked, the captioned petitions are being decided through this single\njudgment.\n\n2. Learned counsel for the petitioner/convict contends that\nafter acquittal of three out of four accused, each assigned a distinct\nrole, there was no occasion for the High Court to rely upon the same\ndiscredited evidence qua the petitioner to maintain his conviction.\nLearned counsel for the complainant, contrarily, not only prayed for\nreversal of death penalty but also acquittal recorded qua the co-accused\non the ground that there was no occasion for the High Court, after it\nhad believed the witnesses, to acquit the respondents assigned a role\nconfirmed by medical evidence merely on a conjectural premise.\nLearned Law Officer wholeheartedly agreed with the conclusions drawn\nby the High Court.\n\n3. Heard. Record perused.\n\n4. Petitioner is assigned fatal blow. According to the autopsy\nreport, conducted at 2:30 p.m. same day, it is an incised wound of quite\nan extensive nature, penetrating into brain cavity; it is consistent with\nhatchet P-3, found stained with blood, forensically opined that of\nhuman origin, recovered pursuant his disclosure on 6.11.2009.\nInfliction of the fatal blow at petitioner’s hand has unanimously been\nconfirmed by the witnesses; occurrence being a broad daylight affair on\na thoroughfare within the vicinity of inhabitation, inculpatory\ninvestigative conclusions, being in line therewith, have not been found\nby us as open to any legitimate exception. Jafar Hussain, real father of\n\nthe accused, is saddled with instigation; he has rightly been acquitted\n\nCriminal Petition Nos.1322-L, 1296-L & 1297-L of 2013 3\n\nby the trial Court; whereas triviality of abrasions, swayed on the High\nCourt to exercise caution qua Muhammad Naveed and Muhammad\nSaeed is an equally expedient choice. Doctrine of abundant caution is a\nsilver lining in our jurisprudence to ensure safe administration of\ncriminal justice and application thereof does not necessarily imply\ndestruction of entire volume of evidence, if otherwise found sufficient to\nsustain the centrality of the charge.

Criminal Petition Nos.1322-L, 1296-L 1297-L of 2013 2 According to the prosecution, on the fateful day, deceased on a motorbike, was surprised by the accused, in the backdrop of a previous brawl. The petitioner was returned a guilty verdict vide judgment dated 8.4.2010; convicted under clause b of section 302 of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 and sentenced to death whereas Muhammad Naveed and Muhammad Saeed, co-accused to imprisonment for life for being in the community of intention; Jafar Hussain was acquitted from the charge. The High Court maintained petitioner s conviction albeit with alteration of death penalty into imprisonment for life while acquitting Muhammad Naveed and Muhammad Saeed from the charge vide impugned judgment dated 30.10.2013, vires whereof, are being assailed both by the complainant as well as the convict. Issues being inter linked, the captioned petitions are being decided through this single judgment. 2. Learned counsel for the petitioner/convict contends that after acquittal of three out of four accused, each assigned a distinct role, there was no occasion for the High Court to rely upon the same discredited evidence qua the petitioner to maintain his conviction. Learned counsel for the complainant, contrarily, not only prayed for reversal of death penalty but also acquittal recorded qua the co-accused on the ground that there was no occasion for the High Court, after it had believed the witnesses, to acquit the respondents assigned a role confirmed by medical evidence merely on a conjectural premise. Learned Law Officer wholeheartedly agreed with the conclusions drawn by the High Court. 3. Heard. Record perused. 4. Petitioner is assigned fatal blow. According to the autopsy report, conducted at 2:30 p.m. same day, it is an incised wound of quite an extensive nature, penetrating into brain cavity; it is consistent with hatchet P-3, found stained with blood, forensically opined that of human origin, recovered pursuant his disclosure on 6.11.2009. Infliction of the fatal blow at petitioner s hand has unanimously been confirmed by the witnesses; occurrence being a broad daylight affair on a thoroughfare within the vicinity of inhabitation, inculpatory investigative conclusions, being in line therewith, have not been found by us as open to any legitimate exception. Jafar Hussain, real father of the accused, is saddled with instigation; he has rightly been acquitted Criminal Petition Nos.1322-L, 1296-L 1297-L of 2013 3 by the trial Court; whereas triviality of abrasions, swayed on the High Court to exercise caution qua Muhammad Naveed and Muhammad Saeed is an equally expedient choice. Doctrine of abundant caution is a silver lining in our jurisprudence to ensure safe administration of criminal justice and application thereof does not necessarily imply destruction of entire volume of evidence, if otherwise found sufficient to sustain the centrality of the charge.

Mirza Sultan Baig died on 2274 March 1975\nleaving behind a widow Mst. Tahira Sultana, two sons, namely\nMirza Abid Baig and Mirza Imran Baig, and four daughters, namely\nAbida Azam, Zahida Sabir, Naveeda Sultan (Pasha) and Fakhira\nTariq. A suit for the administration of the estate of their father and\nrendition of accounts was filed by Abida Azam (plaintiff No. 1) and\nZahida Sabir (plaintiff No. 2) on 28th May 1980. They mentioned\nthe properties in the plaint which were left by their father and\n\nsought their shares therein as per shariah.\n\n2. The suit was decreed on 26 March 1992 with regard to two\nproperties, that is house No. 69 (its previous number was 118),\nGarden Block, situated in the New Garden Town, Lahore,\n\nmeasuring 6 kanals and a shop situated in Ram Gali No. 2, Lahore\n\nC. A. No. 472/2013\n\n(‘the said house and shop”). Mirza Abid Baig filed an appeal\nchallenging the judgment and decree. Another appeal was filed by\nhis mother, brother and two sisters, namely Naveeda Pasha and\nFakhira Tariq. Both the appeals were dismissed vide judgment\ndated 3'4 January 1995. Thereafter, civil revision petition was filed\nby Mirza Abid Baig and during its pendency he entered into a\ncompromise with his sister Abida Azam (plaintiff No.1 in the suit)\nwho upon receipt of one million and four hundred thousand\nrupees withdrew her suit and the said petition was disposed of on\n\n224d November 1995.\n\n3. On 21st October 1997 Naveeda Pasha, Zahida Sabir and\nFakhira Tariq filed an application under section 12 (2) of the Code\nof Civil Procedure (“the Code”) in the High Court followed by a\nsimilar application filed the other brother/son, Mirza Imran Baig.\nThe learned Judge of the High Court recalled the order disposing of\nthe revision petition and remanded the matter to the Appellate\nCourt to record evidence to verify whether a statement was made\nby the counsel on behalf of their clients to bind them. Evidence\nwas recorded by the Appellate Court which was transmitted to the\nHigh Court for consideration. The learned Judge of the High Court\non 9t August 2003 concluded that the person who had affected\nthe compromise on behalf of the sisters was not legally authorized\nas a counsel to do so and, consequently by consent, both\napplications under section 12 (2) of the Code were accepted and\n\nthe revision petition stood revived.\n\n4. Thereafter, when the revision petition was fixed for hearing it\nwas pointed out to the learned Judge of the High Court by Mirza\nAbid Baig that an application under Order XXIII rule 1 of the Code\nwas filed by Zahida Siddiqi, which was stated to be another name\nof Zahida Sabir, (“the purported compromise application”) before\nthe Appellate Court on 20t October 1993 which had escaped the\nattention of the learned Judge of the Appellate Court. Therefore,\nthe matter was again remanded to the Appellate Court to consider\n\nthe purported compromise application and whether it was filed\n\nC. A. No. 472/2013\n\nunder undue influence or coercion. Zahida Sabir/Siddiqi, who\nallegedly signed the purported compromise application, had died in\nthe year 2003 before any order was passed on it. Zahida Sabir’s\nlegal heirs withdrew the purported compromise application on 11th\nJuly 2008. Then on 30% July 2008 Mirza Abid Baig filed an\napplication under Order XLI rule 27 of the Code to bring on record\nadditional evidence which was a two-page agreement dated 16th\nOctober 1993 (“the purported agreement”) which said that\nZahida Sabir had given up her claim on payment of seven hundred\nthousand rupees. After recording of evidence Mirza Abid Baig’s\nappeal was accepted to the extent of the claim of Zahida Sabir. The\nlegal heirs of Zahida Sabir challenged this decision by filing a civil\nrevision petition before the High Court and the learned Judge of\nthe High Court set aside the finding and decision of the Appellate\nCourt vide impugned judgment dated 6'» February 2013.\n\n5. Mr. Muhammad Atif Amin, the learned counsel representing\nthe appellant Mirza Abid Baig, states that the Appellate Court after\nrecording evidence had concluded, on the basis of testimonies of\nwitnesses and documents, that Zahida Sabir had executed the\npurported compromise application and the purported agreement.\nThe learned counsel referred to the testimonies of Muhammad\nSiddiq (AW-1) and Anwar Khan (AW-3) and stated that these\nwitnesses had testified to the execution of the purported agreement\nand that cash payment of seven hundred thousand rupees was\npaid by Mirza Abid Baig to Zahida Sabir. He further states that in\nthe application under section 12 (2) of the Code, which was filed by\nZahida Sabir in her lifetime, she had admitted signing the\n\npurported compromise application.\n\n6. Mr. Mustafa Ramday, the learned counsel for the respondent\nNos. 1(a) to 1(d), who are the children and legal heirs of Zahida\nSabir, states that Mirza Sultan Baig died on 2274 March 1975 and\non his death his legal heirs immediately became owners of his\nestate and entitled to receive their shares in accordance with\n\nshariah, however, some of the legal heirs were deprived and were\n\nC. A. No. 472/2013\n\ncompelled to file a suit for administration and rendition of\naccounts, which was decreed by the learned Civil Judge, Lahore in\naccordance with law. Mirza Abid Baig however left no stone\nunturned in keeping the legal heirs deprived of their inheritance on\ntenuous grounds. The learned counsel submits that Mirza Abid\nBaig took one false plea after another to deprive his sisters of their\ninheritance; in his written statement he even denied that the\nplaintiffs were the legal heirs of Mirza Sultan Baig; he also denied\nthat Mirza Sultan Baig “was the legal real owner’ of the said house\nand shop and that when these false pleas collapsed the purported\ncompromise application and the purported agreement emerged.\nThe purported compromise application was stated to have been\nfiled on 20t October 1993 however the learned Appellate Court\nJudge proceeded to decide the case on merits on 34 January 1995,\nwhich, learned counsel submits, incontrovertibly establishes the\nabsence of the purported compromise application from the Court\nrecord, because the learned Judge would not needlessly decide a\ncase on merits which had already been compromised. The only\npurported record of the filing of the purported compromise\napplication was a note made in the margin of the order sheet\nmaintained by the Court Reader which note, according to the\nlearned counsel, was fraudulently inserted, which was discussed\nand discarded by the learned Judge of the High Court in the\nimpugned judgment. He further states that, the purported\ncompromise application did not refer to the purported agreement;\nthe purported compromise application simply stated “the applicant\nhas settled her dispute with the appellant outside the Court’ and\nthat “the applicant intends to withdraw her suit and also has no\nobjection in the acceptance of the appeal as prayed for’ and did not\nrefer to any purported agreement, which if it had been executed\nwould have been mentioned therein; the purported agreement first\nsurfaced on 30th July 2008 after the matter was remanded the\nsecond time, confirming that it was not executed by the late Zahida\nSabir. He also referred to the signatures on the purported\ncompromise application and the purported agreement which were\n\nsigned in Urdu and showed to be signed as Zahida Siddiqi and not\n\nC. A. No. 472/2013\n\nZahida Sabir which is how she signed [emphasis added]; the\nlearned counsel referred to the plaint and other documents which\n\nwere signed as Zahida Sabir.\n\n7. Making his legal submissions the learned Mr. Mustafa\nRamday submits that Order XXIII rule 1(4) of the Code states that\nthe ‘consent’ of the other plaintiffs was needed before withdrawing\na case where there are more than one plaintiff, however, the\nconsent of Abida Azam, the other plaintiff, was not obtained.\nLearned counsel refers to a decision in the case of Umar Bakhsh v\nAzim Khan! which held that, “Court would consider the document to\nbe compromise when both parties signing it agree and reiterate the\ncontents before the Court. If before the Court one party to the\ndocument resiles from it, then the document can be called anything\nbut an agreement or compromise”. Learned counsel states that the\npurported compromise application was not accepted by the Court\nand it had been withdrawn, therefore it was of no legal effect and\nshould not have been considered. He alternatively submits that\nsince the purported compromise application was wholly without\nconsideration it was void in terms section 25 of the Contract Act,\n1872 and relies on the case of Sadar Din v Khatoon? where\nrelinquishment of rights in property without consideration was,\n“found to be a nullity in the eye of the law on account of section 25\nof the Contract Act, 1872”. He says, that relinquishment of rights\ncould not be lightly implied and cogent evidence in this regard had\nto be produced; there was no evidence of the payment of seven\nhundred thousand rupees and the entire story was false. He\nsubmits that this Court has always taken great exception when\nladies are denied their property rights by male members of the\nfamily and in this regard referred to the case of Ghulam Ali v\nGhulam Sarwar Naqvi (Mst.)+. Concluding his submissions, the\n\nlearned counsel submits that the Appellate Court had exceeded the\n\n1993 SCMR 374\n1993 SCMR 374, 380E\n2004 SCMR 1102\n\n1\n2\n3\n4 PLD 1990 Supreme Court 1\n\nC. A. No. 472/2013\n\ndirections of the High Court when the case was remanded to it and\nunnecessarily widened the controversy of the suit and that the\nlearned Civil Court Judge and the learned High Court Judge had\n\ncorrectly decided the matter.\n\n8. We have heard the learned counsel and with their assistance\nexamined the documents on record. This case is yet another sad\nexample of a brother denying and resisting the claim of his sisters\nto their legal entitlement to inheritance. Mirza Sultan Baig died on\n22.4 March 1975 and when he died his properties came to vest in\nhis legal heirs and should have been distributed among them in\naccordance with shariah but this was not done compelling two of\nhis daughters to file a suit to get what was due to them. Mirza Abid\nBaig stooped to denying that his sisters were the legal heirs of\nMirza Sultan Baig. He also, without any proof, claimed that his\nfather was not the legal owner of the said house and shop,\ninsinuating but without stating, let alone establishing, that he was\ntheir real owner and that his father was the benami (ostensible)\nowner. The learned Civil Judge, Lahore decreed the suit in respect\nof only two of the properties, that is the said house and shop, but\nthis too was not acceptable to Mirza Abid Baig who continued to\nthrow one unnecessary challenge after another to prevent his\nsisters from getting their inheritance and regrettably succeeded by\nsuch tactics as Zahida Sabir passed away and it is now forty-five\nyears since she and then her children have remained deprived of\ninheritance. Such conduct of the appellant contravened the law\nand also the dictates of Almighty Allah; shariah expounds that\nlegal heirs immediately on the death of their predecessor become\n\nowners of the estate left behind as per their predetermined shares.\n\n9. The rights of Zahida Sabir to the extent of the said two\nproperties had been determined by the Court however Mirza Abid\nBaig then produced the purported compromise application and\nlong afterwards emerged the purported agreement. No explanation\nwas forthcoming why these documents remained under wraps. It is\n\nunbelievable that counsel would have kept silent and let the\n\nC. A. No. 472/2013\n\nlearned Judge decide the case on merits when Zahida Sabir had\nalready withdrawn her claim against her brother. It is thus quite\nclear to us that Mirza Abid Baig had staged the whole thing; the\npurported compromise application was neither executed nor filed\nand the purported agreement was not executed. The purported\nagreement is dated 16th October 1993 but is brought forward after\nfifteen years, in the year 2008. The purported agreement left blank\nthe place where the consideration amount was to be written. Mirza\nAbid Baig testified that he had inserted in his hand an amount of\n“700,000/=” which he said was paid in cash but failed to establish\nthe particular fact of payment having been made to Zahida Sabir®.\nMirza Abid Baig further destroyed his credibility by preposterously\nalleging that his sister was not entitled to inherit from her father’s\nestate. He further stated that the amount paid by him to her was\nnot in settlement of her inheritance, which then raised the\n\nquestion why was payment made, but no answer was forthcoming.\n\n10. The purported compromise application is dated 20‘ October\n1993 but the learned Appellate Court Judge decided the case on\nmerits on 3'¢ January 1995, it is therefore clear, that it did not\nexist on the Court record till 34 January 1995 because the learned\nJudge would not have spent time to decide a case on merits which\nhad already been compromised. And, if, for the sake of argument,\nit is assumed that the learned Judge had overlooked the said\napplication it is unbelievable that neither the learned counsel\nappearing in the case nor the parties would draw his attention to\nit, thereby further confirming that the purported compromise\napplication did not exist. Mirza Abid Baig’s counsel has referred to\na note made in the margin of the order sheet maintained by the\nCourt Reader, however, no credence can be placed on this note\nbecause it is completely incongruous with the facts. We have also\nobserved that the purported compromise application did not refer\nto the purported agreement which is also inexplicable. As if this\n\nwas not enough the purported agreement surfaced fifteen years\n\n5 Article 119 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984\n\nC. A. No. 472/2013\n\nafter its alleged execution without an explanation offered as to why\nit was not disclosed earlier. The signature of Zahida Sabir on both\nthese documents was also different from her signature on the\nplaint and other admitted documents. Both these documents were\nalso thumb-impressed by her therefore it was relatively easy to\nestablish if she had affixed her thumb impression thereon by\nsending them for forensic examination but Mirza Abid Baig did not\nelect to do so and thus an adverse presumption can be drawn\nagainst him. The burden to prove the two self-serving documents\n(the purported compromise application and the purported\nagreement) lay on Mirza Abid Baig® but he did not discharge the\nburden of proof’. The purported compromise application lay\nunattended and was in turn withdrawn by the legal heirs of the\nZahida Sabir before any order was passed thereon. The filing of an\napplication under Order XXIII rule 1 of the Code, which seeks to\nwithdraw a suit or claim, is not tantamount to the withdrawal of\nthe suit or claim. The purported compromise application and the\npurported agreement were stated to have been executed on\npayment of compensation of seven hundred thousand rupees but\nMirza Abid Baig failed to establish that such payment was made,\ntherefore, these documents were void in terms of section 25 of the\n\nContract Act, 1872.\n\n11. We cannot be unmindful of the fact that often times male\nmembers of a family deprive their female relatives of their legal\nentitlement to inheritance and in doing so shariah and law is\nviolated. Vulnerable women are also sometimes compelled to\nrelinquish their entitlement to inheritance in favour of their male\nrelations. This Court in the case of Ghulam Ali® had observed that\n‘relinquishment’ by female members of the family was contrary to\npublic policy and contrary to shariah. It would be useful to\n\nreproduce the following portion from the decision of this Court:\n\n6 article 117 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984\nT article 118 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984\n8 PLD 1990 Supreme Court 1\n\nC. A. No. 472/2013\n\n“Here in the light of the foregoing discussion on the Islamic\npoint of view, the so-called “relinquishment” by a female of\nher inheritance as has taken place in this case, is\nundoubtedly opposed to “public policy” as understood in\nthe Islamic sense with reference to Islamic jurisprudence.\nIn addition it may be mentioned that Islam visualised many\nmodes of circulation of wealth of certain types under certain\nstrict conditions. And when commenting on one of the\nmany methods of achieving this object, almost all\ncommentators on Islamic System agree with variance of\ndegree only, that the strict enforcement of laws of\ninheritance is an important accepted method in Islam for\nachieving circulation of wealth. That being so, it is an\nadditional object of public policy. In other words the\ndisputed relinquishment of right of inheritance, relied upon\nfrom the petitioner’s side, even if proved against\nrespondent, has to be found against public policy.\nAccordingly the respondent’s action in agreeing to the\nrelinquishment (though denied by her) being against public\npolicy the very act of agreement and contract constituting\nthe relinquishment, was void.”9\n\n12. The learned Judge of the High Court, exercising revisional\njurisdiction under section 115 of the Code, had correctly noted\nthat the Appellate Court had wrongly exercised its jurisdiction, had\nmisread evidence, disregarded crucial evidence, relied on the\npurported compromise application which Mirza Abid Baig could\nnot establish was part of the Court record, gave credence to\npurported agreement without the concomitant obligation of making\npayment and wrongly assumed that a valuable claim was\nrelinquished without proof and without consideration. Therefore,\nthere is no reason to allow this appeal which is dismissed with\ncosts throughout. The costs shall be paid to the respondent Nos.\nl(a) to 1(d). Since the said respondents and before them their\nmother stood deprived of inheritance for forty-five years, we expect\nthat if the matter goes to the Executing Court it will ensure that\nthe matter is promptly concluded without entertaining frivolous\nobjections from the appellant to further procrastinate the misery of\n\nthe said respondents.\n\nJudge\n\n° PLD 1990 Supreme Court 1, 21 [placitum CC, DD and EE]\n\nC.

Mirza Sultan Baig died on 2274 March 1975 leaving behind a widow Mst. Tahira Sultana, two sons, namely Mirza Abid Baig and Mirza Imran Baig, and four daughters, namely Abida Azam, Zahida Sabir, Naveeda Sultan Pasha and Fakhira Tariq. A suit for the administration of the estate of their father and rendition of accounts was filed by Abida Azam plaintiff No. 1 and Zahida Sabir plaintiff No. 2 on 28th May 1980. They mentioned the properties in the plaint which were left by their father and sought their shares therein as per shariah. 2. The suit was decreed on 26 March 1992 with regard to two properties, that is house No. 69 its previous number was 118 , Garden Block, situated in the New Garden Town, Lahore, measuring 6 kanals and a shop situated in Ram Gali No. 2, Lahore C. A. No. 472/2013 the said house and shop . Mirza Abid Baig filed an appeal challenging the judgment and decree. Another appeal was filed by his mother, brother and two sisters, namely Naveeda Pasha and Fakhira Tariq. Both the appeals were dismissed vide judgment dated 3 4 January 1995. Thereafter, civil revision petition was filed by Mirza Abid Baig and during its pendency he entered into a compromise with his sister Abida Azam plaintiff No.1 in the suit who upon receipt of one million and four hundred thousand rupees withdrew her suit and the said petition was disposed of on 224d November 1995. 3. On 21st October 1997 Naveeda Pasha, Zahida Sabir and Fakhira Tariq filed an application under section 12 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure the Code in the High Court followed by a similar application filed the other brother/son, Mirza Imran Baig. The learned Judge of the High Court recalled the order disposing of the revision petition and remanded the matter to the Appellate Court to record evidence to verify whether a statement was made by the counsel on behalf of their clients to bind them. Evidence was recorded by the Appellate Court which was transmitted to the High Court for consideration. The learned Judge of the High Court on 9t August 2003 concluded that the person who had affected the compromise on behalf of the sisters was not legally authorized as a counsel to do so and, consequently by consent, both applications under section 12 2 of the Code were accepted and the revision petition stood revived. 4. Thereafter, when the revision petition was fixed for hearing it was pointed out to the learned Judge of the High Court by Mirza Abid Baig that an application under Order XXIII rule 1 of the Code was filed by Zahida Siddiqi, which was stated to be another name of Zahida Sabir, the purported compromise application before the Appellate Court on 20t October 1993 which had escaped the attention of the learned Judge of the Appellate Court. Therefore, the matter was again remanded to the Appellate Court to consider the purported compromise application and whether it was filed C. A. No. 472/2013 under undue influence or coercion. Zahida Sabir/Siddiqi, who allegedly signed the purported compromise application, had died in the year 2003 before any order was passed on it. Zahida Sabir s legal heirs withdrew the purported compromise application on 11th July 2008. Then on 30 July 2008 Mirza Abid Baig filed an application under Order XLI rule 27 of the Code to bring on record additional evidence which was a two-page agreement dated 16th October 1993 the purported agreement which said that Zahida Sabir had given up her claim on payment of seven hundred thousand rupees. After recording of evidence Mirza Abid Baig s appeal was accepted to the extent of the claim of Zahida Sabir. The legal heirs of Zahida Sabir challenged this decision by filing a civil revision petition before the High Court and the learned Judge of the High Court set aside the finding and decision of the Appellate Court vide impugned judgment dated 6 February 2013. 5. Mr. Muhammad Atif Amin, the learned counsel representing the appellant Mirza Abid Baig, states that the Appellate Court after recording evidence had concluded, on the basis of testimonies of witnesses and documents, that Zahida Sabir had executed the purported compromise application and the purported agreement. The learned counsel referred to the testimonies of Muhammad Siddiq AW-1 and Anwar Khan AW-3 and stated that these witnesses had testified to the execution of the purported agreement and that cash payment of seven hundred thousand rupees was paid by Mirza Abid Baig to Zahida Sabir. He further states that in the application under section 12 2 of the Code, which was filed by Zahida Sabir in her lifetime, she had admitted signing the purported compromise application. 6. Mr. Mustafa Ramday, the learned counsel for the respondent Nos. 1 a to 1 d , who are the children and legal heirs of Zahida Sabir, states that Mirza Sultan Baig died on 2274 March 1975 and on his death his legal heirs immediately became owners of his estate and entitled to receive their shares in accordance with shariah, however, some of the legal heirs were deprived and were C. A. No. 472/2013 compelled to file a suit for administration and rendition of accounts, which was decreed by the learned Civil Judge, Lahore in accordance with law. Mirza Abid Baig however left no stone unturned in keeping the legal heirs deprived of their inheritance on tenuous grounds. The learned counsel submits that Mirza Abid Baig took one false plea after another to deprive his sisters of their inheritance; in his written statement he even denied that the plaintiffs were the legal heirs of Mirza Sultan Baig; he also denied that Mirza Sultan Baig was the legal real owner of the said house and shop and that when these false pleas collapsed the purported compromise application and the purported agreement emerged. The purported compromise application was stated to have been filed on 20t October 1993 however the learned Appellate Court Judge proceeded to decide the case on merits on 34 January 1995, which, learned counsel submits, incontrovertibly establishes the absence of the purported compromise application from the Court record, because the learned Judge would not needlessly decide a case on merits which had already been compromised. The only purported record of the filing of the purported compromise application was a note made in the margin of the order sheet maintained by the Court Reader which note, according to the learned counsel, was fraudulently inserted, which was discussed and discarded by the learned Judge of the High Court in the impugned judgment. He further states that, the purported compromise application did not refer to the purported agreement; the purported compromise application simply stated the applicant has settled her dispute with the appellant outside the Court and that the applicant intends to withdraw her suit and also has no objection in the acceptance of the appeal as prayed for and did not refer to any purported agreement, which if it had been executed would have been mentioned therein; the purported agreement first surfaced on 30th July 2008 after the matter was remanded the second time, confirming that it was not executed by the late Zahida Sabir. He also referred to the signatures on the purported compromise application and the purported agreement which were signed in Urdu and showed to be signed as Zahida Siddiqi and not C. A. No. 472/2013 Zahida Sabir which is how she signed emphasis added ; the learned counsel referred to the plaint and other documents which were signed as Zahida Sabir. 7. Making his legal submissions the learned Mr. Mustafa Ramday submits that Order XXIII rule 1 4 of the Code states that the consent of the other plaintiffs was needed before withdrawing a case where there are more than one plaintiff, however, the consent of Abida Azam, the other plaintiff, was not obtained. Learned counsel refers to a decision in the case of Umar Bakhsh v Azim Khan! which held that, Court would consider the document to be compromise when both parties signing it agree and reiterate the contents before the Court. If before the Court one party to the document resiles from it, then the document can be called anything but an agreement or compromise . Learned counsel states that the purported compromise application was not accepted by the Court and it had been withdrawn, therefore it was of no legal effect and should not have been considered. He alternatively submits that since the purported compromise application was wholly without consideration it was void in terms section 25 of the Contract Act, 1872 and relies on the case of Sadar Din v Khatoon? where relinquishment of rights in property without consideration was, found to be a nullity in the eye of the law on account of section 25 of the Contract Act, 1872 . He says, that relinquishment of rights could not be lightly implied and cogent evidence in this regard had to be produced; there was no evidence of the payment of seven hundred thousand rupees and the entire story was false. He submits that this Court has always taken great exception when ladies are denied their property rights by male members of the family and in this regard referred to the case of Ghulam Ali v Ghulam Sarwar Naqvi Mst. . Concluding his submissions, the learned counsel submits that the Appellate Court had exceeded the 1993 SCMR 374 1993 SCMR 374, 380E 2004 SCMR 1102 1 2 3 4 PLD 1990 Supreme Court 1 C. A. No. 472/2013 directions of the High Court when the case was remanded to it and unnecessarily widened the controversy of the suit and that the learned Civil Court Judge and the learned High Court Judge had correctly decided the matter. 8. We have heard the learned counsel and with their assistance examined the documents on record. This case is yet another sad example of a brother denying and resisting the claim of his sisters to their legal entitlement to inheritance. Mirza Sultan Baig died on 22.4 March 1975 and when he died his properties came to vest in his legal heirs and should have been distributed among them in accordance with shariah but this was not done compelling two of his daughters to file a suit to get what was due to them. Mirza Abid Baig stooped to denying that his sisters were the legal heirs of Mirza Sultan Baig. He also, without any proof, claimed that his father was not the legal owner of the said house and shop, insinuating but without stating, let alone establishing, that he was their real owner and that his father was the benami ostensible owner. The learned Civil Judge, Lahore decreed the suit in respect of only two of the properties, that is the said house and shop, but this too was not acceptable to Mirza Abid Baig who continued to throw one unnecessary challenge after another to prevent his sisters from getting their inheritance and regrettably succeeded by such tactics as Zahida Sabir passed away and it is now forty-five years since she and then her children have remained deprived of inheritance. Such conduct of the appellant contravened the law and also the dictates of Almighty Allah; shariah expounds that legal heirs immediately on the death of their predecessor become owners of the estate left behind as per their predetermined shares. 9. The rights of Zahida Sabir to the extent of the said two properties had been determined by the Court however Mirza Abid Baig then produced the purported compromise application and long afterwards emerged the purported agreement. No explanation was forthcoming why these documents remained under wraps. It is unbelievable that counsel would have kept silent and let the C. A. No. 472/2013 learned Judge decide the case on merits when Zahida Sabir had already withdrawn her claim against her brother. It is thus quite clear to us that Mirza Abid Baig had staged the whole thing; the purported compromise application was neither executed nor filed and the purported agreement was not executed. The purported agreement is dated 16th October 1993 but is brought forward after fifteen years, in the year 2008. The purported agreement left blank the place where the consideration amount was to be written. Mirza Abid Baig testified that he had inserted in his hand an amount of 700,000/ which he said was paid in cash but failed to establish the particular fact of payment having been made to Zahida Sabir . Mirza Abid Baig further destroyed his credibility by preposterously alleging that his sister was not entitled to inherit from her father s estate. He further stated that the amount paid by him to her was not in settlement of her inheritance, which then raised the question why was payment made, but no answer was forthcoming. 10. The purported compromise application is dated 20 October 1993 but the learned Appellate Court Judge decided the case on merits on 3 January 1995, it is therefore clear, that it did not exist on the Court record till 34 January 1995 because the learned Judge would not have spent time to decide a case on merits which had already been compromised. And, if, for the sake of argument, it is assumed that the learned Judge had overlooked the said application it is unbelievable that neither the learned counsel appearing in the case nor the parties would draw his attention to it, thereby further confirming that the purported compromise application did not exist. Mirza Abid Baig s counsel has referred to a note made in the margin of the order sheet maintained by the Court Reader, however, no credence can be placed on this note because it is completely incongruous with the facts. We have also observed that the purported compromise application did not refer to the purported agreement which is also inexplicable. As if this was not enough the purported agreement surfaced fifteen years 5 Article 119 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 C. A. No. 472/2013 after its alleged execution without an explanation offered as to why it was not disclosed earlier. The signature of Zahida Sabir on both these documents was also different from her signature on the plaint and other admitted documents. Both these documents were also thumb-impressed by her therefore it was relatively easy to establish if she had affixed her thumb impression thereon by sending them for forensic examination but Mirza Abid Baig did not elect to do so and thus an adverse presumption can be drawn against him. The burden to prove the two self-serving documents the purported compromise application and the purported agreement lay on Mirza Abid Baig but he did not discharge the burden of proof . The purported compromise application lay unattended and was in turn withdrawn by the legal heirs of the Zahida Sabir before any order was passed thereon. The filing of an application under Order XXIII rule 1 of the Code, which seeks to withdraw a suit or claim, is not tantamount to the withdrawal of the suit or claim. The purported compromise application and the purported agreement were stated to have been executed on payment of compensation of seven hundred thousand rupees but Mirza Abid Baig failed to establish that such payment was made, therefore, these documents were void in terms of section 25 of the Contract Act, 1872. 11. We cannot be unmindful of the fact that often times male members of a family deprive their female relatives of their legal entitlement to inheritance and in doing so shariah and law is violated. Vulnerable women are also sometimes compelled to relinquish their entitlement to inheritance in favour of their male relations. This Court in the case of Ghulam Ali had observed that relinquishment by female members of the family was contrary to public policy and contrary to shariah. It would be useful to reproduce the following portion from the decision of this Court: 6 article 117 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 T article 118 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 8 PLD 1990 Supreme Court 1 C. A. No. 472/2013 Here in the light of the foregoing discussion on the Islamic point of view, the so-called relinquishment by a female of her inheritance as has taken place in this case, is undoubtedly opposed to public policy as understood in the Islamic sense with reference to Islamic jurisprudence. In addition it may be mentioned that Islam visualised many modes of circulation of wealth of certain types under certain strict conditions. And when commenting on one of the many methods of achieving this object, almost all commentators on Islamic System agree with variance of degree only, that the strict enforcement of laws of inheritance is an important accepted method in Islam for achieving circulation of wealth. That being so, it is an additional object of public policy. In other words the disputed relinquishment of right of inheritance, relied upon from the petitioner s side, even if proved against respondent, has to be found against public policy. Accordingly the respondent s action in agreeing to the relinquishment though denied by her being against public policy the very act of agreement and contract constituting the relinquishment, was void. 9 12. The learned Judge of the High Court, exercising revisional jurisdiction under section 115 of the Code, had correctly noted that the Appellate Court had wrongly exercised its jurisdiction, had misread evidence, disregarded crucial evidence, relied on the purported compromise application which Mirza Abid Baig could not establish was part of the Court record, gave credence to purported agreement without the concomitant obligation of making payment and wrongly assumed that a valuable claim was relinquished without proof and without consideration. Therefore, there is no reason to allow this appeal which is dismissed with costs throughout. The costs shall be paid to the respondent Nos. l a to 1 d . Since the said respondents and before them their mother stood deprived of inheritance for forty-five years, we expect that if the matter goes to the Executing Court it will ensure that the matter is promptly concluded without entertaining frivolous objections from the appellant to further procrastinate the misery of the said respondents.

The foregoing stipulation/\nclassification, founded on her gender alone, apparently sans any\nrational basis except for a dogmatic and subjective belief that she\nwould not be able to handle students placed in a slightly higher\nage group, an apprehension oriented more chauvinistically than on\nany objective foundation, therefore, the impugned policy cannot be\nviewed as prudent or expedient nor reflects intelligible differentia so\nas to qualify the precondition of being reasonable.

Half of the human resource in the Republic comprises\nof women; they are mentoring, par excellence in every walk of life;\nit is a treasure which must be utilized for a better future. The\nConstitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan preambles rights\nthat include equality of status as well as of opportunity; Article 27\n\nreads as under:-\n\n“No citizen otherwise qualified for\nappointment in the service of Pakistan shall\nbe discriminated against in respect of any\nsuch appointment on the ground only of\nrace, religion, caste, sex, residence or place\n\nof birth ....... >\n\nUnder the Principles of Policy, it is further emphasized in Article 34\nof the Constitution that:-\n\n“Steps shall be taken to ensure full\nparticipation of women in all spheres of\n\nnational life.”\n\nThe Constitution commands the Government to take meaningful\nand effective steps and formulate policies conducive to tap this\nmost important human resource by ensuring congenial working\nenvironments, free from harassment or discrimination so as to\n\nfacilitate female participation in the national life for a better and\n\nCivil Appeal No.797 of 2013 4\n\nprosperous future.

Pakistan International Airlines Corporation and others 2005 SCMR 445 and Dossani Travels Put. Ltd. Vs. Messrs Travels Shop Put. Limited PLD 2014 Supreme Court 1 to conclude that the High Court had no occasion to interfere with an administrative policy affair. 3. Heard. 4. We are not impressed by the position taken by the learned Additional Advocate General Punjab nor have found his reliance on the supra judgments, relevant to the facts of the present case, being rendered in an entirely different contextual backgrounds. In the supra case of Abdullah Mangi others, candidates for the job of flight stewards, despite initial selection and training, nonetheless, were found by the respondent-air line, ineligible on account of their failure to successfully compete with their competitors and as such the argument of discrimination by the Court was repelled. Similarly, case of Dosani Travels Put. Ltd. is structured upon vastly distinguishable facts as well as issues arising therefrom. Before us is a female, otherwise eligible on all fours, being denied a position despite having successfully Civil Appeal No.797 of 2013 3 competed for the job as an Educator in the same category of post/functional group in Boys High/Higher Secondary School, however, with a relegated opportunity to serve in the same capacity in the primary and middle sections. The foregoing stipulation/ classification, founded on her gender alone, apparently sans any rational basis except for a dogmatic and subjective belief that she would not be able to handle students placed in a slightly higher age group, an apprehension oriented more chauvinistically than on any objective foundation, therefore, the impugned policy cannot be viewed as prudent or expedient nor reflects intelligible differentia so as to qualify the precondition of being reasonable. On the contrary, it is grievously retrogressive besides being violative of Constitutional commands. 5. Half of the human resource in the Republic comprises of women; they are mentoring, par excellence in every walk of life; it is a treasure which must be utilized for a better future. The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan preambles rights that include equality of status as well as of opportunity; Article 27 reads as under:- No citizen otherwise qualified for appointment in the service of Pakistan shall be discriminated against in respect of any such appointment on the ground only of race, religion, caste, sex, residence or place of birth ....... Under the Principles of Policy, it is further emphasized in Article 34 of the Constitution that:- Steps shall be taken to ensure full participation of women in all spheres of national life. The Constitution commands the Government to take meaningful and effective steps and formulate policies conducive to tap this most important human resource by ensuring congenial working environments, free from harassment or discrimination so as to facilitate female participation in the national life for a better and Civil Appeal No.797 of 2013 4 prosperous future. These cherished goals envisaged by the Supreme Law cannot be set at naught through policies inherently flawed as well as discriminatory. A policy manifestly inconsistent with the Constitutional commands, retrogressive in nature, and discriminatory inter se the populace is not immune from judicial review.

This appeal as of right assails the impugned judgment\ndated 14t» October 2013 of the learned Single Judge of the Peshawar High\nCourt, Abbottabad Bench, who allowed the civil revision filed by the\nrespondent and set aside the two concurrent judgments of the Subordinate\n\nCourts.\n\n2. The respondent had filed a suit seeking pre-emption of agricultural\nland situated in Mouza Mankarai, District Haripur, which land the\nappellant had purchased through sale deed dated 25t January 2003 for a\nsale consideration of two hundred thousand rupees. In the plaint the pre-\nemptor plaintiff (the respondent herein) alleged that the actual sale\nconsideration was thirty one thousand rupees. The pre-emptor stated that\nhe learnt of the said sale on 6th March 2003 from Zafar Iqbal (PW-7) and\nimmediately made Talb-i-Muwathibat and thereafter issued notice of Talb-i-\n\nIshhad on 17‘ March 2003 which was received by the appellant.\n\n3. Mr. Ashfaq Qayyum Cheema, the learned counsel representing the\n\npurchaser of the land (the appellant herein, who was the defendant in the\n\nCivil Appeal No. 1409 of 2013 2\n\nsuit), did not dispute that the respondent had the right of pre-emption but\nstated that the Talb-i-Muwathibat was either not made or was not made\nimmediately and that Talb-i-Ishhad notice was not issued within two weeks\nthereof in terms of section 13 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Pre-Emption Act,\n1987 (“the Act”). He further stated that the notice of Talb-i-Ishhad was not\nreceived by the appellant as she was in France when Muhammad Aslam,\nthe postman (PW-3), came to deliver it and that the delivery of the notice to\nGhulam Akbar (DW-1) cannot be deemed to be receipt by the appellant of\nthe notice; reliance in this regard was placed upon the cases of Bashir\nAhmed v Ghulam Rasool (2011 SCMR 762), Khan Afsar v Afsar Khan (2015\nSCMR 311) and Basharat Ali Khan v Muhammad Akbar (2017 SCMR 309).\nThe learned counsel further stated that the purported informant Zafar Iqbal\n(PW-7) had testified that he had informed the respondent about the sale\noutside the door of the respondent’s residence whereas the respondent said\nthat he had received the said information from the informant in his\ncourtyard, which discrepancy, according to the learned counsel, is fatal and\nhe relied on the case of Allah Ditta v Muhammad Anar (2013 SCMR 866). He\nfurther stated that the respondent was not interested to purchase the said\nland at the price paid for it by the appellant as he, without any basis,\nalleged that the land was bought for thirty one thousand rupees instead of\ntwo hundred thousand rupees. Concluding his submissions the learned\ncounsel stated that the pre-emption suit had been dismissed and the appeal\nfiled by the respondent was also dismissed and there was no justification to\nset aside the two concurrent judgments of the Subordinate Courts in\nexercise of the High Court’s revisional jurisdiction as there was no illegality\nor material irregularity in the judgments impugned before the High Court in\n\nterms of Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\n\n4. Sardar Muhammad Aslam, the learned counsel representing the pre-\nemptor respondent, stated that the learned counsel for the appellant has\nargued the matter beyond the point noted in order dated 15th May 2018 of\nthis Court, which was limited to the point with regard to the service of\nnotice of Talb-i-Ishhad which he cannot do. With regard to service of Talb-i-\nIshhad notice on Ghulam Akbar (DW-1) the learned counsel stated that\nGhulam Akbar was the authorized attorney of the appellant and had\nreceived the notice on her behalf, therefore, the notice had been properly\n\nserved on the appellant. The learned counsel further stated that if Ghulam\n\nCivil Appeal No. 1409 of 2013 3\n\nAkbar was not authorized to receive notice he should not have received it.\nThe said land was also bought by the appellant through her attorney\nGhulam Akbar, therefore, according to the learned counsel service of the\nsaid notice on Ghulam Akbar was proper even on this score; reliance was\nalso placed on the case of Pervaiz v Muhammad Nawaz (2006 SCMR 4). In\nrespect of the evidence referred to by the appellant’s counsel with regard to\nwhen the respondent gained knowledge of the sale the learned counsel\nstated that a particular sentence or two from the testimony of the\nrespondent and Zafar Iqbal should not be read in isolation and that the\nsame should be read in context with their entire testimonies and in this\nregard relied upon the case of Muhammad Amir v Khan Bahadur (PLD 1996\nSupreme Court 267).\n\n5. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and with their able\nassistance also examined the documents on record. With regard to the\nobjection taken by the respondent’s learned counsel, that the appellant’s\ncounsel cannot argue the matter beyond the scope of the order dated 15th\nMay 2018, which had only referred to the matter of service of the notice of\nTalb-i-Ishhad we regrettably cannot bring ourselves to agree with the learned\ncounsel since this appeal has been filed as of right, as two concurrent\njudgments were set aside in revision, and the appeal has not arisen out of a\n\npetition for leave to appeal.\n\n6. The referred to section 13 of the Act commences by stating that, “the\nright of pre-emption of a person shall be extinguished unless such person\nmakes demands of pre-emption in the following order, namely: (a) Talb-i-\nMuwathibat; (b) Talb-i-Ishhad; and (c) Talb-i-Khusumat’ and goes on to\nexplain, that, “Talb-i-Muwathibat means immediate demand by a pre-emptor\nin the sitting or meeting (Majlis) in which he has come to know of the sale\ndeclaring his intention to exercise the right of pre-emption’. And, subsection\n(2) of section 13 of the Act states that, “when the fact of sale comes within\nthe knowledge of a pre-emptor through any source, he shall make Talb-i-\nMuwathibat’ whereafter the pre-emptor has to issue notice of Talb-i-Ishhad\nwithin two weeks (subsection (3) of section 13 of the Act). In this case the\nnotice of Talb-i-Ishhad was issued on 17‘ March 2003. The two weeks’ time\nwithin which the notice of Talb-i-Ishhad had to be issued will start to run\n\nfrom the time when the pre-emptor got knowledge of the sale. The pre-\n\nCivil Appeal No. 1409 of 2013 4\n\nemptor respondent (PW-6) stated that his real nephew Zafar Iqbal (PW-7)\nlearnt of the sale on the day of the execution of the sale deed, which was\n25th January 2003, however, Zafar Iqbal stated that respondent was\ninformed by him on 6tt March 2003. In his cross-examination Zafar Iqbal\nstated that he did not know the name of the purchaser and also did not\nknow the particulars of the land which had been purchased. It is thus clear\nthat the respondent had not learnt of the said sale on 6t March 2003 as\nwas stated by him in the plaint. The respondent in his cross-examination\nadmitted that his nephew learnt of the sale on the date of execution of sale\ndeed, which was 25th January 2003, therefore, it can reasonably be\npresumed that Zafar Iqbal must have informed his uncle then or soon\nthereafter instead of waiting for forty-one days. The respondent pleaded and\ntestified that Talb-i-Muwathibat was made on 6th March 2003 which is not\nbelievable, particularly, when Zafar Iqbal testified that the only reason for\nhim to go and see to his uncle on 6 March 2003 was to inform him about\nthe sale, thereby suggesting that he had considered the communication of\ninformation of sale as important. In the plaint it was disclosed that Zafar\nIqbal had learnt of the sale on 25tt January 2003. It thus appears that the\nrespondent had knowledge of the sale on 25th January 2003 but to bring the\nnotice of Talb-i-Ishhad within the statutory period of two weeks had alleged\nin the plaint that he learnt of it on 6t March 2003. In a pre-emption suit\nthe pre-emptor must immediately upon learning of the sale make Talb-i-\nMuwathibat and thereafter as per the Act, within fourteen days, send notice\nof Talb-i-Ishhad. Since the knowledge of sale was obtained by the\nrespondent on 25th January 2003, or soon thereafter, the notice of Talb-i-\n\nIshhad was sent beyond the statutory period of two weeks.\n\n7. Since in our opinion the respondent did not make Talb-i-Muwathibat\nimmediately and also did not send the notice of Talb-i-Ishhad within the\nprescribed period of two weeks the respondent’s pre-emption suit would fail\non these grounds. It is therefore not necessary to determine the matter of\nwhether service on the appellant’s attorney was proper service of the notice\n\nof Talb-i-Ishhad.\n\n8. There is however another matter which in our opinion needs to be\ncommented upon. The respondent in his plaint had stated that the land was\n\nbought for thirty one thousand rupees however he did not substantiate his\n\nCivil Appeal No. 1409 of 2013 5\n\nassertion with regard to its alleged sale price. Section 33 of the Act\n\nstipulates as under:\n\n“33. Matters ancillary or akin to the provisions of this Act.\nMatters ancillary or akin to the provisions of this Act which have\nnot been specifically covered under any provision thereof shall be\ndecided according to Shariah.”\n\nIn the case of Subhanuddin v Pir Ghulam (PLD 2015 Supreme\nCourt 69) it was held, that:\n\n“Shari’ah requires honesty and truthfulness in one’s dealing and\nfalse statements made to obtain an advantage is an anthema to\nAlmighty Allah: “O, you who believe! Be afraid of Allah, and be with\nthose who are true” (Surah 9, At-Taubah, verse 119); “And be not\nlike her who undoes the thread which she has spun after it has\nbecome strong, by taking your oaths a means of deception amongst\nyourselves” (Surah 16, An-Nahl, verse 92); “And make not your\noaths, a means of deception among yourselves, lest a foot may slip\nafter being firmly planted, and you may have to taste the evil of\nhaving hindered from the Path of Allah and yours will be a great\ntorment’ (Surah 16, An-Nahl, verse 94). Therefore, when an undue\nadvantage is sought to be gained on the basis of a completely\nunsubstantiated statement it would disentitle a shafee to claim\npre-emption. This was not a case where the plaintiff had been\nunable to establish the price that he contended was paid for the\nsaid land, but instead a case where a plea which had no basis in\nfact was taken to gain an advantage.”\n\n9. Therefore, for the reasons mentioned above, we allow this appeal,\nset aside the impugned judgment of the High Court and consequently\ndismiss the pre-emption suit filed by the respondent, but with no order\n\nas to costs.\n\nJudge\n\nJudge\nAnnounced in open Court at Islamabad on 14t January, 2020.\n\nJudge\n\nBench-IV\n\nApproved for Reporting\n(M.

With regard to the objection taken by the respondent s learned counsel, that the appellant s counsel cannot argue the matter beyond the scope of the order dated 15th May 2018, which had only referred to the matter of service of the notice of Talb-i-Ishhad we regrettably cannot bring ourselves to agree with the learned counsel since this appeal has been filed as of right, as two concurrent judgments were set aside in revision, and the appeal has not arisen out of a petition for leave to appeal. 6.

And, subsection 2 of section 13 of the Act states that, when the fact of sale comes within the knowledge of a pre-emptor through any source, he shall make Talb-iMuwathibat whereafter the pre-emptor has to issue notice of Talb-i-Ishhad within two weeks subsection 3 of section 13 of the Act . In this case the notice of Talb-i-Ishhad was issued on 17 March 2003. The two weeks time within which the notice of Talb-i-Ishhad had to be issued will start to run from the time when the pre-emptor got knowledge of the sale. The preCivil Appeal No. 1409 of 2013 4 emptor respondent PW-6 stated that his real nephew Zafar Iqbal PW-7 learnt of the sale on the day of the execution of the sale deed, which was 25th January 2003, however, Zafar Iqbal stated that respondent was informed by him on 6tt March 2003. In his cross-examination Zafar Iqbal stated that he did not know the name of the purchaser and also did not know the particulars of the land which had been purchased. It is thus clear that the respondent had not learnt of the said sale on 6t March 2003 as was stated by him in the plaint.

It thus appears that the respondent had knowledge of the sale on 25th January 2003 but to bring the notice of Talb-i-Ishhad within the statutory period of two weeks had alleged in the plaint that he learnt of it on 6t March 2003. In a pre-emption suit the pre-emptor must immediately upon learning of the sale make Talb-iMuwathibat and thereafter as per the Act, within fourteen days, send notice of Talb-i-Ishhad. Since the knowledge of sale was obtained by the respondent on 25th January 2003, or soon thereafter, the notice of Talb-iIshhad was sent beyond the statutory period of two weeks. 7. Since in our opinion the respondent did not make Talb-i-Muwathibat immediately and also did not send the notice of Talb-i-Ishhad within the prescribed period of two weeks the respondent s pre-emption suit would fail on these grounds. It is therefore not necessary to determine the matter of whether service on the appellant s attorney was proper service of the notice of Talb-i-Ishhad. 8. There is however another matter which in our opinion needs to be commented upon. The respondent in his plaint had stated that the land was bought for thirty one thousand rupees however he did not substantiate his Civil Appeal No. 1409 of 2013 5 assertion with regard to its alleged sale price. Section 33 of the Act stipulates as under: 33. Matters ancillary or akin to the provisions of this Act. Matters ancillary or akin to the provisions of this Act which have not been specifically covered under any provision thereof shall be decided according to Shariah. In the case of Subhanuddin v Pir Ghulam PLD 2015 Supreme Court 69 it was held, that: Shari ah requires honesty and truthfulness in one s dealing and false statements made to obtain an advantage is an anthema to Almighty Allah: O, you who believe! Be afraid of Allah, and be with those who are true Surah 9, At-Taubah, verse 119 ; And be not like her who undoes the thread which she has spun after it has become strong, by taking your oaths a means of deception amongst yourselves Surah 16, An-Nahl, verse 92 ; And make not your oaths, a means of deception among yourselves, lest a foot may slip after being firmly planted, and you may have to taste the evil of having hindered from the Path of Allah and yours will be a great torment Surah 16, An-Nahl, verse 94 . Therefore, when an undue advantage is sought to be gained on the basis of a completely unsubstantiated statement it would disentitle a shafee to claim pre-emption. This was not a case where the plaintiff had been unable to establish the price that he contended was paid for the said land, but instead a case where a plea which had no basis in fact was taken to gain an advantage. 9. Therefore, for the reasons mentioned above, we allow this appeal, set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court and consequently dismiss the pre-emption suit filed by the respondent, but with no order as to costs.

Tauseef", "Sentences": ["This appeal as of right assails the impugned judgment dated 14t October 2013 of the learned Single Judge of the Peshawar High Court, Abbottabad Bench, who allowed the civil revision filed by the respondent and set aside the two concurrent judgments of the Subordinate Courts.", "The respondent had filed a suit seeking pre-emption of agricultural land situated in Mouza Mankarai, District Haripur, which land the appellant had purchased through sale deed dated 25t January 2003 for a sale consideration of two hundred thousand rupees.", "In the plaint the preemptor plaintiff the respondent herein alleged that the actual sale consideration was thirty one thousand rupees.", "The pre-emptor stated that he learnt of the said sale on 6th March 2003 from Zafar Iqbal PW-7 and immediately made Talb-i-Muwathibat and thereafter issued notice of Talb-iIshhad on 17 March 2003 which was received by the appellant.", "Mr. Ashfaq Qayyum Cheema, the learned counsel representing the purchaser of the land the appellant herein, who was the defendant in the Civil Appeal No. 1409 of 2013 2 suit , did not dispute that the respondent had the right of pre-emption but stated that the Talb-i-Muwathibat was either not made or was not made immediately and that Talb-i-Ishhad notice was not issued within two weeks thereof in terms of section 13 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Pre-Emption Act, 1987 the Act .", "He further stated that the notice of Talb-i-Ishhad was not received by the appellant as she was in France when Muhammad Aslam, the postman PW-3 , came to deliver it and that the delivery of the notice to Ghulam Akbar DW-1 cannot be deemed to be receipt by the appellant of the notice; reliance in this regard was placed upon the cases of Bashir Ahmed v Ghulam Rasool 2011 SCMR 762 , Khan Afsar v Afsar Khan 2015 SCMR 311 and Basharat Ali Khan v Muhammad Akbar 2017 SCMR 309 .", "The learned counsel further stated that the purported informant Zafar Iqbal PW-7 had testified that he had informed the respondent about the sale outside the door of the respondent s residence whereas the respondent said that he had received the said information from the informant in his courtyard, which discrepancy, according to the learned counsel, is fatal and he relied on the case of Allah Ditta v Muhammad Anar 2013 SCMR 866 .", "He further stated that the respondent was not interested to purchase the said land at the price paid for it by the appellant as he, without any basis, alleged that the land was bought for thirty one thousand rupees instead of two hundred thousand rupees.", "Concluding his submissions the learned counsel stated that the pre-emption suit had been dismissed and the appeal filed by the respondent was also dismissed and there was no justification to set aside the two concurrent judgments of the Subordinate Courts in exercise of the High Court s revisional jurisdiction as there was no illegality or material irregularity in the judgments impugned before the High Court in terms of Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure.", "Sardar Muhammad Aslam, the learned counsel representing the preemptor respondent, stated that the learned counsel for the appellant has argued the matter beyond the point noted in order dated 15th May 2018 of this Court, which was limited to the point with regard to the service of notice of Talb-i-Ishhad which he cannot do.", "With regard to service of Talb-iIshhad notice on Ghulam Akbar DW-1 the learned counsel stated that Ghulam Akbar was the authorized attorney of the appellant and had received the notice on her behalf, therefore, the notice had been properly served on the appellant.", "The learned counsel further stated that if Ghulam Civil Appeal No. 1409 of 2013 3 Akbar was not authorized to receive notice he should not have received it.", "The said land was also bought by the appellant through her attorney Ghulam Akbar, therefore, according to the learned counsel service of the said notice on Ghulam Akbar was proper even on this score; reliance was also placed on the case of Pervaiz v Muhammad Nawaz 2006 SCMR 4 .", "In respect of the evidence referred to by the appellant s counsel with regard to when the respondent gained knowledge of the sale the learned counsel stated that a particular sentence or two from the testimony of the respondent and Zafar Iqbal should not be read in isolation and that the same should be read in context with their entire testimonies and in this regard relied upon the case of Muhammad Amir v Khan Bahadur PLD 1996 Supreme Court 267 .", "We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and with their able assistance also examined the documents on record.", "With regard to the objection taken by the respondent s learned counsel, that the appellant s counsel cannot argue the matter beyond the scope of the order dated 15th May 2018, which had only referred to the matter of service of the notice of Talb-i-Ishhad we regrettably cannot bring ourselves to agree with the learned counsel since this appeal has been filed as of right, as two concurrent judgments were set aside in revision, and the appeal has not arisen out of a petition for leave to appeal.", "The referred to section 13 of the Act commences by stating that, the right of pre-emption of a person shall be extinguished unless such person makes demands of pre-emption in the following order, namely: a Talb-iMuwathibat; b Talb-i-Ishhad; and c Talb-i-Khusumat and goes on to explain, that, Talb-i-Muwathibat means immediate demand by a pre-emptor in the sitting or meeting Majlis in which he has come to know of the sale declaring his intention to exercise the right of pre-emption .", "And, subsection 2 of section 13 of the Act states that, when the fact of sale comes within the knowledge of a pre-emptor through any source, he shall make Talb-iMuwathibat whereafter the pre-emptor has to issue notice of Talb-i-Ishhad within two weeks subsection 3 of section 13 of the Act .", "In this case the notice of Talb-i-Ishhad was issued on 17 March 2003.", "The two weeks time within which the notice of Talb-i-Ishhad had to be issued will start to run from the time when the pre-emptor got knowledge of the sale.", "The preCivil Appeal No. 1409 of 2013 4 emptor respondent PW-6 stated that his real nephew Zafar Iqbal PW-7 learnt of the sale on the day of the execution of the sale deed, which was 25th January 2003, however, Zafar Iqbal stated that respondent was informed by him on 6tt March 2003.", "In his cross-examination Zafar Iqbal stated that he did not know the name of the purchaser and also did not know the particulars of the land which had been purchased.", "It is thus clear that the respondent had not learnt of the said sale on 6t March 2003 as was stated by him in the plaint.", "The respondent in his cross-examination admitted that his nephew learnt of the sale on the date of execution of sale deed, which was 25th January 2003, therefore, it can reasonably be presumed that Zafar Iqbal must have informed his uncle then or soon thereafter instead of waiting for forty-one days.", "The respondent pleaded and testified that Talb-i-Muwathibat was made on 6th March 2003 which is not believable, particularly, when Zafar Iqbal testified that the only reason for him to go and see to his uncle on 6 March 2003 was to inform him about the sale, thereby suggesting that he had considered the communication of information of sale as important.", "In the plaint it was disclosed that Zafar Iqbal had learnt of the sale on 25tt January 2003.", "It thus appears that the respondent had knowledge of the sale on 25th January 2003 but to bring the notice of Talb-i-Ishhad within the statutory period of two weeks had alleged in the plaint that he learnt of it on 6t March 2003.", "In a pre-emption suit the pre-emptor must immediately upon learning of the sale make Talb-iMuwathibat and thereafter as per the Act, within fourteen days, send notice of Talb-i-Ishhad.", "Since the knowledge of sale was obtained by the respondent on 25th January 2003, or soon thereafter, the notice of Talb-iIshhad was sent beyond the statutory period of two weeks.", "Since in our opinion the respondent did not make Talb-i-Muwathibat immediately and also did not send the notice of Talb-i-Ishhad within the prescribed period of two weeks the respondent s pre-emption suit would fail on these grounds.", "It is therefore not necessary to determine the matter of whether service on the appellant s attorney was proper service of the notice of Talb-i-Ishhad.", "There is however another matter which in our opinion needs to be commented upon.", "The respondent in his plaint had stated that the land was bought for thirty one thousand rupees however he did not substantiate his Civil Appeal No. 1409 of 2013 5 assertion with regard to its alleged sale price.", "Section 33 of the Act stipulates as under: 33.", "Matters ancillary or akin to the provisions of this Act.", "Matters ancillary or akin to the provisions of this Act which have not been specifically covered under any provision thereof shall be decided according to Shariah.", "In the case of Subhanuddin v Pir Ghulam PLD 2015 Supreme Court 69 it was held, that: Shari ah requires honesty and truthfulness in one s dealing and false statements made to obtain an advantage is an anthema to Almighty Allah: O, you who believe!", "Be afraid of Allah, and be with those who are true Surah 9, At-Taubah, verse 119 ;

Ahsan ud Din, ASC\nCh. Akhtar Ali, AOR\n\nFor the Respondent-4 : Sh. Azmat Ali Bukhari, ASC\nDate of Hearing >: 26.11.2019\nJudgment\n\nSajjad Ali Shah, J. Briefly, the respondent Firdos Khan on 1*t\n\nNovember, 1999 entered into an agreement to purchase six marlas of land\nsituated in Kamilpur Syedan Tehsil and District Attock from one Abdul\nRehman. The agreement neither provided the description of land by metes\nand bounds nor identified it through specifying Khasra numbers, khewat\nnumbers etc. The agreement even did not mention the sale consideration\nagreed between the parties but only narrated that an advance of Rs.50000/-\nwas paid to the said Abdul Rehman. It appears that this agreement could\nnot be materialized and consequently the respondent Firdos Khan, on\n28.2.2000, filed a suit seeking specific performance of the stated agreement\nbut somehow the other he, on his own, described in the plaint Khewat No.\n255, Khasra Nos. 853, 854 & 855. That on being summoned, Abdul Rehman\n\nfiled his written statement wherein he has categorically stated that since\n\nCA 383 of 2013 2\n\nFirdos Khan had failed to pay the balance sale consideration in terms of the\nagreement, therefore, he has sold his land and confiscated the advance in\nterms of the agreement.\n\n2. Firdos Khan adduced evidence in support of his claim his\nwitnesses were cross examined and it was suggested that the price was\norally agreed at Rs.50,000/- per marla and Abdul Rehman repeatedly asked\nFirdos Khan to pay the balance sale consideration of Rs.250,000/- and get\nthe sale deed executed in his favour but Firdos Khan avoided as he had no\nmoney. The defendant Abdul Rehman had no interest in the lis as he had\nalready sold the land, therefore, he choose not to appear in the witness box\nand consequently the suit was decreed on 1.6.2001. It is very interesting\nthat neither the agreement nor the plaint stated the total sale price but the\nCourt on its own determined the total sale price as Rs.78,000/- i.e.\nRs.13000/- Per Marla.\n\n3. On the other hand, the record reflects that on 1.3.2000 the\npresent appellant Muhammad Miskeen purchased six marlas of land bearing\nKhewat No. 198/326, Khasra Nos. 851 & 852 and Khewat No. 255, Khasra\nNos. 854 & 855 situated in the revenue estate of Kamilpur Syedan Tehsil\nand District Attock through registered sale deed dated 1.3.2000 carrying\nmutation No.3200 from Mst. Razia Begum and Mst. Shabana who happened\nto be the real mother and sister of said Abdul Rehman. The possession of\nland was handed over to the present appellant Muhammad Miskeen who on\n9.7.2001 got the construction plan sanctioned from Municipal Corporation\nAttock and excavated a well, raised boundary wall and installed gate\nthereon.\n\n4. It appears that on 4.9.2001 respondent Firdos Khan, after\ndepositing Rs.28000/- (the balance sale price in terms of decree) in\ngovernment treasury, initiated execution proceedings, seeking execution of\nthe conveyance deed. This was the first time appellant Muhammad Miskeen\n\nentered appearance in Court and on 8.10.2001 filed objections to the\n\nCA 383 of 2013 3\n\nexecution proceedings in which he categorically disclosed that the subject\nproperty was owned by Mst. Razia Sultana and Shabana Bibi from whom he\nhas purchased on 1.3.2000 through a registered conveyance deed. The trial\nCourt vide its order dated 12.4.2002 dismissed the objection on the ground\nthat the suit was filed on 28 February, 2000 and the conveyance deed was\nexecuted in favour of objector on 1.3.2000, therefore, the transaction was hit\nby principle of lis pendens.\n5. The appellant Muhammad Miskeen filed an appeal against the\nsaid order and the learned Additional District Judge Attock vide its order\ndated 11.7.2002 set-aside the said impugned order of Civil Judge by holding\nthat principle of lis pendens is inapplicable and directed to decide the\napplication after framing of issues and recording of evidence. The trial Court\nafter recording evidence of both the sides again vide its order dated\n18.10.2006 dismissed the objection petition. The appellant again filed an\nappeal and the learned Additional District Judge vide its order dated\n30.1.2008 this time dismissed the appeal on the ground that the appropriate\nremedy for the appellant was to file an application under section 12(2) CPC.\n6. Soon after dismissal of the appeal, the executing Court issued\na writ of possession in respect of the subject property in favour of Firdos\nKhan and consequently the Bailiff, on 4t February, 2008, in presence of\nAbdul Rehman handed over the peaceful vacant possession of the subject\nplot to Firdos Khan.\n7. The appellant Muhammad Miskeen, in consequence to the\nobservations of the Additional District Judge, on 26.2.2008 moved an\napplication under Section 12(2) CPC. The Court framed issues on 26.7.2008\nand thereafter two witnesses were examined one from Building Department\nof TMA Attock who produced the plan which was got approved by\nMuhammad Miskeen appellant for the construction of his house on the\nsubject property whereas the other witness Razia Begum stated that her\n\nearlier statement recorded on the application resisting the execution may be\n\nCA 383 of 2013 4\n\ntreated as her statement. It appears that thereafter on 27.1.2010 the\nrespondent Firdos Khan moved an application seeking rejection of\napplication under Section 12(2) CPC on the ground that it was barred by\ntime and the Court after hearing the parties vide its order dated 25.2.2010\nrejected the application by holding the application to be barred by time. The\nappellant thereafter filed a revision petition before the learned District Judge\nwho vide its order dated 3.5.2011 dismissed the same by affirming the view\nof the Civil Judge. The appellant thereafter approached the Lahore High\nCourt by invoking its writ jurisdiction and the High Court too, vide its\nimpugned order, maintained the concurrent findings that the application\nunder Section 12(2) CPC was barred by time.\n\n8. Leave was granted by this Court on 9.10.2017 in terms of order\ndated 7.9.2011 to examine that since the appellant, who had purchased the\nsubject property through registered sale deed, had been diligently pursuing\nhis remedy and thus as to whether his application under Section 12(2) CPC\ncould have been dismissed on the ground of limitation. We, while hearing\nthis appeal, on 20.11.2019 added the following additional points in the leave\ngranting order not only to put the counsel on notice of the points which\nduring their submission had come to our attention but to solicit their\nassistance:-\n\ni) Whether the agreement of sale deed dated 11‘ April,\n1999, which did not mention the particulars of the\nproperty and consideration, is compliant with section\n29 of the Contract Act, 1872;\n\nii) Whether the plaint complied with the provisions of\nOrder VII Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure; and\n\ntii) The consequences in respect of error or mistake\n\ncommitted by a court”.\n\n9. Counsel for the appellant contended that since the sale\nagreement neither provided the description of the property nor the sale\n\nconsideration, therefore, it was void and could not have been enforced\n\nCA 383 of 2013 5\n\nthrough a suit for specific performance. It was next contended that the\nexecuting Court without determining the title/entitlement of Abdul Rehman\nto sell and without giving finding on the registered conveyance deed in\nfavour of the appellant Muhammad Miskeen, could not have executed the\ndecree by issuance of writ of possession as Abdul Rehman was not the\nowner of the property. It was further contended that the appellant has\nsuffered on account of the mistake committed by the Court by enforcing a\nvoid agreement which needed to be corrected. It was lastly contended that\nthe plaint did not specify the subject property by metes and bounds in terms\nof Order VII Rule 3 CPC, therefore, was in-executable in itself but the Court\nwithout there being anything on record dispossessed the appellant and\nhanded over the possession of his property to respondent Firdos Khan.\n\n10. On the other hand, counsel for responded Firdos Khan fairly\nand frankly conceded that the agreement of sale neither specifies khasra\nnumbers or khewat numbers etc. nor describe the property by metes and\nbounds. He also admits that there was no sale consideration fixed but\ncontends that since this dispute has already been adjudicated rightly or\nwrongly and this Court has only to consider as to whether the application\nunder Section 12(2) CPC was rightly dismissed on account of being barred\nby time or not. However, he further states his no objection for condoning the\ndelay in filing application under Section 12(2) CPC and submits that the trial\nCourt may be directed to record the evidence on the appellant’s application\nunder section 12(2) CPC and then to pass appropriate orders in accordance\nwith law.\n\n11. We have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the\nrespective parties and have minutely perused the record.\n\n12. Section 22 of the Specific Relief Act clearly lays down that the\njurisdiction to decree a suit for specific performance is purely discretionary\nand the Court is not bound to grant such relief merely because its lawful to\n\ndo so and further that such discretion of the Court is not arbitrary but is\n\nCA 383 of 2013 6\n\nbased on sound and reasonable judicial principles. In our opinion the\nCourts below have totally ignored the law on the subject while decreeing the\nsuit on the basis of an agreement which neither specified the property under\nsale by metes and bounds nor provided for the sale consideration. The\nagreement merely states that a sum of Rs.50,000/- was paid in advance\ntowards an unspecified sale price in respect of six marlas of land situated in\nKamilpur Syedan Tehsil and District Attock without specifying Khasra\nnumbers, khewat numbers etc. The plaint filed by the respondent Firdos\nKhan though has prescribed the khasra numbers (without any supporting\ndocumentary evidence showing the ownership of the seller in respect of land\nclaimed) but is totally silent regarding the agreed sale consideration. The\ntrial Court without framing any issue to find out the veracity of the plaintiff's\nclaim regarding the claimed land or the title of the seller believed the\nstatement of plaintiff/respondent No.1 and decreed the suit. The other\nfailure on the part of the trial Court was to fix the total sale price of the plot\non its own ignoring the fact that neither the agreement nor the plaint\nprescribed the sale price. The trial Court allowed the plaintiff/respondent\nFirdos Khan to build a case which was even not pleaded in the plaint. The\nCourt even did not feel it necessary to frame an issue to find out the sale\nprice and placed reliance on totally extraneous documents. In these\ncircumstances, the trial Court ought to have given convincing reasons for\ndecreeing the suit by allowing specific performance and for ignoring all the\ndeficiencies in the agreement as well as in the plaint specially when the relief\nwas discretionary.\n\n13. The other important fact which was not taken care by the trial\nCourt or the respondent Firdos Khan was that Abdul Rehman in his written\nstatement had clearly mentioned that he had sold the subject property\ndespite no efforts were made to implead the purchaser before decreeing the\n\nsuit.\n\nCA 383 of 2013 7\n\n14. The matter does not end here. It appears that when the\nrespondent Firdos Khan filed execution application on 4.9.2001, the\nappellant Muhammad Miskeen filed objections which in the first round were\ndismissed on the ground of lis pendens and on remand by the appellate\nCourt to decide the objection after framing issues. It appear that the Court\nthereafter framed issues and allowed the parties to lead evidence and even\none of the issues was:-\n“Whether decree has not passed by fraud and collusion”\n\n15. Thereafter the objection petition was dismissed and in appeal\nthe appellate Court without looking into this aspect that the trial Court has\nalready allowed the parties to adduce evidence and giving his finding on this\nparticular issue, rejected the appeal by making an observation that the\nproper remedy was to file an application under section 12(2) ignoring the\nfact that the trial as well as the executing Court were one and the same. The\nappellant Muhammad Miskeen, thereafter filed another application under\nSection 12(2) CPC which till the High Court was dismissed being barred by\ntime. Though Mr. Sheikh has conceded that the delay in filing of application\nunder section 12(2) could be condoned and the matter may be remanded to\nthe trial Court so that the parties could adduce evidence. However, we have\nfound that such plea of fraud and misrepresentation was taken in the first\napplication on which an issue was framed regarding fraud and\nmisrepresentation and thereafter parties were allowed to lead evidence.\nTherefore, it would be totally unfair to again throw the parties at the mercy\nof litigation for another 20 years as the present round of litigation has\nalmost consumed two decades.\n\n16. We have also found from the record that on first objection\npetition, not only a challenge to decree on the ground of fraud was thrown\nbut as observed a specific issue, to this effect, was framed. Appellant\nMuhammad Miskeen had appeared in the witness box, he was cross-\n\nexamined by the counsel for respondent Firdos Khan and _ thereafter\n\nCA 383 of 2013 8\n\nrespondent Firdos Khan appeared, adduced his evidence and was cross-\nexamined by counsel of appellant Muhammad Miskeen. Firdos Khan further\nproduced Shabana Begum, Razia Begum and one Muhammad Safdar\nQureshi as his witnesses and were duly cross examined and interestingly\nthe trial as well as the executing Court were the same.\n17. We note with great concern that though both applications filed\nby the appellant first before the executing Court objecting the execution of\ndecree against his property and second before the trial Court under section\n12(2) CPC challenging the decree by pleading fraud, misrepresentation and\nlack of jurisdiction, were competently filed and were wrongly dismissed. The\nfirst application was competent for the reason that the appellant had placed\ntitle documents before the executing Court in respect of Khewat No.198\n(326), Khasra Nos. 851 and 852 which did not form part of the decree and,\ntherefore, could have been validly objected to under Order XXI Rule 58 or\nunder other provisions of Code of Civil Procedure whereas the second\napplication under Section 12(2) was also competent as the respondent\nMiskeen had obtained a decree in respect of Khewat No.255, Khasra Nos.\n854, 855 for which the appellant was holding registered conveyance deed\nand unless such conveyance deed would have been cancelled, no fresh\ndecree regarding ownership of the said property could not have been\npassed. We have noticed that the sole defendant namely, Abdul Rehman in\nhis written statement has disclosed the sale of the said property and it has\ncome in evidence subsequently in execution proceedings that the parties\nwere known to each other or there was a jirga, (the veracity whereas we\ncannot vouch) reflects that the respondent Firdos Khan was aware of the\nsale, therefore, he ought to have joined the appellant in the proceedings.\n18. Though it is a fit case where this Court could go beyond what\nwas appealed in order to do a complete justice between the parties, however,\nwhile exercising restraint, we would set-aside all orders passed on\n\nappellant’s application under Section 12(2) CPC as we have noticed that the\n\nCA 383 of 2013 9\n\nCourts below have not followed the rules or procedures provided in the Code\nof Civil Procedure by accepting stances and documents which did not form\npart of the pleadings and have conducted the proceedings as there are no\nrules which regulate the proceedings before the trial Court while exercising\nthe civil original jurisdiction. The objection to the decree as well as to the\nexecution proceedings would be deemed to be pending before both the\nCourts and the already recorded evidence as we have noticed in para 16\nabove would be valid for the purposes of both the proceedings as we have\nfound commonality in both the proceedings. None of the orders on record\nwould come in the way of trial as well as executing Court to adjudge the\ndispute but strictly on the basis of pleadings. However, the parties would be\nat liberty to adduce any fresh evidence in support of their pleadings and the\ntrial Court should ensure that the application under Section 12(2) CPC is\ndecided within 60 days and in case the judgment and decree could not be\nsustained then restitution of property in terms of Section 144 should also be\nconsidered. In case any of the Court is fell vacant, the District Judge would\nensure that the matter is transferred to the next nearest Court having the\njurisdiction to try the matter.\n\n19. The appeal is allowed in the above terms leaving the parties to\n\nbear their own costs.\n\nJudge\n\nIslamabad, the Judge\n\nAnnounced on 15.01.2020.\n\nA.

He was thereafter booked in FIR No.155 of the\nsame date registered at Police Station, City Gojra, District Toba\nTek Singh for offences punishable under section 302 P.P.C. After\nregular trial, he was convicted under section 302(c) PPC and\nsentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 10 years by the Trial\nCourt. Upon appeal by the complainant the High Court through\nimpugned judgment dated 26.02.2013 set-aside the judgment of\nthe trial court and convicted the appellant under section 302(b),\n\nPPC and sentenced him to imprisonment for life, thereby the\n\nCrl.A No.154-L/2013 etc. 2\n\ncriminal appeal of the complainant was allowed, whereas the\ncriminal appeal filed by the appellant seeking acquittal was\n\ndismissed.\n\n2. When this appeal came up for hearing before this\nCourt on 27.3.2014, it was pointed out that the heirs of the\ndeceased Rabia Khalil had entered into compromise with the\nappellant. Criminal Misc. Application No.512-L/2013 was placed\non the record in this regard, which was allowed and the appeal of\nthe appellant was partly accepted to the extent of Rabia Khalil and\nconviction of the appellant qua her murder was set aside, while the\nappeal to the extent of conviction qua the murder of Raheel Arif\n\nwas kept pending, which has come up for hearing before us today.\n\n3. Story of the prosecution is that the brother of the\ncomplainant, Muhammad Nawaz, was hospitalized due to a heart\ncondition at Bashir Clinic, Gojra Road, Gojra on 21.04.2006. The\nappellant, having close terms with Muhammad Nawaz and his\nfamily, regularly visited him at the clinic. At the end of one of his\nvisits to the clinic on 23.04.2006, the appellant, around 2:15 am,\nrequested Raheel Arif, nephew of the complainant, to walk him\nhome from the clinic. Around 3:00 am, the same night, the\ncomplainant, who was also at the clinic, went out to drop Hassan\nIftikhar (PW-12) and Adeel Arif (brother of Raheel Arif) home on his\nmotorbike. The complainant party on their way home and while\npassing by Mehdi Mohalah, heard a fire shot in a street and on\nhearing the same, turned and drove into that street and saw the\nappellant firing at Raheel Arif, who succumbed to his injuries and\ndied in the street. The crime report continues to state that\nthereafter the appellant went into the house and locked the door\nand more fire shots were heard from inside the house. According to\nprosecution the motive behind the murder was that the appellant\nsuspected that Raheel Arif had illicit relations with his sister Rabia\nKhalil.\n\nCrl.A No.154-L/2013 etc. 3\n\n4. The defence version, as per statement of the appellant\nrecorded under section 342 Cr.P.C, is that he murdered the\ndeceased and his sister due to grave and sudden provocation when\nhe saw his sister in a compromising position with the deceased, as\nhe returned home from medical clinic in the wee hours of the night\n\non 23.4.2006.\n\n5. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and\nhave examined the record and the judgments of the courts below.\nThe trial court disbelieved the presence of the eye-witnesses, the\ncomplainant, Ali Ahmad (PW-11) and Hassan Iftikhar (PW-12) at\nthe site of the occurrence after a careful appraisal of their\ntestimony, supported by cogent reasons. The High Court has not\nupset the said findings in the impugned judgment. Additionally, we\nfind that according to the prosecution the complainant (PW-11) set\nout on his motorbike to drop Hassan Iftikhar (PW-12) and Adeel\nArif (brother of the deceased Raheel Arif) at their respective homes.\nIn the cross-examination the eye-witnesses (PW-11 and PW-12)\nand Syed Kazim Hussin (PW-1), the draftsman who prepared the\nsite plan (Ex-PA), stated that the place of occurrence does not fall\non the way to their homes. The site plan (Ex-PA) does not even\nshow that the road to Samundari Road, Gulshan Colony or\nAbdullahpur (areas where residences of PW-12, Adeel Arif and PW-\n11 are situate) passes through the place of occurrence. According\nto the site plan the complainant party saw the occurrence from a\ndistance of 297 feet, in the dead of the night. There is a\ncontradiction between the statements of the two eye-witnesses\n(PW-11 & PW-12) regarding their distance from the site of\noccurrence, PW-12 categorically stated in his cross-examination\nthat he was present during the occurrence at a distance of 14/15\nfeet from the place of occurrence, while PW-11 supports the site\nplan which describes the distance to be 297 feet. This\ninconsistency between the statement of the two eye-witnesses\ncasts doubt on the case of the prosecution. The light of the\n\nmotorcycle and a private bulb installed in the doorway of the house\n\nCrl.A No.154-L/2013 etc. 4\n\nof the appellant is also suspect as neither the said bulb nor the\nmotorcycle was recovered. Adeel Arif, one of the three eye-\nwitnesses, being the real brother of the deceased and as a\nconsequence being the most aggrieved amongst them, was given\nup by the prosecution as being “unnecessary,” giving rise to an\nadverse inference regarding his presence at the scene of the crime.\nThe above analysis makes the presence of the eye-witnesses at the\n\ncrime scene doubtful, as concluded by the trial court.\n\n6. With the presence of the eye-witnesses doubtful at the\nscene of the crime, it is not safe to place reliance on the ocular\naccount. As a consequence, the medical evidence or the recovery of\nthe firearm from the appellant lends little support or corroboration,\nto the case of the prosecution. For the above reasons we are of the\nview that the prosecution failed to establish the culpability of the\n\nappellant, on the basis of its evidence.\n\n7. The High Court did not examine the case of the\nprosecution and appraise its evidence to find out whether the\nprosecution had succeeded to prove the charge against the\naccused but instead, examined only the defence plea by placing\nreliance on Article 121 of the Qanun-e-Shahdat Order, 1984\n(“QSO”) and held that the appellant had failed to prove his plea of\ngrave and sudden provocation as taken in his statement under\nsection 342 Cr.P.C and proceeded to convict him under section\n302(b) PPC for the offence of “honour killing”, as alleged by the\n\nprosecution.\n\nProcess of appraising evidence and scope of Article 121 of QSO\n\n8. In a criminal trial, it is now jurisprudentially well-\nentrenched, the proper course for the court is to first discuss and\nassess the prosecution evidence, particularly the reliability of the\neye-witnesses, in order to arrive at the conclusion as to whether or\nnot the prosecution has succeeded in proving the charge against\n\nthe accused on the basis of its evidence.! Burden is always on the\n\n1 See Ashiq Hussain v. State, PLD 1994 SC 879.\n\nCrl.A No.154-L/2013 etc. 5\n\nprosecution to prove its case and it is only when a prima facie case\nis made out against the accused sufficient to justify his conviction,\ndoes the burden shift upon the accused under Article 121 of the\nQSO, if he relies on any of the General Exceptions in the P.P.C or\nwithin any special exception or proviso contained in any other part\nof the PPC or in any law defining the offence charged.? If the\nprosecution fails to prove its case against the accused, the\nquestion of shifting of burden upon the accused does not arise as\nit becomes immaterial. Where the accused has taken a defence\nplea (like, self defence, provocation, accident, etc.) which relates to\nan essential ingredient of the offence charged, the court is to\nappraise the prosecution case and the defense version in\n\njuxtaposition to adjudicate the matter.\n\n9. The approach adopted by the High Court, in the\ninstant case, in examining the defence plea of grave and sudden\nprovocation in isolation from the prosecution evidence was\nincorrect. The High Court did not appraise the prosecution\nevidence at all and convicted the appellant, under section 302(b)\nPPC, on the basis of its finding that he had failed to establish his\ndefence plea of grave and sudden provocation. This approach of the\nHigh Court in coming to the conclusion of the culpability of the\nappellant was contrary to the law declared by the two larger\nbenches of this Court in the cases of Wali Muhammad? and Ashiq\nHussain.> In the cited cases this Court authoritatively declared\nthat the accused cannot be convicted on the ground that his\ndefense plea appears unconvincing. The prosecution is duty bound\nto prove its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt on\nthe basis of its own evidence and is not absolved of this duty even\n\nif the accused has taken a defence plea.\n\n2 See Shamoon v. State, 1995 SCMR 1377; Mushtaq Hussain v. State, 2011 SCMR 45,\n\ner Rahmat Hussain Jafferi, J.\n\nSee Safdar Ali v. Crown, PLD 1953 FC 93; Abdul Haque v. Sate, PLD 1996 SC 1; Mst.\nMumtaz Begum v. Ghulam Farid, 2003 SCMR 647; Lal Khan v. Crown, PLD 1952 Lah\n502; Ghulam Yousaf v. Crown, PLD 1953 Lah 213; State v. Balahari, PLD 1962 Dacca\n467\n4 Wali Muhammad v.

Reliance by the High Court on Feroze® is misplaced;\nbecause in Feroze the learned trial court convicted the accused,\nand the High Court affirmed it, on the basis of the evidence of the\nprosecution and not on failure of the accused to prove its defence\nplea and this Court maintained the decisions of the courts below\nby refusing leave to appeal. However, if Feroze creates an\nimpression that the prosecution evidence needs not to be\nappraised/examined in a case where the accused has taken a\ndefence plea, we strongly dispel the same and reinforce the\naforesaid view of the larger benches of this Court expressed in Wali\n\nMuhammad and Ashiq Hussain.\n\n11. Consistent jurisprudence has evolved over the years by\nseveral judgments of this Court, wherein the accused persons were\nacquitted by accepting their plea taken in statement under section\n342 Cr.P.C., of having acted in furtherance of self-defence, when\nthe prosecution had failed to prove its case against them. The\ncases of Mehrban,’ Najib Raza,’ Waris Khan,? Muhammad Aksar,}°\nFaiz!! and Sultan!2 may be referred in this regard. These cases do\nnot discuss Article 121, QSO!5 as the accused is not required to\nprove his plea of self-defense, on failure of the prosecution to prove\n\nits case.\n\nHonour killing vis-a-vis_grave & sudden provocation\n\n12. The High Court has also relied on Ameer'*, for holding\nthat the case is one of honour killing and not of grave and sudden\nprovocation, without fully appreciating the difference between the\ntwo. In case of honour killing the act of murder is well thought out,\ncalculated and pre-mediated, while in case of grave and sudden\n\nprovocation the act is committed on the spur of the moment\n\n© Feroze v. State, 2008 SCMR 696.\n\n7 Mehrban Shah v. State, 1969 SCMR 839.\n\n8 Najib Raza Rehmani v. State, PLD 1978 SC 200.\n° Waris Khan v. Ishtiaq, PLD 1986 SC 335.\n\n10 Muhammad Aksar v.

State, PLD 2006 SC 283.\n\nCrl.A No.154-L/2013 etc. 7\n\nwithout any pre-planning or deliberation!S. Family honour may be\nat the root of both the acts, still there is a difference between the\ntwo; in case of honour killing the act is pre-meditated and a\nplanned one, while in case of grave and sudden provocation the act\nis so sudden that it entails no prior deliberation or planning.\nReliance by the High Court on Ameer is misplaced as the murder\nin that case was a pre-meditated one. This glaring distinguishing\nfact has not been appreciated by the High Court. It is also\nimportant to shed some light on the meaning and scope of the\n\nexpression, “grave and sudden provocation.”\n\nMeaning and scope of grave and sudden provocation\n\n13. The expression “grave and sudden provocation” was\nused by the Legislature in Exception-1 to the erstwhile section 300\nof PPC as: “Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, whilst\ndeprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden\nprovocation, causes the death of the person who gave the\nprovocation.” It is clearly spelt out from the said provisions that\nthe provocation offered by the act of the victim must be so grave\nand sudden that it would deprive the offender of the power of self-\ncontrol. Provocation in law thus consists mainly of three elements:\n(1) the act of provocation, (2) the loss of self-control, and (3) the\nretaliation/reaction proportionate to the provocation. The\nrelationship of these elements to each other, particularly in point\nof time, is of the foremost importance to determine whether there\nwas time for passion to cool and reason to resume.!© The whole\ndoctrine relating to provocation depends on the fact that it causes,\nor may cause, a sudden and temporary loss of self-control,\nwhereby malice which is the formation of an intention to kill or to\ninflict grievous bodily harm, is negatived.!” The proportionality of\nthe reaction to the provocation is tested on the touchstone of the\n\nreaction expected from a reasonable person. What a reasonable\n\n15 see Muhammad Qasim v. State, PLD 2018 SC 840; Muhammad Ameer v. State, PLD\n2006 SC 283; Ali Muhammad v.

In his statement under section 342, Cr.P.C, the\nappellant stated that he murdered the deceased and his sister due\nto grave and sudden provocation when he saw Raheel Arif\ncommitting zina with his sister, as he returned home from the\nmedical clinic in the wee hours of the night on 23.4.2006. His\nstatement made under section 342 Cr.P.C is reproduced below, for\nready reference:\n\n“Statement of accused Ali Ahmed s/o Khalil Ahmed\ncaste Butt aged 30 years businessman r/o Mehdi\nMohallah, Gojra u/s 342 Cr.P.C without oath.\n\nQ.14 Have you any thing else to say?\n\nAns. Iam innocent. The real facts of the present case are\nthat I had a family terms and good relations with\nMuhammad Nawaz Gill and also friendly terms with\nRaheel Gill. Muhammad Nawaz Gill suffered heart\nattack on 21.4.2006. He was admitted in Bashir\nClinic Quaid-i-Azam Road, Gojra. His wife and\ndaughter remained present with him round the clock\nand I used to visit him during night regularly and\nduring day hours occasionally. On the night between\n22/23.4.2006 I was present with Muhammad Nawaz\nin Bashir Clinic. At mid night he felt a severe pain in\nhgis left arm. I had informed the dispenser about the\nprecarious condition of Muhammad Nawaz Gill and\non his information doctor had attended the patient.\nAt that time through telephonic message I had\ninformed Ijaz Gill Nazim U.C., the real brother of\nNawaz Gill and Raheel Gill, real Bhanja of Nawaz Gill\nabout the serious condition of Muhammad Nawaz.\nThey both had come to the clinic after some time, the\ncondition of Muhammad Nawaz Gill became O.K.\nThen Raheel Arif had gone on the pretext that his\nmother is alone at home. At about 3 p.m. when\nMuhammad Nawaz’s condition was satisfactory, I\nleft the clinic for my home. When I reached my\nhouse towards St.No.4, gate was lying open.\nThereafter, I went incise my office and found my\nsister Rabia_ Khalil and _ Raheel Arif both\ncommitting zina with each other. I was holding\nmy licensed pistol, I lost senses and self control\nand in the above said circumstances under grave\nand _ sudden provocation I made _ fire with my\n\n18 See K. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra, AIR 1962 SC 605\n\nCrl.A No.154-L/2013 etc. 9\n\npistol on Raheel Arif when he was trying to flee\naway from the spot and he sustained injury on\nhis shin in the deohri and he fell down outside\nthe house in street. Then I made successive fires\nwith pistol which landed on different parts of his\nbody and in the same mental condition I went\ninside the house and made fire with repeater gun\non my sister Rabia Khalil and she also fell down.\nThereafter, I acame back in the street and I made\nfurther firing on Raheel Arif with repeater gun 12\nbore. The occurrence was not witnessed by the PWs.\nAfter the occurrence I had informed the police at PS\nthrough telephone and informed them about the\npresent occurrence. On the arrival of the 1.O., I had\ninformed Ijaz Gill Nazim U.C through telephonic\nmessage, thereafter the complainant had come to the\nplace of occurrence with Mehtab Ahmed Cheema and\nconcocted this false story and involved me in this\nfalse case. I was in police custody since 23.4.2006.\nOn the asking of I.0. on 24.4.2006, I had written my\nstatement and produced the same before him which\nis now on judicial record as Ex.DG. The underwear of\nRabia Khalil was found to be stained with semen.....”\n(emphasis supplied)\n\nScope and purpose of section 342 Cr.P.C\n\n15. Before examining the effect of statement of the\nappellant made under section 342 Cr.P.C, it is necessary to explore\nthe scope and evidentiary value of a statement made under Section\n342 of the Cr.P.C, which is reproduced below:-\n\n342. Power to examine the accused. (1) For the\npurpose of enabling the accused to explain any\ncircumstances appearing in the evidence against\nhim, the Court may, at any stage of any inquiry or\ntrial without previously warning the accused, put\nsuch questions to him as the Court considers\nnecessary, and shall for the purpose aforesaid,\nquestion him generally on the case after the\nwitnesses for the prosecution have been examined\nand before he is called on for his defence.\n\n(2) The accused shall not render himself liable to\npunishment by refusing to answer such questions or\nby giving false answers to them; but the Court may\ndraw such inference from such refusal or answer as\nit thinks just.\n\n(3) The answers given by the accused may be taken\ninto consideration in such inquiry or trial, and put\nin evidence for or against him in any other inquiry\ninto, or trial for, any other offence which such\nanswers may tend to show he has committed.\n\n\nCrl.A No.154-L/2013 etc. 10\n\n(4) Except as provided by subsection (2) of S. 340 no\noath shall be administered to the accused.\n(emphasis supplied)\n16. Bare reading of section 342 Cr.P.C shows that its\nprimary purpose is to enable the accused to know and to explain\nand respond to the evidence brought against him by the\nprosecution. It is essential that attention of the accused must be\nbrought to all the vital parts of the evidence brought against him\nby the prosecution, especially if he is an ignorant person who\ncannot be expected to know or understand what particular parts of\nthe evidence are or are likely to be considered by the Court to be\nagainst him. The purpose is to establish a direct dialogue between\nthe Court and the accused and to put every important\nincriminating piece of evidence to the accused and grant him an\nopportunity to answer and explain.!9 Muhammed Sharif, J. in\nAbdul Wahab ”° eloquently explained the object of section 342\nCr.P.C in the following words: “It should not ... be overlooked that\nthe real object of section 342 is not to subject the accused to a\ndetailed cross-examination. It is, as a matter of fact, inviting his\nattention to the point or points in the evidence which are likely to\ninfluence the mind of the judge in arriving at conclusions adverse\nto the accused, and before such an adverse inference can be\ndrawn, the accused should be afforded an opportunity to offer an\n\nexplanation, if he has any.”\n\nStatus of a statement under section 342 Cr.P.C\n\n17. The words “taken into consideration” appearing in\nsection 342(3), Cr.P.C are very wide. The statement of an accused\nrecorded under section 342, Cr.P.C, has no less probative value\nthan any other “matter” which may be taken into consideration\nagainst him within the contemplation of the definition of “proved”\ngiven in Article 2(4) of the QSO27! (previously section 3 of the\nEvidence Act, 1872), which states that a fact is said to be proved\n\n19 see Tani v. Emperor, 20 Cr.L.J 12 (Nag); Md. Illias Mistri v. The King, (1949) ILR 1 Cal\n43; Abdul Wahab v. Crown, PLD 1955 FC 88, at p. 90; Santan Naskar v. State of West\nBengal, AIR 2010 SC 3570.\n\n20 Abdul Wahab’s case ibid.\n\n21 Varand Fazal, ILR (1944) Kar 114, per O’Sullivan J.\n\nCrl.A No.154-L/2013 etc. 11\n\nwhen, after considering the matters before it, the Court either\nbelieves it to exist, or considers its existence so probable that a\nprudent man ought, under the circumstances of the particular\ncase, to act upon the supposition that it exists. Muhammad Munir,\nJ., in Rahim Bakhsh??, regarding statement under section 342\nCr.P.C. wrote: “I know of no law which says that an admission\nmade by an accused person in or out of court unless it is vitiated\nby any such circumstances as are mentioned in the Indian\nEvidence Act, cannot be considered to be a matter which the court\nmay take into consideration in coming to its conclusion.” The\ncircumstances which can vitiate an admission or confession,\nreferred to by the learned Judge, may be of inducement, threat or\npromise under which a particular statement is made. A statement\nunder section 342, Cr.P.C. having been made by an accused before\ncourt in presence of his counsel has little chance of suffering from\nsuch circumstances.28 However, an admission or confession which\nis improbable or unbelievable, or is not consistent with the overall\nfacts and circumstances of a case may not have any probative\nvalue and thus cannot be relied upon by the court for reaching to a\n\nconclusion.2+\n\nConviction on the basis of the statement of the accused under\nsection 342 Cr.P.C.\n\n18. In Abdur Rehman,25  Amin,?6 Mehrban,?7 Magqsood, 28\nand Sattar,?9 the High Court disbelieved the prosecution evidence\nbut convicted the accused persons for the offence punishable\nunder section 302(c) PPC or the erstwhile section 304-I PPC on the\nbasis of the statements under section 342 Cr.P.C., of having\ncommitted the offences on account of grave and sudden\n\nprovocation, without requiring them to prove their statements.

In Hanif, this Court maintained the judgment of the\ntrial court whereby the accused had been convicted for offence\nunder section 302(c) PPC, after rejection of the prosecution\nevidence, on the basis of his plea of having committed the murder\nunder the circumstances of grave and sudden provocation. In Ali\nMuhammad, this Court reversed the acquittal judgment of the High\nCourt and convicted the accused under section 302(c) PPC, despite\nrejection of the prosecution evidence, on the basis of version of the\naccused taken in statement under section 342 Cr.P.C. The version\nof the accused, in that case, was that he saw the deceased and his\nwife lying on the same bed in an objectionable position, and acted\nunder sting of grave and sudden provocation. In Shamoon,?? this\nCourt while relying upon the plea of the accused narrated in\nstatement under section 342 Cr.P.C, of having acted under grave\nand sudden provocation converted his sentence from section 302\nPPC to 304-II PPC, as both the Courts below had disbelieved the\nocular testimony of the prosecution witnesses. This Court, in Gul\nNissa,33 made an explicit and unequivocal statement of law that\n“accused can be convicted on his own statement even if the\n\nprosecution evidence is rejected”.\n\nPrinciples governing section 342 Cr.P.C\n\n20. The principles surrounding section 342 Cr.P.C have\nevolved for over a period of the last about two hundred years\nbeginning with the case of Sarah Jones** (decided in 1827) and\n\ntaking shape in Balmakund* as follows:\n\n“..where there is no other evidence to show\naffirmatively that any portion of the exculpatory\n\n30 State v. Muhammad Hanif, 1992 SCMR 2047, per Shafi-ur-Rahman J.\n31 Ali Muhammad v. Ali Muhammad, PLD 1996 SC 274, per Fazal Karim J.\n32 Shamoon v. State, 1995 SCMR 1377.\n\n33 Gul Nissa v. Muhammad Yousuf, PLD 2006 SC 556.\n\n34 Rex v. Sarah Jones, [1827] 2 Carrington and Pyne 629\n\n35 Balmakund v. Emperor, AIR 1931 All 1.\n\nCrl.A No.154-L/2013 etc. 13\n\nelement in the confession is false, the Court must\naccept or reject the confession as a whole and cannot\naccept only the inculpatory element while rejecting the\nexculpatory element as inherently incredible.”\n\nThese principles have been refined and rearticulated by our own\n\ncourts.\n\nA. When prosecution fails to prove its case - the statement of the\naccused, under section 342 Cr.P.C. is to be considered in its entirety\nand accepted as a fact.\n\nSir Abdul Rashid J., the then Chief Justice of Federal Court of\nPakistan observed in Rahim Bakhsh*¢ that if the conviction of an\naccused is to be based solely on his statement in Court then that\nstatement should be taken into consideration in its entirety. In\nMehrban?’ S.A. Rahman J. speaking for a five member bench of\nthis Court held that “[iJt was not open to the learned Judges, after\nhaving rejected the prosecution evidence as unreliable, to dissect\nthe accused’s statement and accept it in part and reject the rest of\nit.” In Najib Raza*® this Court agreed with Mahajan J. who\nobserved that “it is settled law that an admission made by a person\nwhether amounting to a confession or not cannot be split up and\npart of it used against him.°°” In Faiz,4° another five member\nBench of this Court held that where the conviction is based\nentirely on the statement of the accused then the statement should\nbe taken into consideration in its entirety as the reply or the\nnarration of the accused “is not tested or completed either by\ncross-examining him or by putting him further questions. The\nstate of his [accused’s] mind is not prodded. His bare statement\n\nabout it exists on record, for whatever its worth. In the absence of\n\nany other evidence, it has to be accepted as a fact”*!, and cannot\n\nbe rejected by adopting a process of appraisement and analysis.*2\n\nIn Sultan,#? Abdul Qadeer Chaudhry, J. spoke for the Court to hold\n\n36 Rahim Bakhsh v. Crown, PLD 1952 FC 1.\n\n37 Mehrban Shah v. State, 1969 SCMR 839.\n\n38 Najib Raza Rehmani v. State, PLD 1978 SC 200.\n\n39 Hanumani Govind Nargundi v. State of Madhya Pardesh, AIR 1952 SC 343\n40 Faiz v. State, 1983 SCMR 76.\n\n41 Id. para 9, emphasis supplied\n\n42 Waris Khan v. Ishtiaq, PLD 1986 SC 335.\n\n43 Sultan Khan v. Sher Khan, PLD 1991 SC 520.\n\nCrl.A No.154-L/2013 etc. 14\n\nthat when the prosecution fails to setup a case against the accused\nand the entire evidence of the prosecution has been discarded and\ndisbelieved the statement of the accused under section 342 Cr.P.C\nhas to be taken into consideration in toto (in its entirety) and the\nCourt cannot select a portion out of the statement that goes\n\nagainst the accused.\n\nB. The inculpatory part of the statement of the accused cannot be\nused or construed to fill up gaps in the case of the prosecution as the\nprosecution has to prove the case on its own evidence.\n\n21. Sultan*4 went ahead to add that if there is prosecution\nevidence which disproves the exculpatory part of the statement of\nthe accused under section 342 Cr.P.C, then reliance can be placed\non the inculpatory part of the statement by excluding the\nexculpatory part, but not otherwise. In other words, if the\nprosecution has proved a case against the accused beyond\nreasonable doubt, the court may, if it deems expedient to get\nfurther support, take into consideration also the inculpatory part\nof the statement of the accused under section 342 Cr.P.C., only if\nthe prosecution evidence negatives the exculpatory part of the\nstatement and it can be safely severed from the inculpatory part\nbut not otherwise. It is underlined that even if this exercise is not\nundertaken the conviction of the accused stands as_ the\nprosecution has already proved its case against the accused\nbeyond reasonable doubt, on the basis of its evidence. The\ninculpatory part of the statement is not being considered to fill up\ngaps in the case of the prosecution but simply to draw support in a\n\ncase already established by the prosecution and no more.\n\nC. Where prosecution has failed_and_the_ statement of the accused\nunder section 342 Cr.P.C. is accepted in entirety, the court is then to\ngwe due effect to the statement of the accused, under the law,\nwhether in favour of or against the accused.\n\n22. Next comes the question, how such a statement of the\naccused when “accepted as a fact+5” and taken in its entirety is to\n\nbe given effect and acted upon, once the prosecution has failed to\n\n44 Id.\n45 Faiz v. State, 1983 SCMR 76, para 9.\n\nCrl.A No.154-L/2013 etc. 15\n\nmake out a case? Once the prosecution evidence is disbelieved,\nrejected or excluded from consideration, and the facts explained by\nthe accused in his statement under section 342 Cr.P.C. are\naccepted entirely, the court is then to examine the said facts to\ngive due effect to the statement of the accused, under the law,\nwhether in favour of or against the accused.*© The object of such\nexamination is to determine whether or not the facts narrated by\nthe accused constitute an offence under the law or fit into any\nexception of the offence provided under the law. In this respect, the\nobservation of Sir Mukerji J., made in the case of Bhola Nath 4’ is\nquoted to explain the purpose of this examination of the statement\n\nof the accused. The learned Judge observed, at page 5:\n\n“If on the whole of the statement of the accused, taken together,\nhis guilt is established, and his plea, say, of acting in self-defence\nor of the case falling within any of the general or special\nexceptions (sic) is not made out_on the facts admitted, there\ncannot be any bar to a conviction, simply because the prosecution\nevidence, by itself, would not have secured a conviction...... ”\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\nThis legal examination was also aptly explained and applied by\nLobo C.J. in Gul Mahomed *8. The learned Judge found that\naccepting the statement of the appellant as true, the act of the\nappellant in killing his wife and another was under grave\nprovocation but it was not under sudden provocation. The facts\nnarrated by the appellant though were accepted but those were\nfound not to fit in the legal parameters of Exception-I to section\n300 PPC for making the case of the appellant as one of grave and\nsudden provocation. Likewise, this Court, in Muhammad Azam ?9,\nthough admitted the statement under section 342 Cr.P.C. as a\nwhole, but found, even in those admitted facts, the accused to\nhave exceeded in his right of self-defence and convicted him\naccordingly. In Sattar referred above the accused while explaining\nthe circumstances in which he inflicted injuries to him, claimed to\n\nhave acted in the exercise of right of self-defence. But the High\n\n46 see Jagdeo v. Emperor, 38 IC 740.\n\n47 Bhola Nath v. Emperor, AIR 1929 Allahabad 1.\n48 Gul Mahomed v. Emperor, AIR 1945 Sindh 42.\n49 Muhammad Azam v. State, PLJ 2009 SC 1120.\n\nCrl.A No.154-L/2013 etc. 16\n\nCourt though accepted his statement of facts in its entirety, but\nconvicted him under section 304-I PPC by treating his version not\nto fit in the legal requirement of the valid exercise of right of self-\ndefence as the accused as per his own version of facts had chased\nthe deceased in street who was attempting to escape from the place\n\nof occurrence.\n\nSummary of principles of law regarding article 121, QSO and section\n342 Cr.P.C,\n\n23. We consider it appropriate to recapitulate and\nsummarise key principles of law discussed in this judgment,\nregarding article 121, QSO and section 342, Cr.P.C., for\n\nconvenience, which are stated as under:\n\ni. The burden, in a criminal case, to prove the guilt of\nthe accused is always on the prosecution. Therefore,\nthe court, in the first instance, is to discuss and\nassess the prosecution evidence, in order to arrive at\nthe conclusion as to whether or not the prosecution\nhas succeeded in proving the charge against the\naccused on the basis of its evidence.\n\nii. In a case where the accused has not taken any specific\nplea (e.g. self defence, grave and sudden provocation\netc.) or has not produced any evidence in his defence,\nthe court should decide the question of success or\nfailure of the prosecution in proving the charge against\nthe accused on the basis of the prosecution evidence\nalone.\n\niii. In a case where the accused has taken a specific plea\nor has produced evidence in his defence, the court\nshould appraise the prosecution case and the defense\nversion in juxtaposition, in order to arrive at a just\nconclusion. Even in such situation the burden\nremains on the prosecution to prove the necessary\ningredients of the offence charged against the accused,\nand it does not shift upon the accused merely by\ntaking a defence plea or producing evidence in his\ndefence.\n\nCrl.A No.154-L/2013 etc. 17\n\nvi.\n\nvii.\n\nviii.\n\nThe burden shifts upon the accused under Article 121\nof the QSO to prove his defense plea, only when a\nprima facie case is made out against him by the\nprosecution on the basis of its evidence. If the\nprosecution fails to prove its case against the accused,\nthe question of shifting of burden on the accused does\nnot arise.\n\nThe primary purpose of section 342 Cr.P.C. is to\nenable the accused to know and to explain and\nrespond to the evidence brought against him by the\nprosecution. A direct dialogue is established between\nthe Court and the accused by putting every important\nincriminating piece of evidence to the accused and\ngranting him an opportunity to answer and explain.\n\nIf the prosecution fails to prove its case against the\naccused, the court can take into consideration the\nstatement of the accused under section 342 Cr.P.C.\nwhether in favour of or against the accused; but it\nmust take into consideration that statement in its\nentirety and cannot select and place reliance on the\ninculpatory part of the statement only.\n\nIn the last mentioned circumstance, the facts narrated\nby the accused in his statement under section 342\nCr.P.C. are to be accepted without requiring their\nproof. The court, however, should examine the said\nfacts in order to give due effect to them under the law.\nThe object of such examination is to determine\nwhether or not the facts narrated by the accused\nconstitute an offence under the law or fit into any\nexception of the offence provided under the law.\n\nAn admission or confession made in statement under\nsection 342 Cr.P.C., which is improbable or\nunbelievable, or is not consistent with the overall facts\nand circumstances of a case do not have any probative\nvalue and thus it cannot be relied upon by the court\nfor reaching a conclusion.\n\n24. The above settled principles of law when applied to the\n\npresent case, we find that the prosecution has failed to prove the\n\nCrl.A No.154-L/2013 etc. 18\n\ncase against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt, on the basis\nof its evidence. We, therefore, revert to the defense plea and the\nstatement of the appellant made under section 342 Cr.P.C., which\nis to be accepted in its entirety without requiring the proof under\nArticle 121, QSO. The appellant, in his statement under section\n342 Cr.P.C., has explained that he killed his sister and her\nparamour on grave and sudden provocation as he saw them\ncommitting zina when entered in his house at 03:00 am in the\nnight, on his return from the hospital. His statement is not\nimprobable or unbelievable, nor is it inconsistent with the overall\nfacts and circumstances of the case; therefore, it can safely be\nrelied and acted upon. Our culture and social values reflected in\nthe jurisprudence®° developed so far is that an act of illicit sex with\na female family member of the offender is considered sufficient to\ncause provocation so grave and sudden that it would deprive the\noffender of the power of self-control. The arguments on behalf of\nthe complainant have been made only to convince this Court to\nbelieve the prosecution story, though they could not succeed; and\nit has not even been argued that the facts and circumstances\nnarrated by the appellant under which he committed the murder of\nRaheel Arif, if admitted to be correct, do not constitute grave and\nsudden provocation. In the light of the scope and meaning of grave\nand sudden provocation discussed in para 13 above, the statement\nof the appellant when taken as a whole, establishes grave and\nsudden provocation. The case of the appellant to the extent of\nmurder of Raheel Arif, therefore, falls within the scope of section\n302(c) P.P.C; hence, his appeal is partly allowed to the extent of the\nimpugned judgment of the High Court. The judgment of the High\nCourt whereby the appellant was convicted under section 302(b)\nPPC for the murder of Raheel Arif is set aside, while that of the\n\nTrial Court convicting the appellant under section 302(c) PPC is\n\n50 See Muhammad Qasim v. State, PLD 2018 SC 840; Gul Nissa v. Muhammad Yousuf,\nPLD 2006 SC 556; Naseer Hussain v. Nawaz, 1994 SCMR 1504; Noor Muhammad v.\nState, 1993 SCMR 208; and cases referred to in paras 18 and 19 of this judgment.\n\nCrl.A No.154-L/2013 etc. 19\n\nrestored. However, the sentence of the appellant is modified. The\nappellant is sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for a period of 15\nyears, in the peculiar circumstances of the case. He is also directed\nto pay compensation of Rs.100,000/- (one hundred thousand) to\nthe legal heirs of the deceased, in terms of section 544-A, Code of\nCriminal Procedure, and in default whereof to undergo simple\nimprisonment for six months. Benefit of Section 382-B, Code of\nCriminal Procedure is extended to the appellant. Consequently,\ncriminal petition for leave to appeal filed by the complainant for\nenhancement of the sentence of the appellant from life\nimprisonment to death is dismissed for being without merit and\n\nleave to appeal is refused.\n\n25. Foregoing are the reasons for our short order of even\ndate.\nJudge\nJudge\nJudge\nLahore,\n\n14th March, 2019.\nApproved for reporting.\n\n<->", "CleanedText": "JUDGMENT Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, J.- Ali Ahmad the appellant , murdered his sister, Rabia Khalil and her paramour, Raheel Arif, in his own house, in the wee hours of the night 3:00 am on 23.04.2006. He was thereafter booked in FIR No.155 of the same date registered at Police Station, City Gojra, District Toba Tek Singh for offences punishable under section 302 P.P.C. After regular trial, he was convicted under section 302 c PPC and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 10 years by the Trial Court. Upon appeal by the complainant the High Court through impugned judgment dated 26.02.2013 set-aside the judgment of the trial court and convicted the appellant under section 302 b , PPC and sentenced him to imprisonment for life, thereby the Crl.A No.154-L/2013 etc. 2 criminal appeal of the complainant was allowed, whereas the criminal appeal filed by the appellant seeking acquittal was dismissed. 2. When this appeal came up for hearing before this Court on 27.3.2014, it was pointed out that the heirs of the deceased Rabia Khalil had entered into compromise with the appellant. Criminal Misc. Application No.512-L/2013 was placed on the record in this regard, which was allowed and the appeal of the appellant was partly accepted to the extent of Rabia Khalil and conviction of the appellant qua her murder was set aside, while the appeal to the extent of conviction qua the murder of Raheel Arif was kept pending, which has come up for hearing before us today. 3. Story of the prosecution is that the brother of the complainant, Muhammad Nawaz, was hospitalized due to a heart condition at Bashir Clinic, Gojra Road, Gojra on 21.04.2006. The appellant, having close terms with Muhammad Nawaz and his family, regularly visited him at the clinic. At the end of one of his visits to the clinic on 23.04.2006, the appellant, around 2:15 am, requested Raheel Arif, nephew of the complainant, to walk him home from the clinic. Around 3:00 am, the same night, the complainant, who was also at the clinic, went out to drop Hassan Iftikhar PW-12 and Adeel Arif brother of Raheel Arif home on his motorbike. The complainant party on their way home and while passing by Mehdi Mohalah, heard a fire shot in a street and on hearing the same, turned and drove into that street and saw the appellant firing at Raheel Arif, who succumbed to his injuries and died in the street. The crime report continues to state that thereafter the appellant went into the house and locked the door and more fire shots were heard from inside the house. According to prosecution the motive behind the murder was that the appellant suspected that Raheel Arif had illicit relations with his sister Rabia Khalil. Crl.A No.154-L/2013 etc. 3 4. The defence version, as per statement of the appellant recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C, is that he murdered the deceased and his sister due to grave and sudden provocation when he saw his sister in a compromising position with the deceased, as he returned home from medical clinic in the wee hours of the night on 23.4.2006. 5. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have examined the record and the judgments of the courts below. The trial court disbelieved the presence of the eye-witnesses, the complainant, Ali Ahmad PW-11 and Hassan Iftikhar PW-12 at the site of the occurrence after a careful appraisal of their testimony, supported by cogent reasons. The High Court has not upset the said findings in the impugned judgment. Additionally, we find that according to the prosecution the complainant PW-11 set out on his motorbike to drop Hassan Iftikhar PW-12 and Adeel Arif brother of the deceased Raheel Arif at their respective homes. In the cross-examination the eye-witnesses PW-11 and PW-12 and Syed Kazim Hussin PW-1 , the draftsman who prepared the site plan Ex-PA , stated that the place of occurrence does not fall on the way to their homes. The site plan Ex-PA does not even show that the road to Samundari Road, Gulshan Colony or Abdullahpur areas where residences of PW-12, Adeel Arif and PW11 are situate passes through the place of occurrence. According to the site plan the complainant party saw the occurrence from a distance of 297 feet, in the dead of the night. There is a contradiction between the statements of the two eye-witnesses PW-11 PW-12 regarding their distance from the site of occurrence, PW-12 categorically stated in his cross-examination that he was present during the occurrence at a distance of 14/15 feet from the place of occurrence, while PW-11 supports the site plan which describes the distance to be 297 feet. This inconsistency between the statement of the two eye-witnesses casts doubt on the case of the prosecution. The light of the motorcycle and a private bulb installed in the doorway of the house Crl.A No.154-L/2013 etc. 4 of the appellant is also suspect as neither the said bulb nor the motorcycle was recovered. Adeel Arif, one of the three eyewitnesses, being the real brother of the deceased and as a consequence being the most aggrieved amongst them, was given up by the prosecution as being unnecessary, giving rise to an adverse inference regarding his presence at the scene of the crime. The above analysis makes the presence of the eye-witnesses at the crime scene doubtful, as concluded by the trial court. 6. With the presence of the eye-witnesses doubtful at the scene of the crime, it is not safe to place reliance on the ocular account. As a consequence, the medical evidence or the recovery of the firearm from the appellant lends little support or corroboration, to the case of the prosecution. For the above reasons we are of the view that the prosecution failed to establish the culpability of the appellant, on the basis of its evidence. 7. The High Court did not examine the case of the prosecution and appraise its evidence to find out whether the prosecution had succeeded to prove the charge against the accused but instead, examined only the defence plea by placing reliance on Article 121 of the Qanun-e-Shahdat Order, 1984 QSO and held that the appellant had failed to prove his plea of grave and sudden provocation as taken in his statement under section 342 Cr.P.C and proceeded to convict him under section 302 b PPC for the offence of honour killing , as alleged by the prosecution. Process of appraising evidence and scope of Article 121 of QSO 8. In a criminal trial, it is now jurisprudentially wellentrenched, the proper course for the court is to first discuss and assess the prosecution evidence, particularly the reliability of the eye-witnesses, in order to arrive at the conclusion as to whether or not the prosecution has succeeded in proving the charge against the accused on the basis of its evidence.! Burden is always on the 1 See Ashiq Hussain v. State, PLD 1994 SC 879. Crl.A No.154-L/2013 etc. 5 prosecution to prove its case and it is only when a prima facie case is made out against the accused sufficient to justify his conviction, does the burden shift upon the accused under Article 121 of the QSO, if he relies on any of the General Exceptions in the P.P.C or within any special exception or proviso contained in any other part of the PPC or in any law defining the offence charged.? If the prosecution fails to prove its case against the accused, the question of shifting of burden upon the accused does not arise as it becomes immaterial. Where the accused has taken a defence plea like, self defence, provocation, accident, etc. which relates to an essential ingredient of the offence charged, the court is to appraise the prosecution case and the defense version in juxtaposition to adjudicate the matter. 9. The approach adopted by the High Court, in the instant case, in examining the defence plea of grave and sudden provocation in isolation from the prosecution evidence was incorrect. The High Court did not appraise the prosecution evidence at all and convicted the appellant, under section 302 b PPC, on the basis of its finding that he had failed to establish his defence plea of grave and sudden provocation. This approach of the High Court in coming to the conclusion of the culpability of the appellant was contrary to the law declared by the two larger benches of this Court in the cases of Wali Muhammad? and Ashiq Hussain. In the cited cases this Court authoritatively declared that the accused cannot be convicted on the ground that his defense plea appears unconvincing. The prosecution is duty bound to prove its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt on the basis of its own evidence and is not absolved of this duty even if the accused has taken a defence plea. 2 See Shamoon v. State, 1995 SCMR 1377; Mushtaq Hussain v. State, 2011 SCMR 45, er Rahmat Hussain Jafferi, J. See Safdar Ali v. Crown, PLD 1953 FC 93; Abdul Haque v. Sate, PLD 1996 SC 1; Mst. Mumtaz Begum v. Ghulam Farid, 2003 SCMR 647; Lal Khan v. Crown, PLD 1952 Lah 502; Ghulam Yousaf v. Crown, PLD 1953 Lah 213; State v. Balahari, PLD 1962 Dacca 467 4 Wali Muhammad v. State, 1969 SCMR 612, five member Bench . 5 Ashiq Hussain v. State, 1993 SCMR 417, five member Bench . Crl.A No.154-L/2013 etc. 6 10. Reliance by the High Court on Feroze is misplaced; because in Feroze the learned trial court convicted the accused, and the High Court affirmed it, on the basis of the evidence of the prosecution and not on failure of the accused to prove its defence plea and this Court maintained the decisions of the courts below by refusing leave to appeal. However, if Feroze creates an impression that the prosecution evidence needs not to be appraised/examined in a case where the accused has taken a defence plea, we strongly dispel the same and reinforce the aforesaid view of the larger benches of this Court expressed in Wali Muhammad and Ashiq Hussain. 11. Consistent jurisprudence has evolved over the years by several judgments of this Court, wherein the accused persons were acquitted by accepting their plea taken in statement under section 342 Cr.P.C., of having acted in furtherance of self-defence, when the prosecution had failed to prove its case against them. The cases of Mehrban, Najib Raza, Waris Khan,? Muhammad Aksar, Faiz!! and Sultan!2 may be referred in this regard. These cases do not discuss Article 121, QSO!5 as the accused is not required to prove his plea of self-defense, on failure of the prosecution to prove its case. Honour killing vis-a-vis grave sudden provocation 12. The High Court has also relied on Ameer , for holding that the case is one of honour killing and not of grave and sudden provocation, without fully appreciating the difference between the two. In case of honour killing the act of murder is well thought out, calculated and pre-mediated, while in case of grave and sudden provocation the act is committed on the spur of the moment Feroze v. State, 2008 SCMR 696. 7 Mehrban Shah v. State, 1969 SCMR 839. 8 Najib Raza Rehmani v. State, PLD 1978 SC 200. Waris Khan v. Ishtiaq, PLD 1986 SC 335. 10 Muhammad Aksar v. State, 1990 SCMR 1053. 11 Faiz v. State, 1983 SCMR 76. 12 Sultan Khan v. Sher Khan, PLD 1991 SC 520. 13 previously section 105 of the Evidence Act, 1872 14 Muhammad Ameer v. State, PLD 2006 SC 283. Crl.A No.154-L/2013 etc. 7 without any pre-planning or deliberation!S. Family honour may be at the root of both the acts, still there is a difference between the two; in case of honour killing the act is pre-meditated and a planned one, while in case of grave and sudden provocation the act is so sudden that it entails no prior deliberation or planning. Reliance by the High Court on Ameer is misplaced as the murder in that case was a pre-meditated one. This glaring distinguishing fact has not been appreciated by the High Court. It is also important to shed some light on the meaning and scope of the expression, grave and sudden provocation. Meaning and scope of grave and sudden provocation 13. The expression grave and sudden provocation was used by the Legislature in Exception-1 to the erstwhile section 300 of PPC as: Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation. It is clearly spelt out from the said provisions that the provocation offered by the act of the victim must be so grave and sudden that it would deprive the offender of the power of selfcontrol. Provocation in law thus consists mainly of three elements: 1 the act of provocation, 2 the loss of self-control, and 3 the retaliation/reaction proportionate to the provocation. The relationship of these elements to each other, particularly in point of time, is of the foremost importance to determine whether there was time for passion to cool and reason to resume.! The whole doctrine relating to provocation depends on the fact that it causes, or may cause, a sudden and temporary loss of self-control, whereby malice which is the formation of an intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm, is negatived.! The proportionality of the reaction to the provocation is tested on the touchstone of the reaction expected from a reasonable person. What a reasonable 15 see Muhammad Qasim v. State, PLD 2018 SC 840; Muhammad Ameer v. State, PLD 2006 SC 283; Ali Muhammad v. Ali Ali Muhammad, PLD 1996 SC 274; Naseer Hussain v. Nawaz, 1994 SCMR 1504. 16 See Ali Muhammad v. Ali Ali Muhammad, PLD 1996 SC 274. 17 Holmes v. Director of Public Prosecutions, 1946 A.C. 588. Crl.A No.154-L/2013 etc. 8 man will do in certain circumstances depends upon various factors including the customs, traditions, social and cultural values, and way of life of the society to which he belongs.!8 No abstract standard of reasonableness can be laid down, in this regard. 14. In his statement under section 342, Cr.P.C, the appellant stated that he murdered the deceased and his sister due to grave and sudden provocation when he saw Raheel Arif committing zina with his sister, as he returned home from the medical clinic in the wee hours of the night on 23.4.2006. His statement made under section 342 Cr.P.C is reproduced below, for ready reference: Statement of accused Ali Ahmed s/o Khalil Ahmed caste Butt aged 30 years businessman r/o Mehdi Mohallah, Gojra u/s 342 Cr.P.C without oath. Q.14 Have you any thing else to say? Ans. Iam innocent. The real facts of the present case are that I had a family terms and good relations with Muhammad Nawaz Gill and also friendly terms with Raheel Gill. Muhammad Nawaz Gill suffered heart attack on 21.4.2006. He was admitted in Bashir Clinic Quaid-i-Azam Road, Gojra. His wife and daughter remained present with him round the clock and I used to visit him during night regularly and during day hours occasionally. On the night between 22/23.4.2006 I was present with Muhammad Nawaz in Bashir Clinic. At mid night he felt a severe pain in hgis left arm. I had informed the dispenser about the precarious condition of Muhammad Nawaz Gill and on his information doctor had attended the patient. At that time through telephonic message I had informed Ijaz Gill Nazim U.C., the real brother of Nawaz Gill and Raheel Gill, real Bhanja of Nawaz Gill about the serious condition of Muhammad Nawaz. They both had come to the clinic after some time, the condition of Muhammad Nawaz Gill became O.K. Then Raheel Arif had gone on the pretext that his mother is alone at home. At about 3 p.m. when Muhammad Nawaz s condition was satisfactory, I left the clinic for my home. When I reached my house towards St.No.4, gate was lying open. Thereafter, I went incise my office and found my sister Rabia Khalil and Raheel Arif both committing zina with each other. I was holding my licensed pistol, I lost senses and self control and in the above said circumstances under grave and sudden provocation I made fire with my 18 See K. M. Nanavati vs State Of Maharashtra, AIR 1962 SC 605 Crl.A No.154-L/2013 etc. 9 pistol on Raheel Arif when he was trying to flee away from the spot and he sustained injury on his shin in the deohri and he fell down outside the house in street. Then I made successive fires with pistol which landed on different parts of his body and in the same mental condition I went inside the house and made fire with repeater gun on my sister Rabia Khalil and she also fell down. Thereafter, I acame back in the street and I made further firing on Raheel Arif with repeater gun 12 bore. The occurrence was not witnessed by the PWs. After the occurrence I had informed the police at PS through telephone and informed them about the present occurrence. On the arrival of the 1.O., I had informed Ijaz Gill Nazim U.C through telephonic message, thereafter the complainant had come to the place of occurrence with Mehtab Ahmed Cheema and concocted this false story and involved me in this false case. I was in police custody since 23.4.2006. On the asking of I.0. on 24.4.2006, I had written my statement and produced the same before him which is now on judicial record as Ex.DG. The underwear of Rabia Khalil was found to be stained with semen..... emphasis supplied Scope and purpose of section 342 Cr.P.C 15. Before examining the effect of statement of the appellant made under section 342 Cr.P.C, it is necessary to explore the scope and evidentiary value of a statement made under Section 342 of the Cr.P.C, which is reproduced below:- 342. Power to examine the accused. 1 For the purpose of enabling the accused to explain any circumstances appearing in the evidence against him, the Court may, at any stage of any inquiry or trial without previously warning the accused, put such questions to him as the Court considers necessary, and shall for the purpose aforesaid, question him generally on the case after the witnesses for the prosecution have been examined and before he is called on for his defence. 2 The accused shall not render himself liable to punishment by refusing to answer such questions or by giving false answers to them; but the Court may draw such inference from such refusal or answer as it thinks just. 3 The answers given by the accused may be taken into consideration in such inquiry or trial, and put in evidence for or against him in any other inquiry into, or trial for, any other offence which such answers may tend to show he has committed. Crl.A No.154-L/2013 etc. 10 4 Except as provided by subsection 2 of S. 340 no oath shall be administered to the accused. emphasis supplied 16. Bare reading of section 342 Cr.P.C shows that its primary purpose is to enable the accused to know and to explain and respond to the evidence brought against him by the prosecution. It is essential that attention of the accused must be brought to all the vital parts of the evidence brought against him by the prosecution, especially if he is an ignorant person who cannot be expected to know or understand what particular parts of the evidence are or are likely to be considered by the Court to be against him. The purpose is to establish a direct dialogue between the Court and the accused and to put every important incriminating piece of evidence to the accused and grant him an opportunity to answer and explain.!9 Muhammed Sharif, J. in Abdul Wahab eloquently explained the object of section 342 Cr.P.C in the following words: It should not ... be overlooked that the real object of section 342 is not to subject the accused to a detailed cross-examination. It is, as a matter of fact, inviting his attention to the point or points in the evidence which are likely to influence the mind of the judge in arriving at conclusions adverse to the accused, and before such an adverse inference can be drawn, the accused should be afforded an opportunity to offer an explanation, if he has any. Status of a statement under section 342 Cr.P.C 17. The words taken into consideration appearing in section 342 3 , Cr.P.C are very wide. The statement of an accused recorded under section 342, Cr.P.C, has no less probative value than any other matter which may be taken into consideration against him within the contemplation of the definition of proved given in Article 2 4 of the QSO27! previously section 3 of the Evidence Act, 1872 , which states that a fact is said to be proved 19 see Tani v. Emperor, 20 Cr.L.J 12 Nag ; Md. Illias Mistri v. The King, 1949 ILR 1 Cal 43; Abdul Wahab v. Crown, PLD 1955 FC 88, at p. 90; Santan Naskar v. State of West Bengal, AIR 2010 SC 3570. 20 Abdul Wahab s case ibid. 21 Varand Fazal, ILR 1944 Kar 114, per O Sullivan J. Crl.A No.154-L/2013 etc. 11 when, after considering the matters before it, the Court either believes it to exist, or considers its existence so probable that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the supposition that it exists. Muhammad Munir, J., in Rahim Bakhsh??, regarding statement under section 342 Cr.P.C. wrote: I know of no law which says that an admission made by an accused person in or out of court unless it is vitiated by any such circumstances as are mentioned in the Indian Evidence Act, cannot be considered to be a matter which the court may take into consideration in coming to its conclusion. The circumstances which can vitiate an admission or confession, referred to by the learned Judge, may be of inducement, threat or promise under which a particular statement is made. A statement under section 342, Cr.P.C. having been made by an accused before court in presence of his counsel has little chance of suffering from such circumstances.28 However, an admission or confession which is improbable or unbelievable, or is not consistent with the overall facts and circumstances of a case may not have any probative value and thus cannot be relied upon by the court for reaching to a conclusion.2 Conviction on the basis of the statement of the accused under section 342 Cr.P.C. 18. In Abdur Rehman,25 Amin,?6 Mehrban,?7 Magqsood, 28 and Sattar,?9 the High Court disbelieved the prosecution evidence but convicted the accused persons for the offence punishable under section 302 c PPC or the erstwhile section 304-I PPC on the basis of the statements under section 342 Cr.P.C., of having committed the offences on account of grave and sudden provocation, without requiring them to prove their statements. This 22 Rahim Bakhsh v. Crown, PLD 1952 FC 1. 23 See Nasir Mehmood v. State, 2015 SCMR, per Ijaz Ahmad Chaudhry, J. 4 See Manjeet Singh v. State, PLD 2006 SC 30; Ghulam Abuzar v.

Crl.A No.154-L/2013 etc. 12 Court maintained the conviction recorded by the High Court, in those cases. 19. Hanif? and Ali Muhammad?! may also be referred in this regard. In Hanif, this Court maintained the judgment of the trial court whereby the accused had been convicted for offence under section 302 c PPC, after rejection of the prosecution evidence, on the basis of his plea of having committed the murder under the circumstances of grave and sudden provocation. In Ali Muhammad, this Court reversed the acquittal judgment of the High Court and convicted the accused under section 302 c PPC, despite rejection of the prosecution evidence, on the basis of version of the accused taken in statement under section 342 Cr.P.C. The version of the accused, in that case, was that he saw the deceased and his wife lying on the same bed in an objectionable position, and acted under sting of grave and sudden provocation. In Shamoon,?? this Court while relying upon the plea of the accused narrated in statement under section 342 Cr.P.C, of having acted under grave and sudden provocation converted his sentence from section 302 PPC to 304-II PPC, as both the Courts below had disbelieved the ocular testimony of the prosecution witnesses. This Court, in Gul Nissa,33 made an explicit and unequivocal statement of law that accused can be convicted on his own statement even if the prosecution evidence is rejected . Principles governing section 342 Cr.P.C 20. The principles surrounding section 342 Cr.P.C have evolved for over a period of the last about two hundred years beginning with the case of Sarah Jones decided in 1827 and taking shape in Balmakund as follows: ..where there is no other evidence to show affirmatively that any portion of the exculpatory 30 State v. Muhammad Hanif, 1992 SCMR 2047, per Shafi-ur-Rahman J. 31 Ali Muhammad v. Ali Muhammad, PLD 1996 SC 274, per Fazal Karim J. 32 Shamoon v. State, 1995 SCMR 1377. 33 Gul Nissa v. Muhammad Yousuf, PLD 2006 SC 556. 34 Rex v. Sarah Jones, 1827 2 Carrington and Pyne 629 35 Balmakund v. Emperor, AIR 1931 All 1. Crl.A No.154-L/2013 etc. 13 element in the confession is false, the Court must accept or reject the confession as a whole and cannot accept only the inculpatory element while rejecting the exculpatory element as inherently incredible. These principles have been refined and rearticulated by our own courts. A. When prosecution fails to prove its case - the statement of the accused, under section 342 Cr.P.C. is to be considered in its entirety and accepted as a fact. Sir Abdul Rashid J., the then Chief Justice of Federal Court of Pakistan observed in Rahim Bakhsh that if the conviction of an accused is to be based solely on his statement in Court then that statement should be taken into consideration in its entirety. In Mehrban? S.A. Rahman J. speaking for a five member bench of this Court held that iJt was not open to the learned Judges, after having rejected the prosecution evidence as unreliable, to dissect the accused s statement and accept it in part and reject the rest of it. In Najib Raza this Court agreed with Mahajan J. who observed that it is settled law that an admission made by a person whether amounting to a confession or not cannot be split up and part of it used against him. In Faiz,4 another five member Bench of this Court held that where the conviction is based entirely on the statement of the accused then the statement should be taken into consideration in its entirety as the reply or the narration of the accused is not tested or completed either by cross-examining him or by putting him further questions. The state of his accused s mind is not prodded. His bare statement about it exists on record, for whatever its worth. In the absence of any other evidence, it has to be accepted as a fact !, and cannot be rejected by adopting a process of appraisement and analysis. 2 In Sultan, ? Abdul Qadeer Chaudhry, J. spoke for the Court to hold 36 Rahim Bakhsh v. Crown, PLD 1952 FC 1. 37 Mehrban Shah v. State, 1969 SCMR 839. 38 Najib Raza Rehmani v. State, PLD 1978 SC 200. 39 Hanumani Govind Nargundi v. State of Madhya Pardesh, AIR 1952 SC 343 40 Faiz v. State, 1983 SCMR 76. 41 Id. para 9, emphasis supplied 42 Waris Khan v. Ishtiaq, PLD 1986 SC 335. 43 Sultan Khan v. Sher Khan, PLD 1991 SC 520. Crl.A No.154-L/2013 etc. 14 that when the prosecution fails to setup a case against the accused and the entire evidence of the prosecution has been discarded and disbelieved the statement of the accused under section 342 Cr.P.C has to be taken into consideration in toto in its entirety and the Court cannot select a portion out of the statement that goes against the accused. B. The inculpatory part of the statement of the accused cannot be used or construed to fill up gaps in the case of the prosecution as the prosecution has to prove the case on its own evidence. 21. Sultan 4 went ahead to add that if there is prosecution evidence which disproves the exculpatory part of the statement of the accused under section 342 Cr.P.C, then reliance can be placed on the inculpatory part of the statement by excluding the exculpatory part, but not otherwise. In other words, if the prosecution has proved a case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt, the court may, if it deems expedient to get further support, take into consideration also the inculpatory part of the statement of the accused under section 342 Cr.P.C., only if the prosecution evidence negatives the exculpatory part of the statement and it can be safely severed from the inculpatory part but not otherwise. It is underlined that even if this exercise is not undertaken the conviction of the accused stands as the prosecution has already proved its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt, on the basis of its evidence. The inculpatory part of the statement is not being considered to fill up gaps in the case of the prosecution but simply to draw support in a case already established by the prosecution and no more. C. Where prosecution has failed and the statement of the accused under section 342 Cr.P.C. is accepted in entirety, the court is then to gwe due effect to the statement of the accused, under the law, whether in favour of or against the accused. 22. Next comes the question, how such a statement of the accused when accepted as a fact 5 and taken in its entirety is to be given effect and acted upon, once the prosecution has failed to 44 Id. 45 Faiz v. State, 1983 SCMR 76, para 9. Crl.A No.154-L/2013 etc. 15 make out a case? Once the prosecution evidence is disbelieved, rejected or excluded from consideration, and the facts explained by the accused in his statement under section 342 Cr.P.C. are accepted entirely, the court is then to examine the said facts to give due effect to the statement of the accused, under the law, whether in favour of or against the accused. The object of such examination is to determine whether or not the facts narrated by the accused constitute an offence under the law or fit into any exception of the offence provided under the law. In this respect, the observation of Sir Mukerji J., made in the case of Bhola Nath 4 is quoted to explain the purpose of this examination of the statement of the accused. The learned Judge observed, at : If on the whole of the statement of the accused, taken together, his guilt is established, and his plea, say, of acting in self-defence or of the case falling within any of the general or special exceptions sic is not made out on the facts admitted, there cannot be any bar to a conviction, simply because the prosecution evidence, by itself, would not have secured a conviction...... emphasis supplied This legal examination was also aptly explained and applied by Lobo C.J. in Gul Mahomed 8. The learned Judge found that accepting the statement of the appellant as true, the act of the appellant in killing his wife and another was under grave provocation but it was not under sudden provocation. The facts narrated by the appellant though were accepted but those were found not to fit in the legal parameters of Exception-I to section 300 PPC for making the case of the appellant as one of grave and sudden provocation. Likewise, this Court, in Muhammad Azam ?9, though admitted the statement under section 342 Cr.P.C. as a whole, but found, even in those admitted facts, the accused to have exceeded in his right of self-defence and convicted him accordingly. In Sattar referred above the accused while explaining the circumstances in which he inflicted injuries to him, claimed to have acted in the exercise of right of self-defence. But the High 46 see Jagdeo v. Emperor, 38 IC 740. 47 Bhola Nath v. Emperor, AIR 1929 Allahabad 1. 48 Gul Mahomed v. Emperor, AIR 1945 Sindh 42. 49 Muhammad Azam v. State, PLJ 2009 SC 1120. Crl.A No.154-L/2013 etc. 16 Court though accepted his statement of facts in its entirety, but convicted him under section 304-I PPC by treating his version not to fit in the legal requirement of the valid exercise of right of selfdefence as the accused as per his own version of facts had chased the deceased in street who was attempting to escape from the place of occurrence. Summary of principles of law regarding article 121, QSO and section 342 Cr.P.C, 23. We consider it appropriate to recapitulate and summarise key principles of law discussed in this judgment, regarding article 121, QSO and section 342, Cr.P.C., for convenience, which are stated as under: i. The burden, in a criminal case, to prove the guilt of the accused is always on the prosecution. Therefore, the court, in the first instance, is to discuss and assess the prosecution evidence, in order to arrive at the conclusion as to whether or not the prosecution has succeeded in proving the charge against the accused on the basis of its evidence. ii. In a case where the accused has not taken any specific plea e.g. self defence, grave and sudden provocation etc. or has not produced any evidence in his defence, the court should decide the question of success or failure of the prosecution in proving the charge against the accused on the basis of the prosecution evidence alone. iii. In a case where the accused has taken a specific plea or has produced evidence in his defence, the court should appraise the prosecution case and the defense version in juxtaposition, in order to arrive at a just conclusion. Even in such situation the burden remains on the prosecution to prove the necessary ingredients of the offence charged against the accused, and it does not shift upon the accused merely by taking a defence plea or producing evidence in his defence. Crl.A No.154-L/2013 etc. 17 vi. vii. viii. The burden shifts upon the accused under Article 121 of the QSO to prove his defense plea, only when a prima facie case is made out against him by the prosecution on the basis of its evidence. If the prosecution fails to prove its case against the accused, the question of shifting of burden on the accused does not arise. The primary purpose of section 342 Cr.P.C. is to enable the accused to know and to explain and respond to the evidence brought against him by the prosecution. A direct dialogue is established between the Court and the accused by putting every important incriminating piece of evidence to the accused and granting him an opportunity to answer and explain. If the prosecution fails to prove its case against the accused, the court can take into consideration the statement of the accused under section 342 Cr.P.C. whether in favour of or against the accused; but it must take into consideration that statement in its entirety and cannot select and place reliance on the inculpatory part of the statement only. In the last mentioned circumstance, the facts narrated by the accused in his statement under section 342 Cr.P.C. are to be accepted without requiring their proof. The court, however, should examine the said facts in order to give due effect to them under the law. The object of such examination is to determine whether or not the facts narrated by the accused constitute an offence under the law or fit into any exception of the offence provided under the law. An admission or confession made in statement under section 342 Cr.P.C., which is improbable or unbelievable, or is not consistent with the overall facts and circumstances of a case do not have any probative value and thus it cannot be relied upon by the court for reaching a conclusion. 24. The above settled principles of law when applied to the present case, we find that the prosecution has failed to prove the Crl.A No.154-L/2013 etc. 18 case against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt, on the basis of its evidence. We, therefore, revert to the defense plea and the statement of the appellant made under section 342 Cr.P.C., which is to be accepted in its entirety without requiring the proof under Article 121, QSO. The appellant, in his statement under section 342 Cr.P.C., has explained that he killed his sister and her paramour on grave and sudden provocation as he saw them committing zina when entered in his house at 03:00 am in the night, on his return from the hospital. His statement is not improbable or unbelievable, nor is it inconsistent with the overall facts and circumstances of the case; therefore, it can safely be relied and acted upon. Our culture and social values reflected in the jurisprudence developed so far is that an act of illicit sex with a female family member of the offender is considered sufficient to cause provocation so grave and sudden that it would deprive the offender of the power of self-control. The arguments on behalf of the complainant have been made only to convince this Court to believe the prosecution story, though they could not succeed; and it has not even been argued that the facts and circumstances narrated by the appellant under which he committed the murder of Raheel Arif, if admitted to be correct, do not constitute grave and sudden provocation. In the light of the scope and meaning of grave and sudden provocation discussed in para 13 above, the statement of the appellant when taken as a whole, establishes grave and sudden provocation. The case of the appellant to the extent of murder of Raheel Arif, therefore, falls within the scope of section 302 c P.P.C; hence, his appeal is partly allowed to the extent of the impugned judgment of the High Court. The judgment of the High Court whereby the appellant was convicted under section 302 b PPC for the murder of Raheel Arif is set aside, while that of the Trial Court convicting the appellant under section 302 c PPC is 50 See Muhammad Qasim v. State, PLD 2018 SC 840; Gul Nissa v. Muhammad Yousuf, PLD 2006 SC 556; Naseer Hussain v. Nawaz, 1994 SCMR 1504; Noor Muhammad v. State, 1993 SCMR 208; and cases referred to in paras 18 and 19 of this judgment. Crl.A No.154-L/2013 etc. 19 restored. However, the sentence of the appellant is modified. The appellant is sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for a period of 15 years, in the peculiar circumstances of the case. He is also directed to pay compensation of Rs.100,000/- one hundred thousand to the legal heirs of the deceased, in terms of section 544-A, Code of Criminal Procedure, and in default whereof to undergo simple imprisonment for six months. Benefit of Section 382-B, Code of Criminal Procedure is extended to the appellant. Consequently, criminal petition for leave to appeal filed by the complainant for enhancement of the sentence of the appellant from life imprisonment to death is dismissed for being without merit and leave to appeal is refused. 25.

him at the clinic.", "At the end of one of his visits to the clinic on 23.04.2006, the appellant, around 2:15 am, requested Raheel Arif, nephew of the complainant, to walk him home from the clinic.", "Around 3:00 am, the same night, the complainant, who was also at the clinic, went out to drop Hassan Iftikhar PW-12 and Adeel Arif brother of Raheel Arif home on his motorbike.", "The complainant

succumbed to his injuries and died in the street.", "The crime report continues to state that thereafter the appellant went into the house and locked the door and more fire shots were heard from inside the house.", "According to prosecution the motive behind the murder was that the appellant suspected that Raheel Arif had illicit relations with his sister Rabia Khalil.", "The defence version, as per statement of the appellant recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C, is that he murdered the deceased and his sister due to grave and sudden provocation when he saw his sister in a compromising position with the deceased, as he returned home from medical clinic in the wee hours of the night on 23.4.2006.", "We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have examined the record and the judgments of the courts below.", "The trial court disbelieved the presence of the eye-witnesses, the complainant, Ali Ahmad PW-11 and Hassan Iftikhar PW-12 at the site of the occurrence after a

"According to the site plan the complainant party saw the occurrence from a distance of 297 feet, in the dead of the night.", "There is a contradiction between the statements of the two eye-witnesses PW-11 PW-12 regarding their distance from the site of occurrence, PW-12 categorically stated in his cross-examination that he was present during the occurrence at a distance of 14/15 feet from the place of occurrence, while PW-11 supports the site plan which describes the distance to be 297 feet.", "This inconsistency between the statement of the two eye-witnesses casts doubt on the case of the

motorcycle was recovered.", "Adeel Arif, one of the three eyewitnesses, being the real brother of the deceased and as a consequence being the most aggrieved amongst them, was given up by the prosecution as being unnecessary, giving rise to an adverse inference regarding his presence at the scene of the crime.", "The above analysis makes the presence of the eye-witnesses at the crime scene doubtful, as concluded by the trial court.", "With the presence of the eye-witnesses doubtful at the scene of the crime, it is not safe to place reliance on the ocular account.", "As a consequence, the medical evidence or the recovery of the firearm from the appellant lends little support or corroboration, to the case of the prosecution.", "For the above reasons we are of the view that the prosecution failed to establish the culpability of the appellant, on the basis of its evidence.", "The High Court did not examine the case of the prosecution and appraise its evidence to find out whether the prosecution had succeeded to prove the charge against the accused but instead, examined only the defence plea by placing reliance on Article 121 of the Qanun-e-Shahdat Order, 1984 QSO and held that the appellant had failed to prove his plea of grave and sudden provocation as taken in his statement under section 342 Cr.P.C and proceeded to convict him under section 302 b PPC for the offence of honour killing , as alleged by the prosecution.", "Process of appraising evidence and scope of Article 121 of QSO 8.", "In a criminal trial, it is now jurisprudentially wellentrenched, the

Akhtar Ali, AOR\n\nFor the Respondent(s) : Syed M. Ayub Bokhari, ASC\nMr. Mehmood A. Sheikh, AOR\n\n1) Date of Hearing \"ss : 25.11.2019\nJudgment\n\ni Sajjad Ali Shah, J. The appellant, through instant appeal, has\n\nchallenged the concurrent findings of the two Courts below rejecting the\nappellant’s assertion that her sister late Mst. Anwar Sultan by faith was a\n‘Sunni’ Muslim and her succession was to be opened accordingly. Leave was\ngranted by this Court on 27.9.2013 to examine the appellant’s claim that the\nappellate as well as the revisional Courts were mainly influenced by the\nstatement of Mst. Anwar Sultan recorded in previous proceedings declaring\nherself to be a ‘Shia’ Muslim notwithstanding the fact that in those\n\nproceedings the. sect of her son was being determined and her statement\n\nregarding her son’s sect was even not accepted by the Court.\n\n2.0 Briefly, on the death of Mst. Anwar Sultan, her entire property\n‘after necessary inquiry on the revenue side was transferred in the name of\nher only daughter Mst. Qamar Sultan the respondent herein, on the ground\n\nthat deceased professed ‘Shia’ faith. The present appellant who is real sister\n\nof the deceased Mst. Anwar Sultan being aggrieved with such declaration of\n\n4\nGeena\n\n\ni\ni\ni\nA\ni\n}\n\nCA 1241 of 2013 2\n\nher sister’s faith and transfer of her entire property in favour of her only\ndaughter filed a suit seeking cancellation of those mutation entries and her\n‘a2 share in the Property of the deceased on the ground that deceased\nprofessed ‘Sunni’ faith. The suit, after a full dressed trial, was decreed by\ndeclaring that deceased Mst. Anwar Sultan professed ‘Sunni’ faith.\nConsequently, mutation entries of inheritance in the sole name of her\ndaughter by treating her as ‘Shia’ were declared illegal. In appeal, the\njudgment of the trial Court was reversed and the High Court while exercising\nrevisional jurisdiction maintained the findings of the appellate Court.\n\n3. Mr. Muhammad Munir Paracha learned counsel appearing for\nthe appellant contended that the appellate as well as the revisional Courts\nhave erred by relying on the previous statement of the deceased Mst. Anwar\nSultan regarding her faith which was inadmissible and was hit by Section 47 |\nof the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. Counsel further while placing\n\nreliance on the judgment of this Court ini the case of Pathana versus Mst.\n\nWasai and another (PLD 1965 SC 134) contends that in the Indo-Pak Sub-\n\ncontinent there is the initial presumption that a Muslim is governed by\nHanafi Law, unless the contrary is established and the respondent miserably\nfailed to establish through independent and reliable evidence that the\ndeceased Mst. Anwar Sultan was ‘Shiq’ by faith. It was next contended that\nit has come on record that in the previous litigation her son was treated as\n‘Sunni’ and further that her son in law was also ‘Sunni’ by faith. It was lastly\ncontended that the evidence further reflects that the funeral prayers of the\ndeceased were led by ‘Sunni’ Imam, therefore, per counsel there was no legal\njustification available with the appellant as well as revisional Court to\n\nreverse the judgment of the trial Court.\n\n4 On the other hand, learned counsel appearing for respondent\n\ncontended that no amount of evidence whatsoever could be preferred on the\nStatement of the deceased who herself on oath in the previous proceedings\n\ndeclared herself to be ‘Shia’ by faith. Counsel further referred to Zad-ul-\n\nAy wd\n\n\n‘|\n\nCA 1241 of 2013 3\n\nmiyad by Allama Hafiz Ibn-e-Qayyam and cited an instance the gist whereof\nis that one of the Ashab viz. Hazrat Usama (© ei ail 44) killed a pagan after\nhe recited.Kalma-e-Tayyaba. Our Holy Prophet (42) showed displeasure.\nConsequently, Hazrat Usama (~© iii all 2) said that he recited Kalma-e-\nTayyaba just to save his life and the Holy Prophet (44) responded that did\nyou open and see his heart. The Holy Prophet (.22) further said that on the\nday of judgment who would help you against Kalma-e-Tayyaba. The ASC\nconsequently contended that in the matter of faith a person statement has to\nbe believed and given preference over other evidence. Learned counsel\nfurther referred to Ayat Number 94 from Sura-e-Nisa where it has been\nordained that:\n\n“O ye who believe! When ye go forth (to fight) in the way of Allah,\n\nbe careful to discriminate, and say not unto one who offereth you\n\npeace : ‘Thou art not a believer,’ seeking the chance profits of this\n\nlife (so that ye may despoil him). With Allah are plenteous spoils. ~\n\nEven thus (as he now is) were ye before; but Allah hath since\n\nthen been gracious unto you. Therefore take care to discriminate.\n\nAllah is ever Aware of what ye do” .\n5. In the circumstances it was argued that no better evidence than\nthat of the deceased could be considered to decide her faith. It was next\ncontended that even one of the witnesses of the plaintiff has admitted that\nAlam of Hazrat Abbas (© visi al! 44) was hoisted at the house of the\n\ndeceased. Counsel contended that even this Court in the case of Mst.\n\nGhulam Ayesha alias Ilyas Begum vs. Sardar Sher Khan (PLJ 2006 SC 1476)\n\nhas acceded to the fact that the flying of Alam of Hazrat Abbas (~© lle 4i/4)\nis a strong indication of one being of “Shia” faith. Counsel while strongly\ndenying the proposition that in Indo-Pak, the initial presumption ee\na Muslim being of “Sunni” faith, contended that in the case of Muhammad\nBashir vs. Latifa Bibi (2010 SCMR 1915) this Court has laid down that no\nprinciple of universal application is available to determine faith of a person\nwhich depends on surrounding circumstances, way of life, parental faith\n\nand faith of kith and kin.\n\nay,\n\n\nCA 1241 of 2013 4\n\n6. We have heard the learned counsel for the respective parties\nand have thoroughly examined the record as well as the case law cited at\n\nbar. No doubt the Courts below while determining the faith of the deceased\n\nar\n\nheavily relied upon her statenrent recorded in some previous proceedings in\nwhich she declared herself to be “Shia” however, such statement according\nto Mr. Paracha ASC was inadmissible in terms of Article 46 and 47 of the\nQanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. It is to be noted that Article 46 specifies\nthe cases in which statement of relevant fact by person who is dead or\ncannot be found etc. is relevant, whereas Article 47 narrates the relevancy\nof certain evidence, for proving in subsequent proceeding, the truth of facts\ntherein stated. The minute examination of these provisions would reflect\nthat these provisions are based on principles exempting direct evidence in\ncertain cases and on meeting certain conditions allow the use of indirect or\nhearsay evidence without the opportunity of cross-examination. However,\nin our opinion none of the Article applies to the facts and circumstances of\nthe case for the simple reason that the Courts below did not relied/ adopted\nthe statement/testimony, of the deceased in respect of the controversy in\nrespect whereof the statement was recorded which otherwise would have\nbeen hit by the principles of hearsay unless its justification could be found\nin terms of the subject Articles. In fact the controversy with regard to\nprevious testimony was the faith of her son whereas the controversy in\nhand is the faith of the deceased herself. In case her statement was to be\nused in any other proceeding in respect of a portion of a controversy which\nrequired cross examination keeping in mind the controversy subject matter\nof the proceedings in hand then of course such statement could not be\naccepted by the Court unless it had met the threshold laid down by\nSection 46 & 47 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. However, the\nquestion before us is the voluntary declaration by the deceased regarding\nher own faith which she declared while deposing with regard to a different\n\nissue and we see no reason to disbelieve the declaration of deceased in\n\nNp\n\n\nCA 1241 of 2013 5\n\nrespect of her own faith which neither was challenged nor it could\nsuccessfully be challenged even if one is allowed to cross examine the\nperson-who declares his/her faith. It is also of utmost importance that on\nfactual plane the veracity of the statement of the deceased wherein she\ndeclared her faith through out has not been challenged. It is not the case of\nthe appellant that the deceased did not appear in a witness box or she did\nnot on oath declared herself to be “Shia” by faith. There could be no better\nevidence made available to the Court then the declaration of such person to\nresolve the controversy regarding his/her faith. It is also to be kept i in mind\nthat the question of faith being very personal to oneself anda a of\nfaith by one has to be. accepted on its face value which, of course, is not\nopen to challenge from anyone, therefore, such voluntary declaration even\nif made in some previous proceeding is of great persuasive value after the\ndeath of such person and, therefore, could be validly used in the\nsubsequently instituted Proceedings to determine the faith of such person.\nIn the circumstances we are of the view that neither the bar as pleaded\napplies to such declaration nor it could be discarded.\nVi As to submission of Mr. Paracha ASC regarding initial\npresumption of once faith as being “Sunni”, no doubt that this Court has\nruled by keeping in mind the rule of majority that in Indo-Pak Sub-\ncontinent majority of Muslims are “Sunni” by faith, therefore, there is initial\npresumption that the parties to the proceedings are “Sunni”, however, such\n\ninitial presumption is rebuttable and for this reason this Court in the case\n\nof Muhammad Bashir (supra) held that no principle of universal application ©\nis available to determine the faith of a person which should be determined\nkeeping in view the surrounding circumstances, the way of life, the parental\nfaith and faith of other kith and kin. Consequently once the faith of person\nis challenged the question of the initial presumption looses its sanctity and\n\nis to inferred a2 the facts creating presumption or the surrounding\n\ncircumstances one way or the or\n\nS te\nSe\n\n\nCA 1241 of 2013 e P - 6\n\n8. The other important piece of evidence which persuaded the\nCourt in deciding the faith of deceased was the hoisting of Alam of Hazrat\nAbbas (~#'Z4ke7 4) 2) atthe house of the deceased. This fact was admitted\nby none other than plaintiffs own witness Khizar Hayat (PW-2) during cross\nexamination and we have no hesitation in concurring with the observations\n\nmade by this Court in the case of Mst. Ghulam Ayesha alias Iyas Begum\n\n(supra) that such act, of course, was a strong indication of the fact that the\n\nresident of the house was “Shia” by faith. It is also interesting to note that\n\nthe plaintiff who claims to be a “Sunni” by faith choose not to appear in the\n\nwitness box and one of her sons who appeared as her Attorney declared\n\nhimself to be “Shia” by faith. Even if we without drawing an adverse\n\ninference accept this statement as its face value then this fact alone is a\nstrong indication of the fact that the eaniily of the deceased comprised of\npeople having both “Shia” and “Sunni” faith.\n\n9. It is also very strange and intriguing that the plaintiff's\n\nAttorney despite his close relation with the deceased (nephew) showed\n\nignorance but did not deny two very important facts; firstly, that Alam of\n\nHazrat Abbas (~© ‘elles all gyda) was hoisted on the house of deceased and;\nsecondly, that deceased used to hold “Majlis” at her house. He also\nadmitted that he used to visit Dharnaal where the deceased resided and\nthat there was no “Shia” Mosque and the “Shia” used to pray at the “Sunni”\nMosque. The non denial of this suggestion in the peculiar circumstances of\nthe case where the witness himself claimed to be of “Shia” faith amounts to\nadmission of fact.\n\n10. In these. peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, we are\nof the view that the two Courts below have rightly evaluated the evidence on\nrecord in coming to the conclusion that the deceased was “Shia” ‘by faith\nand we see no reason to interfere with such concurrent findings of fact and,\n\ntherefore, would dismiss this appeal.\n\n\n“hee CA 1241 0f 2013 7\n\\\n\nVy . 11. These are the reasons of our short order of even date which\n\nwas in the following terms:-\n\n“For the reasons to be recorded later, this appeal is dismissed\n\nbut with rio order as to costs”.\n\nIslamabad, the\n25th November, 2019\nA.

In the year 1950,\na school was also established on a portion of the said wagqf\n\nproperty and subsequently, in 1960, the Chief Administrator Auqaf\n\n1 Vide mutation dated 03.07.1908\n\nCP No.522-L/2013, etc. 2\n\ntook over the said wagqf property under the erstwhile Punjab Waqf\n\nProperties Ordinance, 1959 vide notification dated 23.05.1960. An\n\namended schedule of the said wagf property was issued on\n\n24.07.1973 under the Punjab Waqf Properties Ordinance, 1979\n\n(“Ordinance”) showing the total area of land constituting waqf\n\nproperty as 202 acres and 4 marlas.\n\n2. The question before us is the legality of the grant of\nlease of waqf property (4 kanals) by the Chief Administrator Auqgaf\nto the petitioner for setting up a petrol pump, on a monthly rent of\nRs. 4,000/- per month for a period of 30 years. The descendants\nof the original dedicator (waqif) challenged the said grant through\na constitutional petition, on the ground that the lease offends the\nobject of the wagf and is violative of the provisions of the\nOrdinance and the Rules framed thereunder. The High Court set\naside the grant of lease for setting up a petrol pump vide judgment\ndated 10.02.2010 holding that the trust property could not lawfully\nbe given to the petitioner for establishment of a petrol pump, the\ngrant of lease for 30 years is illegal and the land in question being\na playground attached to a school cannot be put to a different use.\nThe Division Bench of the High Court upheld the judgment in\nappeal vide impugned Order dated 29.01.2013. Hence, the instant\n\npetitions.\n\n3. Learned counsel for the petitioners vehemently argued\nthat the department enjoys the power under the Ordinance and the\n\nPunjab Wagqf Properties (Administration) Rules, 2002 (“Rules”) to\n\nlease out a portion of waqf property for setting up a petrol pump\n\nCP No.522-L/2013, etc. 3\n\nand the department has fully complied with the Rules for doing so\n\nand prayed that the judgment of the Courts below be set aside.\n\n4. On the other hand, learned counsel for the\nrespondents have argued that lease of the waqf property for setting\nup a petrol pump offends the provisions of the Ordinance and the\nRules. Besides, it is also against public interest as a petrol pump is\nbeing proposed to be set up in a_ playground which is adjacent to\n\na school. He supported the judgments of the Courts below.\n\n5. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties at\nsome length and have gone through the record and the law on the\nsubject. The legal questions involved in the case are whether a part\nof waqf property can be leased out for commercial purposes? And if\nso, what is the mode, manner and procedure available to the Chief\nAdministrator Augaf for sanctioning such a lease under the\nOrdinance and the Rules? In order to meaningfully answer the\nabove legal questions, we need to first consider the concept of waqf\nin Islam; its historical importance; its purpose and utility today\nand the scope of administration and development of wadqf\n\nproperties by the Chief Administrator Auqaf under the Ordinance.\n\nWagf: meaning and concept\n\n6. Waqdf and its plural form, augaf, are derived from the\nArabic root verb, waqafa, which means “to stop” or “to hold.”?\nWhen the word is employed in a legal sense with regard to a piece\nof land or a building, it signifies that henceforth that “property” is\n\n“stopped.” In theory, it can never again change hands by\n\n2H. Wehr, A Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic, 1091-1094.\n\n\nCP No.522-L/2013, etc. 4\n\ninheritance, sale or seizure. An individual creating a waqf, known\nin Arabic as the “waqif,” divests him or herself of the formal rights\nto possession, but retains the power to appoint a custodian i.e., a\n“mutawali’ (literally “one who is trusted”), who manages the\nproperty dedicated’. Waqdf is an inalienable trust+ and is the\ngranting or dedication of property in trust for a pious purpose.®\nD.F. Mullah, in his compilation of principles of Muhammadan Law,\nhas defined “waqf’ to mean the permanent dedication by a person\nprofessing the Mussalman [Muslim] faith of any property for any\npurpose recognized by the Mussalman law as religious, pious or\ncharitable.” “Waqf signifies the extinction of the proprietor’s\nownership in the thing dedicated and the detention of the thing in\nthe implied ownership of God, in such a manner that its profits\nmay revert to or be applied for the benefit of mankind.” “Waqf\nProperty” is defined in section 2(e) of the Ordinance in the following\nmanner:-\n“Waqf Property means property of any kind\npermanently dedicated by a person professing Islam for any\n\npurpose recognized by Islam as religious pious, or\ncharitable...\n\nOrigins of Waqf in Islam\n\n7. Although the word “waqdf” is not specifically mentioned\nin the Holy Quran, yet there are many verses® which inspire\n\nMuslims to donate and give charity, to obtain piety, righteousness\n\n3 Gregory C.

A\nhadith quoted by Hazrat Abu Hurairah(Allah be pleased with him)\nis usually referred by the Islamic scholars as the basis of the\ninstitution of “wagf’ in Islam. He reported Allah’s Messenger,\nMohammad (may peace be upon him) as saying: “when a man dies,\nall his acts come to an end, but three; recurring charity, or\nknowledge (by which people) benefit, or a pious son who prays for\nhim (for the deceased)9.” Waqf is the best form of a continuous\ncharity as the dedicated property earns for the dedicators\ncontinuous good deeds even after his death. It is this\nunderstanding that motivates the Muslims to promote this\nreligious social-welfare institution. Syed Ameer Ali, a great judge\nand jurist of the subcontinent (Indo-Pak) speaking for the Judicial\nCommittee of the Privy Council in the case of Vidya Varuthi v.\n\nBlusami (AIR 1922 PC 123) observed:\n\n“13. But the Mahommedan law relating to trusts differs\nfundamentally from the English law. It owes its origin to a rule\nlaid down by the Prophet of Islam; and means \"the tying up of\nproperty in the ownership of God the Almighty and the devotion of\nthe profits for the benefit of human beings.\" When once it is\ndeclared that a particular property is wakf, or any such\nexpression is used as implies wakf, or the tenor of the document\nshows, ... that a dedication to pious or charitable purposes is\nmeant, the right of the wakif is extinguished and the ownership is\ntransferred to the Almighty............ ” (emphasis underlined)\n\n8. Hazrat Ibn-e-Umar (may Allah be pleased with him)\nreported: “Umar acquired a land at Khaibar. He came to Allah's\nApostle (may peace be upon him) and sought his advice in regard\nto it. He said: Allah's Messenger, I have acquired land in Khaibar. I\n\nhave never acquired property more valuable for me than this, so\n\n9 Sahih Muslim, Vol-III, Kitab al-Wassiya, Hadith-4005 (Translated by Abdul\nHamid Siddiqi, 1973)\n\nCP No.522-L/2013, etc. 6\n\nwhat do you command me to do with it? Thereupon he (Allah's\nMessenger) said: If you like, you may keep the corpus intact and\ngive its produce as Sadaqa. So, Umar gave it as Sadaqa declaring\nthat property must not be sold or inherited or given away as gift.\nAnd Umar devoted it to the poor, to the nearest kin, and to the\nemancipation of slaves, and in the way of Allah and\nguests........0... 710. Thus, these two traditions of the Holy Prophet\n(peace be upon him) are commonly considered providing the\n\nexpress basis for the emergence of waqf in Islam.\n\nRole of Waqf in the development of Islamic Civilization\n\n9. It is not an exaggeration to claim that the waqf created\nin perpetuity has provided foundation for much of what is\nconsidered “Islamic civilization.!!” Wagf fulfilled a crucial gap\nbetween the resources available with an emerging State and the\nneed of a growing community in the early days of Islam, and in the\nlater years became a main source for various public services. The\nWaqf contributed to the building of Islamic civilisation; through\nwhich many mosques, schools, and educational centres were built\nalong with libraries, scientific research centres and other fields in\ndifferent walks of life. Throughout the history of the Islamic world,\nsuch settlements provided for many of the spiritual and temporal\nwants of Muslims.!2 Wagqf played an important role in establishing\na flourishing civilization. It created a comprehensive scientific and\n\ncultural renaissance. These funds were the main resource for\n\n10 Sahih Muslim, Vol-III, Kitab al-Wassiya, Hadith-4006 (Translated by Abdul\nHamid Siddiqi, 1973)\n\n11 Peter C. Hennigan.

Therefore, Waqf is described as the most important\ninstitution which provided the foundation for Islamic civilization as\nit was interwoven with the entire religious life and the social\neconomy of Muslims. It covered almost all the needs of life during\nthe early period of Islamic civilization; encompassing health,\neducation, basic infrastructures, business and commercial\nactivities, job creation, food provision for the hungry and livestock,\nshelter provision for the poor and needy, and supporting the\nagricultural and industrial sectors without any cost to the\ngovernment!’. Wagqf is in fact a comprehensive mechanism of\npublic finance that is capable of bringing upon economic progress\n\nas well as social development.\n\n10. With this religious and historical perspective of waqf\nin Islam, we now proceed to examine the legal framework regarding\nthe administration and management of the waqf properties under\n\nthe Ordinance and the Rules.\n\nScheme of law under the Ordinance and the Rules\n\n11. The preambular purpose of the Ordinance is to provide\nfor the proper management and administration of waqf properties\nin the Province of the Punjab. Wadf property is defined!* to mean\nany kind of property permanently dedicated by a person professing\n\nIslam for any purpose recognized by Islam as religious, pious or\n\n13 See Baqutayan, et al.

Property used for the relief of the poor and the\norphans, education, workshop, medical relief, maintenance of\nshrines or for any other object of charitable, religious or pious\nnature or of general public utility is deemed to be charitable\npurposes under the Ordinance.!5 The income from boxes placed at\nshrines and offerings, subscriptions or articles presented at the\nshrine and property permanently dedicated for the purposes of\nmosque, shrine, takia, khankah, dargah is deemed to be waqf\nproperty.

Chief Administrator Augaf enjoys\nthe power to take over and assume the administration, control,\n\nmanagement and maintenance of the waqf property.!§\n\n12. Under section 15 of the Ordinance, the Chief\nAdministrator Auqaf, is to settle schemes for the administration\nand development of a waqf property and through the settlement of\nschemes the Chief Administrator is to give effect to such wishes of\nthe waqif, as can be ascertained, and to which effect can be\n\nreasonably given. Under the Punjab  Waqf Properties\n\n(Administration) Rules, 2002, (“Rules 2002”) the Chief\n\nAdministrator Auqaf, after taking control of the waqf property\n\nappoints a Manager to administer, control, manage and maintain\n\n15 Id. Explanation 6 to section 2(e).\n16 Id. section 3\n\n17 Id. section 4\n\n18 Id. section 7 ibid\n\nCP No.522-L/2013, etc. 9\n\nthe waqf property on behalf of the Chief Administrator. The\nManager is to prepare scheme for the waqf property to be settled by\nthe Chief Administrator. The scheme must honour the wishes of\nthe wakif, as can be ascertained and in the absence of any\nevidence, the waqf property shall be used for the purpose for which\nit has been used or for any purpose recognized by Islam as\n\nreligious, pious or charitable.\n\n13. Under section 17, there are two broad purposes for\nutilization of the waqf property; (i) the purpose for which it (waqf\nproperty) was dedicated or has been used; and (ii) for any (other)\npurpose recognized by Islam as religious, pious or charitable, as\nthe Chief Administrator may deem fit. The Chief Administrator\nAugaf is to maintain a complete record of all the properties under\nhis control and management and keep accounts of income and\nexpenditure of such properties including expenditure on the Chief\nAdministrator and his establishment. All moneys are credited to a\nfund, called Augqaf Fund, which is under the control of and\noperated upon by the Chief Administrator subject to general\nsupervision of the Government. The accounts maintained by the\nChief Administrator are to be audited at the end of each financial\nyear and the Audit Report with the comments of the Chief\nAdministrator is to be laid before the Government!9. The Punjab\n\nWaaqf Properties (Accounts) Rules, 1982 provide that the Augqaf\n\nFund shall be audited once a year by the Local Fund Audit\n\nDepartment of the Government.\n\n19 Id. section 18\n\nCP No.522-L/2013, etc. 10\n\n14. Sections 9 and 19 of the Ordinance recognise that the\nwaqf property can be put out on lease as section 9 provides for\ntermination of lease and resumption of tenancy in cases of breach\nof the agreement and section 19 deals with recovery of rent or lease\nmoney as arrears of land revenue in case of default. While Rule 7\nof the Rules 2002 framed under section 26(2)(c) specifically deals\nwith terms and conditions on which waqf property may be leased\nout. However, any lease of waqf property shall be a part of the\nscheme approved by the Chief Administrator Auqaf and the\n“directions” given in Rule 7 are to be read as part of the scheme.\nThe period of lease shall be for one year and not more than three\nyears but can be extended for another two years with the approval\nof Chief Administrator Augaf. Lease can also be granted for a\nlonger period if Chief Administrator Augqaf is of the opinion that it\n\nis in the best interest of the waqf property.\n\nOpinion\n\n15. One of the core statutory obligations?° of the Chief\nAdministrator Auqaf is to settle a Scheme for the administration\n\nand _ development of the waqf property. In settling a scheme the\n\nChief Administrator Augaf is to honour the wishes of the waqif, as\ncan be ascertained and to which effect can be given reasonably.?!\nOtherwise, the Scheme is to advance purposes recognized by Islam\nas religious, pious or charitable.2? Relief of poor and the orphans,\n\neducation, workshop, medical relief, maintenance of shrines or the\n\n20 where gross annual income from the waqf property exceeds Rs 5,000/-, which\nis so in the instant case.\n\n21 Td. section 15(2)\n\n22 Id. section 17\n\nCP No.522-L/2013, etc. 11\n\nadvancement of any other object of charitable, religious or pious\nnature or of general public utility are deemed to be charitable\npurposes under the Ordinance.?° Under the Rules 2002, the Chief\nAdministrator Auqaf after taking over and assuming the\nadministration of a waqf property appoints a Manager to\nadminister, control, manage and maintain the waqf property. It is\nthe Manager who prepares a scheme for the administration and\ndevelopment of the waqf property under his charge. The scheme is\nthen submitted to the Chief Administrator Augqaf, who may settle\nor refuse to settle or return the scheme for reconsideration or may\ncall for the further details or information about the scheme or\n\ndirect any further examination of the scheme as he may consider‘.\n\n16. The administration and development of waqf property\nby the Chief Administrator Augaf under the Ordnance is, therefore,\nthrough the mode and mechanism of schemes, with the singular\nobject of advancing and maximizing the wishes of the wakif or the\nreligious, pious and charitable purposes recognized by Islam. A\nscheme under section 15 of the Ordinance is, therefore, a strategic\nplan, a road map, a financial feasibility or a business plan for the\nadministration and development of the waqf property, driven and\ndirected by the objectives settled by the wakif or as given under the\nlaw. While the word “administration” in section 15, signifies the\noverall control, management and maintenance of the waqf\n\nproperties, the expression “development?” is of much more\n\n23 Id. Explanation 6 to section 2(e)\n\n24The Rules, 2002. Rules 4 and 5\n\n25 The word “development” has been added in the Ordinance, 1979 and was not\nthere in the corresponding section 11 of West Pakistan Waqf Properties\nOrdinance, 1961.\n\nCP No.522-L/2013, etc. 12\n\nsignificance and enjoins upon the Chief Administrator Augqaf to\nexpand, evolve and enlarge the scope of charitable work of the waqf\nwith changing times. The scheme to be settled by the Chief\nAdministrator Augqaf must not only carry a plan of action or a\nprogramme for the administration of the waqf properties but also\nthe stratagem and vision for its development, evolution and future\ngrowth. The Chief Administrator Auqaf must consider, at all time,\nthe best use of the waqf property is to achieve its noble objectives,\nkeeping in view the needs of the time and that of an evolving\n\nsociety.\n\n17. The scheme, like any strategic or development plan\nhas to consider, evaluate and weigh the exiting status of the waqf\nproperties, the revenue generated, the expenditure incurred and\nmost importantly, the central theme of the scheme: the actual\nadvancement of the wishes of the waqif or the promotion of\nreligious, pious and charitable work or work of public utility for the\ncare and welfare of the society. The Chief Administrator Auqaf in\nsettling a scheme must not lose sight of this central objective of the\nscheme and must always remain cognizant of the historical\nsignificance of waqf and how it contributed to the building of\nIslamic civilization; through which many mosques, schools, and\neducational centres were built alongwith libraries, scientific\nresearch centres and other fields in different walks of life, which\ngave way to the training of many scientists, researchers, inventors,\nand intellectuals. The scheme is fundamentally for advancement\nof such causes and must justify, at all times, that the waqf\n\nproperty is being used to promote and expand the objectives\n\nCP No.522-L/2013, etc. 13\n\nmentioned above, improving and growing with time. The settling\nof scheme, therefore, goes to the root of effective administration\nand development of waqf property and is the central function of the\nChief Administrator Augaf under the Ordinance. To draw up a\nscheme, therefore, requires the Chief Administrator Auqaf to have\nsufficient expertise in management, administration, finance,\naccounts, marketing, planning, development, policy and in running\nof public charities. He should also be supported by informed and\nexpert recommendations of the qualified managers and\n\nadministrators appointed under the Ordinance.\n\n18. Maximization of charitable work requires a strong and\na growing revenue base, which can be generated through use or\nletting out of the immovable waqf property or by investments of\nmoneys collected from the waqf property (moveable waqf property).\nTherefore, waqf property can either be put to use to serve a\nreligious, pious or charitable cause directly i.e., by running and\nmanaging a shrine or a khanqgah or by establishing a school,\ncollege, university, hospital, research and training centres, etc for\nthe general public utility and welfare of the society, either free or at\nsubsidized rates; or indirectly, by leasing it out for purposes closer\nto the objectives of the waqf. Only as an exception and in the\nabsence of any viable option to lease the property out for purposes\ncloser to the objectives of the waqf, can the waqf property be leased\nout for commercial purposes. It is underlined that the Scheme\nmust weigh, evaluate and discuss alternatives when leasing out\nwaqf property and preference should always be given to lease out\n\nwaqf property for purposes that are more akin or close to the\n\nCP No.522-L/2013, etc. 14\n\nwishes of the wakif or the objectives given under the law, including\ncharitable purposes. Both the direct or indirect use of waqf\nproperty must be justified, in the manner discussed above, with\nreasons, to be laid out in the scheme that is to be settled and\nsanctioned by the Chief Administrator Auqaf.?° A deliberative and a\nwell-reasoned scheme shows structured exercise of discretion by\nthe Chief Administrator Auqaf, who is burdened with the sole\nauthority under the law, to settle the scheme for the\n\nadministration and development of the waqf property.\n\n19. In the present case, the proposal for grant of lease of 4\nkanals of waqf property for setting up of a petrol pump does not\nform part of a scheme as discussed above. In fact no scheme has\nbeen submitted with the Court. A summary put up for the lease of\nwagf property (as in the present case) to set-up a petrol pump in\nisolation of the other factors and considerations, without an overall\nplan or a road map, as discussed above, does not constitute a\nscheme, envisaged under the Ordinance. Questions like: why is the\nwaqf property required to be put on lease? why for a petrol pump\nand not for any other purpose more akin to the objectives of the\nwaqf? why for a meagre rental of Rs 4,000/- per month? and why\nfor a period of 30 years? why allegedly in a playground abutting a\nschool?

In the year 1950, a school was also established on a portion of the said wagqf property and subsequently, in 1960, the Chief Administrator Auqaf 1 Vide mutation dated 03.07.1908 CP No.522-L/2013, etc. 2 took over the said wagqf property under the erstwhile Punjab Waqf Properties Ordinance, 1959 vide notification dated 23.05.1960. An amended schedule of the said wagf property was issued on 24.07.1973 under the Punjab Waqf Properties Ordinance, 1979 Ordinance showing the total area of land constituting waqf property as 202 acres and 4 marlas. 2. The question before us is the legality of the grant of lease of waqf property 4 kanals by the Chief Administrator Auqgaf to the petitioner for setting up a petrol pump, on a monthly rent of Rs. 4,000/- per month for a period of 30 years. The descendants of the original dedicator waqif challenged the said grant through a constitutional petition, on the ground that the lease offends the object of the wagf and is violative of the provisions of the Ordinance and the Rules framed thereunder. The High Court set aside the grant of lease for setting up a petrol pump vide judgment dated 10.02.2010 holding that the trust property could not lawfully be given to the petitioner for establishment of a petrol pump, the grant of lease for 30 years is illegal and the land in question being a playground attached to a school cannot be put to a different use. The Division Bench of the High Court upheld the judgment in appeal vide impugned Order dated 29.01.2013. Hence, the instant petitions. 3. Learned counsel for the petitioners vehemently argued that the department enjoys the power under the Ordinance and the Punjab Wagqf Properties Administration Rules, 2002 Rules to lease out a portion of waqf property for setting up a petrol pump CP No.522-L/2013, etc. 3 and the department has fully complied with the Rules for doing so and prayed that the judgment of the Courts below be set aside. 4. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents have argued that lease of the waqf property for setting up a petrol pump offends the provisions of the Ordinance and the Rules. Besides, it is also against public interest as a petrol pump is being proposed to be set up in a playground which is adjacent to a school. He supported the judgments of the Courts below. 5. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties at some length and have gone through the record and the law on the subject. The legal questions involved in the case are whether a part of waqf property can be leased out for commercial purposes? And if so, what is the mode, manner and procedure available to the Chief Administrator Augaf for sanctioning such a lease under the Ordinance and the Rules? In order to meaningfully answer the above legal questions, we need to first consider the concept of waqf in Islam; its historical importance; its purpose and utility today and the scope of administration and development of wadqf properties by the Chief Administrator Auqaf under the Ordinance. Wagf: meaning and concept 6. Waqdf and its plural form, augaf, are derived from the Arabic root verb, waqafa, which means to stop or to hold. ? When the word is employed in a legal sense with regard to a piece of land or a building, it signifies that henceforth that property is stopped. In theory, it can never again change hands by 2H. Wehr, A Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic, 1091-1094. CP No.522-L/2013, etc. 4 inheritance, sale or seizure. An individual creating a waqf, known in Arabic as the waqif, divests him or herself of the formal rights to possession, but retains the power to appoint a custodian i.e., a mutawali literally one who is trusted , who manages the property dedicated . Waqdf is an inalienable trust and is the granting or dedication of property in trust for a pious purpose. D.F. Mullah, in his compilation of principles of Muhammadan Law, has defined waqf to mean the permanent dedication by a person professing the Mussalman Muslim faith of any property for any purpose recognized by the Mussalman law as religious, pious or charitable. Waqf signifies the extinction of the proprietor s ownership in the thing dedicated and the detention of the thing in the implied ownership of God, in such a manner that its profits may revert to or be applied for the benefit of mankind. Waqf Property is defined in section 2 e of the Ordinance in the following manner:- Waqf Property means property of any kind permanently dedicated by a person professing Islam for any purpose recognized by Islam as religious pious, or charitable... Origins of Waqf in Islam 7. Although the word waqdf is not specifically mentioned in the Holy Quran, yet there are many verses which inspire Muslims to donate and give charity, to obtain piety, righteousness 3 Gregory C.

CP No.522-L/2013, etc. 5 and fore mostly, the closeness and love of the Allah Almighty. A hadith quoted by Hazrat Abu Hurairah Allah be pleased with him is usually referred by the Islamic scholars as the basis of the institution of wagf in Islam. He reported Allah s Messenger, Mohammad may peace be upon him as saying: when a man dies, all his acts come to an end, but three; recurring charity, or knowledge by which people benefit, or a pious son who prays for him for the deceased 9. Waqf is the best form of a continuous charity as the dedicated property earns for the dedicators continuous good deeds even after his death. It is this understanding that motivates the Muslims to promote this religious social-welfare institution. Syed Ameer Ali, a great judge and jurist of the subcontinent Indo-Pak speaking for the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of Vidya Varuthi v. Blusami AIR 1922 PC 123 observed: 13. But the Mahommedan law relating to trusts differs fundamentally from the English law. It owes its origin to a rule laid down by the Prophet of Islam; and means the tying up of property in the ownership of God the Almighty and the devotion of the profits for the benefit of human beings. When once it is declared that a particular property is wakf, or any such expression is used as implies wakf, or the tenor of the document shows, ... that a dedication to pious or charitable purposes is meant, the right of the wakif is extinguished and the ownership is transferred to the Almighty............ emphasis underlined 8. Hazrat Ibn-e-Umar may Allah be pleased with him reported: Umar acquired a land at Khaibar. He came to Allah s Apostle may peace be upon him and sought his advice in regard to it. He said: Allah s Messenger, I have acquired land in Khaibar. I have never acquired property more valuable for me than this, so 9 Sahih Muslim, Vol-III, Kitab al-Wassiya, Hadith-4005 Translated by Abdul Hamid Siddiqi, 1973 CP No.522-L/2013, etc. 6 what do you command me to do with it? Thereupon he Allah s Messenger said: If you like, you may keep the corpus intact and give its produce as Sadaqa. So, Umar gave it as Sadaqa declaring that property must not be sold or inherited or given away as gift. And Umar devoted it to the poor, to the nearest kin, and to the emancipation of slaves, and in the way of Allah and guests........0... 710. Thus, these two traditions of the Holy Prophet peace be upon him are commonly considered providing the express basis for the emergence of waqf in Islam. Role of Waqf in the development of Islamic Civilization 9. It is not an exaggeration to claim that the waqf created in perpetuity has provided foundation for much of what is considered Islamic civilization.!! Wagf fulfilled a crucial gap between the resources available with an emerging State and the need of a growing community in the early days of Islam, and in the later years became a main source for various public services. The Waqf contributed to the building of Islamic civilisation; through which many mosques, schools, and educational centres were built along with libraries, scientific research centres and other fields in different walks of life. Throughout the history of the Islamic world, such settlements provided for many of the spiritual and temporal wants of Muslims.!2 Wagqf played an important role in establishing a flourishing civilization. It created a comprehensive scientific and cultural renaissance. These funds were the main resource for 10 Sahih Muslim, Vol-III, Kitab al-Wassiya, Hadith-4006 Translated by Abdul Hamid Siddiqi, 1973 11 Peter C. Hennigan. The Birth of a Legal InstitutionThe formation of the Waqf in the Third Century, Brill 2004 12 Gregory C. Kozlowski, Muslim Endowments and Society in British IndiaCambridge South Asian Studies. 1985 CP No.522-L/2013, etc. 7 schools, scientific centres and libraries, which gave way to the training of many scientists, researchers, inventors, and intellectuals. Therefore, Waqf is described as the most important institution which provided the foundation for Islamic civilization as it was interwoven with the entire religious life and the social economy of Muslims. It covered almost all the needs of life during the early period of Islamic civilization; encompassing health, education, basic infrastructures, business and commercial activities, job creation, food provision for the hungry and livestock, shelter provision for the poor and needy, and supporting the agricultural and industrial sectors without any cost to the government! . Wagqf is in fact a comprehensive mechanism of public finance that is capable of bringing upon economic progress as well as social development. 10. With this religious and historical perspective of waqf in Islam, we now proceed to examine the legal framework regarding the administration and management of the waqf properties under the Ordinance and the Rules. Scheme of law under the Ordinance and the Rules 11. The preambular purpose of the Ordinance is to provide for the proper management and administration of waqf properties in the Province of the Punjab. Wadf property is defined! to mean any kind of property permanently dedicated by a person professing Islam for any purpose recognized by Islam as religious, pious or 13 See Baqutayan, et al. Wagf Between the Past and Present. Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences. 9. 149-155. 2018 14 Punjab Waqf Properties Ordinance, 1979, section 2 e CP No.522-L/2013, etc. 8 charitable. Property used for the relief of the poor and the orphans, education, workshop, medical relief, maintenance of shrines or for any other object of charitable, religious or pious nature or of general public utility is deemed to be charitable purposes under the Ordinance.!5 The income from boxes placed at shrines and offerings, subscriptions or articles presented at the shrine and property permanently dedicated for the purposes of mosque, shrine, takia, khankah, dargah is deemed to be waqf property. All the waqf properties in the Province vest in the Chief Administrator of Auqaf for the Province appointed by the Government including all the rights, assets, debts, liabilities and obligations relating thereto.! Chief Administrator Auqaf is a corporation sole and enjoys perpetual succession and can sue or be sued in its corporate name! . Chief Administrator Augaf enjoys the power to take over and assume the administration, control, management and maintenance of the waqf property.! 12. Under section 15 of the Ordinance, the Chief Administrator Auqaf, is to settle schemes for the administration and development of a waqf property and through the settlement of schemes the Chief Administrator is to give effect to such wishes of the waqif, as can be ascertained, and to which effect can be reasonably given. Under the Punjab Waqf Properties Administration Rules, 2002, Rules 2002 the Chief Administrator Auqaf, after taking control of the waqf property appoints a Manager to administer, control, manage and maintain 15 Id. Explanation 6 to section 2 e . 16 Id. section 3 17 Id. section 4 18 Id. section 7 ibid CP No.522-L/2013, etc. 9 the waqf property on behalf of the Chief Administrator. The Manager is to prepare scheme for the waqf property to be settled by the Chief Administrator. The scheme must honour the wishes of the wakif, as can be ascertained and in the absence of any evidence, the waqf property shall be used for the purpose for which it has been used or for any purpose recognized by Islam as religious, pious or charitable. 13. Under section 17, there are two broad purposes for utilization of the waqf property; i the purpose for which it waqf property was dedicated or has been used; and ii for any other purpose recognized by Islam as religious, pious or charitable, as the Chief Administrator may deem fit. The Chief Administrator Augaf is to maintain a complete record of all the properties under his control and management and keep accounts of income and expenditure of such properties including expenditure on the Chief Administrator and his establishment. All moneys are credited to a fund, called Augqaf Fund, which is under the control of and operated upon by the Chief Administrator subject to general supervision of the Government. The accounts maintained by the Chief Administrator are to be audited at the end of each financial year and the Audit Report with the comments of the Chief Administrator is to be laid before the Government!9. The Punjab Waaqf Properties Accounts Rules, 1982 provide that the Augqaf Fund shall be audited once a year by the Local Fund Audit Department of the Government. 19 Id. section 18 CP No.522-L/2013, etc. 10 14. Sections 9 and 19 of the Ordinance recognise that the waqf property can be put out on lease as section 9 provides for termination of lease and resumption of tenancy in cases of breach of the agreement and section 19 deals with recovery of rent or lease money as arrears of land revenue in case of default. While Rule 7 of the Rules 2002 framed under section 26 2 c specifically deals with terms and conditions on which waqf property may be leased out. However, any lease of waqf property shall be a part of the scheme approved by the Chief Administrator Auqaf and the directions given in Rule 7 are to be read as part of the scheme. The period of lease shall be for one year and not more than three years but can be extended for another two years with the approval of Chief Administrator Augaf. Lease can also be granted for a longer period if Chief Administrator Augqaf is of the opinion that it is in the best interest of the waqf property. Opinion 15. One of the core statutory obligations? of the Chief Administrator Auqaf is to settle a Scheme for the administration and development of the waqf property. In settling a scheme the Chief Administrator Augaf is to honour the wishes of the waqif, as can be ascertained and to which effect can be given reasonably.?! Otherwise, the Scheme is to advance purposes recognized by Islam as religious, pious or charitable.2? Relief of poor and the orphans, education, workshop, medical relief, maintenance of shrines or the 20 where gross annual income from the waqf property exceeds Rs 5,000/-, which is so in the instant case. 21 Td. section 15 2 22 Id. section 17 CP No.522-L/2013, etc. 11 advancement of any other object of charitable, religious or pious nature or of general public utility are deemed to be charitable purposes under the Ordinance.? Under the Rules 2002, the Chief Administrator Auqaf after taking over and assuming the administration of a waqf property appoints a Manager to administer, control, manage and maintain the waqf property. It is the Manager who prepares a scheme for the administration and development of the waqf property under his charge. The scheme is then submitted to the Chief Administrator Augqaf, who may settle or refuse to settle or return the scheme for reconsideration or may call for the further details or information about the scheme or direct any further examination of the scheme as he may consider . 16. The administration and development of waqf property by the Chief Administrator Augaf under the Ordnance is, therefore, through the mode and mechanism of schemes, with the singular object of advancing and maximizing the wishes of the wakif or the religious, pious and charitable purposes recognized by Islam. A scheme under section 15 of the Ordinance is, therefore, a strategic plan, a road map, a financial feasibility or a business plan for the administration and development of the waqf property, driven and directed by the objectives settled by the wakif or as given under the law. While the word administration in section 15, signifies the overall control, management and maintenance of the waqf properties, the expression development? is of much more 23 Id. Explanation 6 to section 2 e 24The Rules, 2002. Rules 4 and 5 25 The word development has been added in the Ordinance, 1979 and was not there in the corresponding section 11 of West Pakistan Waqf Properties Ordinance, 1961. CP No.522-L/2013, etc. 12 significance and enjoins upon the Chief Administrator Augqaf to expand, evolve and enlarge the scope of charitable work of the waqf with changing times. The scheme to be settled by the Chief Administrator Augqaf must not only carry a plan of action or a programme for the administration of the waqf properties but also the stratagem and vision for its development, evolution and future growth. The Chief Administrator Auqaf must consider, at all time, the best use of the waqf property is to achieve its noble objectives, keeping in view the needs of the time and that of an evolving society. 17. The scheme, like any strategic or development plan has to consider, evaluate and weigh the exiting status of the waqf properties, the revenue generated, the expenditure incurred and most importantly, the central theme of the scheme: the actual advancement of the wishes of the waqif or the promotion of religious, pious and charitable work or work of public utility for the care and welfare of the society. The Chief Administrator Auqaf in settling a scheme must not lose sight of this central objective of the scheme and must always remain cognizant of the historical significance of waqf and how it contributed to the building of Islamic civilization; through which many mosques, schools, and educational centres were built alongwith libraries, scientific research centres and other fields in different walks of life, which gave way to the training of many scientists, researchers, inventors, and intellectuals. The scheme is fundamentally for advancement of such causes and must justify, at all times, that the waqf property is being used to promote and expand the objectives CP No.522-L/2013, etc. 13 mentioned above, improving and growing with time. The settling of scheme, therefore, goes to the root of effective administration and development of waqf property and is the central function of the Chief Administrator Augaf under the Ordinance. To draw up a scheme, therefore, requires the Chief Administrator Auqaf to have sufficient expertise in management, administration, finance, accounts, marketing, planning, development, policy and in running of public charities. He should also be supported by informed and expert recommendations of the qualified managers and administrators appointed under the Ordinance. 18. Maximization of charitable work requires a strong and a growing revenue base, which can be generated through use or letting out of the immovable waqf property or by investments of moneys collected from the waqf property moveable waqf property . Therefore, waqf property can either be put to use to serve a religious, pious or charitable cause directly i.e., by running and managing a shrine or a khanqgah or by establishing a school, college, university, hospital, research and training centres, etc for the general public utility and welfare of the society, either free or at subsidized rates; or indirectly, by leasing it out for purposes closer to the objectives of the waqf. Only as an exception and in the absence of any viable option to lease the property out for purposes closer to the objectives of the waqf, can the waqf property be leased out for commercial purposes. It is underlined that the Scheme must weigh, evaluate and discuss alternatives when leasing out waqf property and preference should always be given to lease out waqf property for purposes that are more akin or close to the CP No.522-L/2013, etc. 14 wishes of the wakif or the objectives given under the law, including charitable purposes. Both the direct or indirect use of waqf property must be justified, in the manner discussed above, with reasons, to be laid out in the scheme that is to be settled and sanctioned by the Chief Administrator Auqaf.? A deliberative and a well-reasoned scheme shows structured exercise of discretion by the Chief Administrator Auqaf, who is burdened with the sole authority under the law, to settle the scheme for the administration and development of the waqf property. 19. In the present case, the proposal for grant of lease of 4 kanals of waqf property for setting up of a petrol pump does not form part of a scheme as discussed above. In fact no scheme has been submitted with the Court. A summary put up for the lease of wagf property as in the present case to set-up a petrol pump in isolation of the other factors and considerations, without an overall plan or a road map, as discussed above, does not constitute a scheme, envisaged under the Ordinance. Questions like: why is the waqf property required to be put on lease? why for a petrol pump and not for any other purpose more akin to the objectives of the waqf? why for a meagre rental of Rs 4,000/- per month? and why for a period of 30 years? why allegedly in a playground abutting a school? And whether other alternatives were discussed and weighed by the Chief Administrator Auqaf? is the waqf in a deficit or loss ? How is the rental money to be utilized for the advancement of the objectives of the waqf ? These questions and points need to be explained and answered in the scheme, which, in 26 The Rules, 2002. Rule 7 CP No.522-L/2013, etc. 15 fact, showcases the lawful exercise of discretion by the Chief Administrator Auqaf under the Ordinance. According to the information supplied to this Court, total revenue earned by the wagqf property is Rs 3,958,934/- R from lease of agricultural land, rent of shops, income from cash boxes, rent of colleges and contract of mela ground; while the expenditure of the waqf is Rs 1,671,792/- E . Thus, revenue exceeds the expenditure by Rs 2,287,142/- R-E . Therefore, the leasing out of a portion of wagf property for the establishment of petrol pump commercial purpose needs justification and requires explanation. We hold that in the absence of a well thought out scheme, sanction for lease of any waqf property cannot be permitted. 20. Sections 9 and 19 of the Ordinance read with Rule 7 of the Rules, 2002 recognize that the waqf property can be put out on lease to generate income for the waqf. Under Rule 7 of the Rules 2002, lease is granted for a year and shall not exceed three years. However, it is extendable for another two years subject to the approval of the Chief Administrator Augqaf. Finally the lease can be extended even for a longer period if the Chief Administrator Auqaf is of the opinion that it is in the best interest of the waqf property. Any departure for the statutory period of lease provided in Rule 7 must be explained and recorded in the scheme with reasons and must show, how the extension in time, best serves the interest of the waqf property. 21. The scheme settled for the administration and development of waqf properties is a manifestation of the discretion exercised by the Chief Administrator Auqaf, in the best interest of the waqf CP No.522-L/2013, etc. 16 under the law and is, therefore, always open to judicial review by the courts. 22. For the above reasons, the grant of lease of waqf property for the setting up of a petrol pump to the petitioner without there being settlement of a proper scheme, as discussed above, and in the absence of any plausible reasons for extending the lease beyond the statutory period given under Rule 7 of Rules 2002, is offensive to the provisions of the Ordinance and Rules 2002, and hence illegal. We uphold the decision of the High Court, but for reasons of our own, discussed above. Leave is, therefore, declined and these petitions are dismissed. Chief Administrator Augaf, may lease out waqf property, in future, but after settlement and sanction of the scheme, in the manner provided under the Ordinance and Rules 2002, as explained in this judgment. 23. The Deputy Registrar of the Lahore Branch Registry of this Court shall ensure that a copy of this judgment is dispatched to all the Chief Administrators Augaf, in the country, for their information and compliance.

agricultural land, rent of shops, income from cash boxes, rent of colleges and contract of mela ground; while the expenditure of the waqf is Rs 1,671,792/- E .", "Thus, revenue exceeds the expenditure by Rs 2,287,142/- R-E .", "Therefore, the leasing out of a portion of wagf property for the establishment of petrol pump commercial purpose needs justification and requires explanation.", "We hold that in the absence of a well thought out scheme, sanction for lease of any waqf property cannot be permitted.", "Sections 9 and 19 of the Ordinance read with Rule 7 of the Rules, 2002 recognize that the waqf property can be put out on lease to generate income for the waqf.", "Under Rule 7 of the Rules 2002, lease is granted for a year and shall not exceed three years.", "However, it is extendable

Chief Administrator Auqaf, in the best interest of the waqf CP No.522-L/2013, etc.", "16 under the law and is, therefore, always open to judicial review by the courts.", "For the above reasons, the grant of lease of waqf property for the setting up of a petrol pump to the petitioner without there being settlement of a proper scheme, as discussed above, and in the absence of any plausible reasons for extending the lease beyond the statutory period given under Rule 7 of Rules 2002, is offensive to the provisions of the Ordinance and Rules 2002, and hence illegal.", "We uphold the decision of the High Court, but for reasons of our own, discussed above.", "Leave is, therefore, declined and these petitions are dismissed.", "Chief Administrator Augaf, may lease out waqf property, in future,

Consequently, no amount of tax was liable to be\ndeposited along with the tax return for both the tax years. In these\ncircumstances, the learned High Court has held that the minimum\npenalty of Rs.5000/- provided in Table 1 can be lawfully collected\nfrom the respondent. It has supported its view by reference to an\nExplanation that was inserted in Column 3 of the Table by the\n\nFinance Act, 2011 to the following effect:\n\n“Explanation. For the purposes of this entry, it is\ndeclared that the expression “tax payable” means\ntax chargeable on the taxable income on the basis of\nassessment made or treated to have been made\n\n\nwe\n\nCivil Appeal No. 1269 of 2013 etc.\n\nunder sections 120, 121, 122 or 122C. (emphasis\nsupplied).”\n\n3. The learned High Court has held that the Explanation\nexpends the meaning of the expression “tax payable” showing that\npreviously that expression meant the amount of tax to be paid. In\nthe present case involving nil outstanding liability to pay tax, the\nquestion is whether the Explanation retrospectively imposes for the\npast period of default an increased penal liability being a\nproportion of the total “tax chargeable’ on the respondent\nassessee, An explanation in a statute ordinarily operates to clarify\nthe law prospectively. However, retrospective liability is imposed\nwhen an explanation attributes a meaning to a substantive\nprovision or expression whereby the burden, obligation or liability\nof a person is increased for a past period. Such retrospective\nimpact is to be avoided’ unless the express language of the\nexplanation warrants such an interpretation.\n\n4. The expression “tax payable” originally used in\nColumn 3 of the Table quantified the amount of penalty payable by\nan assessee in the event of the specified default by him. Being\npenal in nature, that expression was subject to a narrow\ninterpretation. However, in the year 2011 the said expression ibid\nwas Clarified to have a wider meaning which increased the leviable\namount of penalty. At the relevant time in this case, namely, tax\nyear 2008 and tax year 2009, a plain interpretation of the\nexpression meant that the amount of tax payable with the return\nformed the base figure for calculating the penalty amount. Prior to\n\nthe Explanation, the expression “tax payable” could not be read to\n\nimpose a larger penalty based on the amount of tax that was\n\n\n=~\n\nee\n\nCivil Appeal No. 1269 of 2013 etc. 4\n\nchargeable on the taxable income of the assessee for that\nassessment year. In the present case, due to deductions of\nwithholding tax at Source no amount of tax was Payable with the\nreturn by the respondent-assessee. The enhanced liability sought\nto be enforced by the appellants under the expanded meaning\ngiven by the Explanation in the year 2011 becomes effective from\nthe time of its promulgation and not prior thereto.

These appeals involve a common question of law, namely, whether the default by an assessee to file his income tax return within the prescribed time attracts the penalty imposed under the Table appended to Section 182 1 of the Income Tax Ordinance 2001, Sr. No.1 whereof provides as follows: Vid ee ! i Civil Appeal No. 1269 of 2013 etc. Where any person fails to furnish a return of income or a statement as required under section 115 or wealth statement, wealth reconciliation statement or statement under section 165 within the Penalties Such person shali pay a penalty equal to 0.1 of the tax payable for each day of default subject to a minimum penalty of five thousand rupees Section of the Ordinance to which, offence has reference 114,115,116 and 165 maximum penalty of 25 of the tax payable in respect of that tax emphasis ed due date. and 2 The difference of opinion between the parties is whether the expression tax payable pertains to the amount of tax that remains to be deposited with the return or the expression refers the total tax liability of the assessee for the income year in question, In Civil Appeal No.1269 of 2013 as well as the other connected appeals the respondent assessee claims that the entire amount of tax chargeable upon him for the tax years 2008 and 2009 in case of C.A. 1269 of 2013 was deducted at source as withholding tax. Consequently, no amount of tax was liable to be deposited along with the tax return for both the tax years. In these circumstances, the learned High Court has held that the minimum penalty of Rs.5000/- provided in Table 1 can be lawfully collected from the respondent. It has supported its view by reference to an Explanation that was inserted in Column 3 of the Table by the Finance Act, 2011 to the following effect: Explanation. For the purposes of this entry, it is declared that the expression tax payable means tax chargeable on the taxable income on the basis of assessment made or treated to have been made we Civil Appeal No. 1269 of 2013 etc. under sections 120, 121, 122 or 122C. emphasis supplied . 3. The learned High Court has held that the Explanation expends the meaning of the expression tax payable showing that previously that expression meant the amount of tax to be paid. In the present case involving nil outstanding liability to pay tax, the question is whether the Explanation retrospectively imposes for the past period of default an increased penal liability being a proportion of the total tax chargeable on the respondent assessee, An explanation in a statute ordinarily operates to clarify the law prospectively. However, retrospective liability is imposed when an explanation attributes a meaning to a substantive provision or expression whereby the burden, obligation or liability of a person is increased for a past period. Such retrospective impact is to be avoided unless the express language of the explanation warrants such an interpretation. 4. The expression tax payable originally used in Column 3 of the Table quantified the amount of penalty payable by an assessee in the event of the specified default by him. Being penal in nature, that expression was subject to a narrow interpretation. However, in the year 2011 the said expression ibid was Clarified to have a wider meaning which increased the leviable amount of penalty. At the relevant time in this case, namely, tax year 2008 and tax year 2009, a plain interpretation of the expression meant that the amount of tax payable with the return formed the base figure for calculating the penalty amount. Prior to the Explanation, the expression tax payable could not be read to impose a larger penalty based on the amount of tax that was ee Civil Appeal No. 1269 of 2013 etc. 4 chargeable on the taxable income of the assessee for that assessment year. In the present case, due to deductions of withholding tax at Source no amount of tax was Payable with the return by the respondent-assessee. The enhanced liability sought to be enforced by the appellants under the expanded meaning given by the Explanation in the year 2011 becomes effective from the time of its promulgation and not prior thereto. In the circumstances therefore, we agree with the findings of the learned High Court. 5: For the foregoing reasons, these appeals are dismissed. No order as to costs.

The petitioner was appointed as\n\nMali (gardener) in BPS-o1 vide office order dated 30.04.2009 in the\nCantonment Board, Peshawar. Thereafter, he was absorbed against the\npermanent post of Telephone Operator in BPS-02 vide office order dated\n23.08.2010. During his service as a Telephone Operator, the petitioner\nabsented himself from duty on 07.02.2011. The department initiated\ndisciplinary proceedings against the petitioner and appointed an inquiry\nofficer, who recommended in his report dated 10.05.2011 that 1/4\" amount\nfrom the monthly salary of the petitioner be deducted as fine and he be also\ngiven last/final chance and in case he does not improve his behavior in future\nhe be punished strictly. However, the authorized officer removed the petitioner\n\nfrom service vide office order dated 21.05.2011. Thereafter, the petitioner\n\nCP No.330-P/201 2\n\npreferred departmental appeal before the Director, Military Lands and\nCantonment, Peshawar which was dismissed vide order dated 24.05.2012, as\nbeing barred by time. The petitioner challenged the same through writ petition\nbefore the Peshawar High Court which was dismissed vide impugned order\ndated 15.05.2013.\n\n2. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that petitioner was\nremoved from service just because he absented himself from service for one\nday i.e., on 07.02.2011. He further submits that if the authorized officer was to\ndisagree with the findings of the inquiry officer, he should have given reasons\nand granted fresh opportunity of hearing to the petitioner. In this regard he\nreferred to Rule 7(a) of the Government Servants (Efficiency and Discipline)\nRules, 1973 and placed reliance on the case of Habibullah Bhutto v. Collector\n\nof Customs (2011 SCMR 1504).\n\n3. Learned counsel representing the respondents submitted that the\npetitioner had been absenting himself in the past and considering his record\nthe penalty of removal is commensurate. He further submitted that petitioner\n\nhas been removed from service in terms of the Pakistan Cantonment Servants\n\nRules, 1954 (“Cantonment Rules”)\n\n4. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have\nexamined the record. The petitioner, during his service as Telephone Operator,\nearlier absented himself from duty on 21.11.2010. As a result he was fined a\nsum of Rs.2000/-. He then absented himself on 07.02.2011, which resulted in\nhis removal from service, which is the subject matter of this petition. Under\nRule 50 of the Cantonment Rules, the Authority of the petitioner is the\n\nPresident, Cantonment Board and the Authorized Officer is the Cantonment\n\nExecutive Officer!. The procedure of inquiry under the said Rule is that if a\nmajor penalty is to be imposed the Authorized Officer is required to forward\n\nthe case to the Authority alongwith charge and statement of allegations. In the\n\n* The legal position as it stood prior to the amendments made in Rule 50 through SRO 205(I)/2012\ndated 20\" February, 2012.\n\nCP No.330-P/201 3\n\ninstant case, the impugned order has been passed by the authorized officer and\nhas not been forwarded to the Authority. Additionally, the inquiry officer had\nrecommended deduction of salary (1/4 amount from his monthly salary) as a\nfine for absence from duty on 07.02.2011 and giving him last chance to\nimprove himself. The Authorized Officer, if disagreeing with the inquiry officer,\nshould have issued fresh notice to the petitioner and given reasons for his\ndisagreement and justification for visiting the petitioner with a graver penalty.\n\nReliance is placed on Habibullah Bhutto v. Collector of Customs (2011 SCMR\n\n1504). Learned counsel appearing for the respondent Cantonment Board\ncandidly conceded to both these omissions. With these legal infirmities in the\ndisciplinary proceedings, the order of removal of the petitioner was totally\nwithout jurisdiction, therefore, the question of the departmental appeal being\nbarred by time pales into insignificance. It is also noticed that earlier absence\nof the petitioner from duty, while working as a Mali, weighed with the High\nCourt in upholding his removal order. The petitioner had absented himself\nfrom work on 25.01.2010, 08.05.2010 and 10.05.2010. According to the record,\nthe petitioner has already been penalized for absenting himself on the said\ndates and more importantly inspite of this background, he on the basis of his\n“satisfactory performance,” was absorbed against a permanent higher post i-e.,\n\nTelephone Operator in BPS-02, on 23.08.2010.\n\n5. There is yet another dimension of the case. The court can\nexamine and judicially review the executive discretion exercised by the\nauthorized officer on the ground of proportionality. Alongside reasonableness,\nproportionality is now a central standard directing the action of the executive\nbranch. The point of departure is that a disproportionate act that infringes\nupon a human right is an illegal act. The court, which guards the legality of the\nacts of the executive branch, performs judicial review over these acts and\nexamines whether they fulfill the tests of proportionality. Proportionality is a\nstandard that examines the relationship between the objective the executive\n\nbranch wishes to achieve, which has the potential of infringing upon a human\n\nCP No.330-P/201 4\n\nright, and the means it has chosen in order to achieve that infringing objective.\nThe fiduciary duty, from which the administrative duty of fairness and\nadministrative reasonableness are derived, demands administrative\nproportionality as well.2 “The courts will quash exercises of discretionary\npowers in which there is not a reasonable relationship between the objective\nwhich is sought to be achieved and the means used to that end, or where\npunishments imposed by administrative bodies or inferior courts are wholly\nout of proportion to the relevant misconduct?. An administrative measure\nmust not be more drastic than necessary or to sum up in a phrase - not taking a\nsledgehammer to crack a nut4. According to De Smith’s Judicial Review5, the\nstandards of proportionality and unreasonableness are _ inextricably\nintertwined. Unreasonableness contains two elements of proportionality when\nit requires the weight of relevant considerations to be fairly balanced and when\nit forbids unduly oppressive decisions. Under the first element, proportionality\nis a test requiring the decision- maker to maintain a fair balance. Under this\ncategory the courts evaluate whether manifestly disproportionate weight has\nbeen attached to one or other considerations relevant to the decision. The\nsecond element is that the courts consider whether there has been a\ndisproportionate interference with the claimants rights or interests. A more\nsophisticated version of proportionality provides for a structured test. Here the\ncourts ask first whether the measure, which is being challenged, is suitable to\nattaining the identified ends (the test of suitability). Suitability here includes\nthe notion of “rational connection” between the means and ends. The next step\nasks whether the measure is necessary and whether a less restrictive or\nonerous method could have been adopted (the test of necessity - requiring\n\nminimum impairment of the rights or interest in question).\n\n?

Applying the test of proportionality to the executive discretion\nexercised in the instant case, the order of the authorized officer, other than the\nlegal infirmities discussed above, fails to maintain fair balance by removing a\nperson from service because he absented himself from duty for a day. The\nexecutive discretion also fails the structured test of proportionality including\nthe test of suitability and test of necessity requiring minimum impairment of\n\nthe right of the petitioner.\n\n7. For the above reasons, this petition is converted into an appeal\nand allowed. The order of removal of the petitioner from service and the\nimpugned order passed by the High Court, upholding the removal of the\npetitioner from service is set aside and the petitioner reinstated into service\nwithout back benefits, as the petitioner has categorically stated in court that he\n\ndoes not wish to seek back benefits.\n\n8.

Learned Assistant Advocate General, Punjab,\nappearing on behalf of the appellants argued that admittedly the\nrespondents were appointed for one year term on ad-hoc basis and\nupon completion of their term in the year 1997 their services stood\nautomatically terminated. He submitted that after keeping quiet for\n14 years, the respondents filed writ petitions in the year 2011,\nseeking reinstatement back in service purely on the basis of\ndecisions rendered in some other cases by this Court in the year\n2010 whereby work-charge employees were reinstated in service.\nHe contended that the respondents cannot take benefit of a\ndecision delivered in the case of some other persons and that too\nwhen the case of such other persons was on totally different\n\nfooting.\n\n6. Learned counsel for the respondents on the other\n\nhand argued that respondents’ services were terminated through\n\nan omnibus order whereby several other employees were also ©\n\nterminated and once any of such persons, whose services were °\n\nterminated through an omnibus order, is reinstated in service then\n\nthe same benefit is to be extended to all other affected employees\n\nil\n\n\nCIVIL APPEAL NOs. 110-L & 111-L OF 2013 4\n\nin view of the judgment of this Court in the case of Hameed Akhtar\nNiazi_ Vs. Secretary Establishment Division, Government of\nPakistan (1996 SCMR 1185). He next contended that against the\njudgments delivered in writ petitions, intra court appeals were not\nmaintainable, therefore, the appellants ought to have challenged\nthe judgments passed by the learned Single Judge in writ petitions\nbefore this Court and having not done so the same have attained\n\nfinality and are to be given effect to.\n\nFs We have noted that the ‘intra-court appeals were\ndismissed on the point of jurisdiction and not on merits, We may\npoint out that the benefit in Hameed Akhtar Niazi’s case was based —\non altogether different reasoning. ‘The ratio in Hameed Akhtar\nNiazi’s case was that where a Tribunal or Court decides a point of\nlaw relating to terms and conditions of service of civil servants\nwhich governs not only those who litigated but also those who have\nnot resorted to any legal proceedings, then irrespective of this they\ntoo become entitled to the same benefit. Hameed Akhtar Niazi’s\ncase therefore extends benefit to civil servants who were not party\nto the litigation and the entitlement of benefit granted to the\nlitigating civil servants is so common that it is also extendable to\nthose who have not litigated, therefore, they too can legitimately\nclaim the same irrespective of the fact that they were not party to\nthe litigation. In this case the situation is different. Here the\nrespondents are seeking appointment which plea is decided on -\ncase to case basis. In our view even where an omnibus order is\n\npassed and a party to a case accepts a decision passed against it,\n\n\n~\n\nCIVIL APPEAL NOs. 110-L & 111-L OF 2013 5\n\nthen it cannot subsequently take advantage of the fact that such\n\ndecision upon challenge by some other party before higher forum\n\nstand reversed and the same relief be granted to him also. This bar\nis based on the principle of constructive res judicata and has been\nadequately discussed and applied by a larger bench of this Court\nin the case of Pir Bakhsh Vs. Chairman Allotment Committee (PLD\n1987 Supreme Court 145). In this case also an omnibus order was\nsubject matter of the dispute. In second last paragraph at page\n163 of this judgment it was held as follows:-\n\neagscuaseamasuekewenceieeetes In a controversy raising a dispute inter\nparties, the thing adjudged is conclusive as between the\nparties both on questions of fact and law, but as to what the\nCourt decides generally ts the ratio decidendi or rule of law for\nwhich it is the authority. It is this ratio decidendi which is\napplicable to subsequent cases presenting the same problem\nbetween third parties not involved in the original case nor will\neither of the original parties be bound in at subsequent\ndispute with a third party. It will be misnomer to say that this\nrule of law acts in rem, that is, as' against the whole world as\nconceptually the applicability of the rule of law is either\nfounded on the doctrine of precedent as under the English law\nor rule of stare decisis, and none of the doctrines in its\napplication is inflexible for what has been recalled elsewhere\nin the judgment. Therefore, the judgment cannot act in rem as\nsought to be argued,\n\n8. In Pir Bakhsh’s case, while discussing estoppel by\n\njudgment or res judicata a passage from the book “Treatise on the\nConstitutional Limitation” authored: by Cooley was also quoted, At\npage 167 of the said judgment, it was held as follows:-\n\n\"And as to the first, we understand the rule to be, that a\n\ndecision once made in a case, by the highest Court\nempowered to pass upon it, is conclusive upon the parties to\n\nthe controversy and their privies, who are not allowed’\n\nafterwards to revive it in a new proceeding for the purpose of\nraising the same or any other questions, The matter in\ncontroversy has become res judicata, a thing definitely settled\nby judicial decision; and the judgment of the Court imports\n\nwe verity. Whatever the question involved, whether the —\n\n— at # CIVIL APPEAL NOs. 110-L & 111-L OF 2013 6\n\ninterpretation of a private contract, the legality of an\nindividual act, or the validity of a legislative enactment, the |\nrule of finality is the same, the controversy has been\n\nadjudged, and once finally passed upon is never to be\nrenewed.\" fi\n\nAnd further:\n\n\"The rule of conclusiveness to this extent is one of the most is\n\n€ inflexible principles of the law ; in so much that even if it were i if\nsubsequently held by the Courts that the decision in the it\nparticular case was erroneous, such holding would not\nauthorize the reopening of the, old controversy in order that \\\nthe final conclusion might be applied thereto. s\n\nSection 11 of the Civil Procedure Code incorporates this principle,\n\nIn Tarini Charan v. Kedar Nuth (A I R 1928 Cal. 777), the bar |\nof res judicata is stated in these terms\n\n\"lt matters nothing whether the error, if any, was an error on a\npoint of fact or on a point of law\"......\n\n\"Courts of law are in no way authorized to alter the rights of\nparties. They profess, at all events, to ascertain the law, and |\n. if the binding, character of a decision upon a concrete question\nas to the terms of a particular holding is to fluctuate with\nevery alteration in their current of authority, the Courts will\nbecome an instrument for the unsettlement of rights rather\nthan for the ascertainment thereof. The principle relied upon is\nabhorrent to section 11, Civil Penal Code and to the general\nintention of the doctrine of res judicata. If authority be wanted\nfor its rejection a very plain authority can be found in the case\nof Gowri Koer v. Audh Kaur (1884 10 Cal. 1087)\".....\n\n\"The question whether decision is correct or erroneous has no\nbearing upon the question whether it operates or does not\noperate asres judicata. The doctrine is that in certain\ncircumstances the Court shall not try a suit or issue but shall\n: deal with the matter on the footing that it is a matter no longer\n\nG open to contest by reason of a previous decision. In these\ncircumstances it must necessarily be wrong for a Court to try\nthe suit or issue, come to its own conclusion thereon, consider '\nwhether the previous decision is right and give effect to it or\nnot according as it conceives the previous decision to be right if\nor wrong. To say, as a result of such disorderly procedure,\nthat the previous decision was wrong and that it was wrong\non a point of law, or on a pure point of law, and that therefore, be\nit may be disregarded, is an indefensible form of reasoning. }\nFor this purpose, it is' not true that a point of law is always it\nopen to a party.\"\n\n\nCIVIL APPEAL NOs. 110-L & 111-L OF 2013 7\n\n\"On the other hand it is plain from the terms of section 11 of\n\nthe Code that what is made conclusive between the parties is”\n\nthe decision of the Court and that the reasoning of the Court is\nnot necessarily the same thing as its decision. The object of\nthe doctrine ofres judicata isnot to fasten upon parties\nspecial principles of law as applicable to them inter se, but to\nascertain their rights and the facts upon which these rights\ndirectly and substantially depend, and to prevent this\nascertainment from becoming nugatory by precluding the\nparties from reopening or recontesting that which has been\nfinally decided.\"\n\n9. In the present proceedings the intra-court appeals filed\nby the appellant were dismissed on the ground that as the\n\nrespondents were ad-hoc employees therefore they are to be\n\ntreated as civil servants and being civil servants the jurisdiction\n\nlies with the Service Tribunal. It is an admitted position that\nrespondents were employed on ad-hoc basis for a fixed tenure\nwhich period expired in the year 1997. Upon completion of their\nterm of service, they did not pursue their legal remedy. If we were\nto still treat the respondents as civil servants, as held in the\nimpugned judgments then we are afraid we would be compelled to\nhold that the writ petitions filed by the respondents were not\nmaintainable. In that eventuality we would be relegating the\nrespondents to seek remedy from the Service Tribunal. However\nthis is not the legal position in the present case. In our view the\nservice of an ad-hoc employee are liable to termination either upon\nthirty days’ notice or one month’s pay in lieu thereof, as mandated\nby Section 10 (3) of the Punjab Civil Servants Act or upon expiry of\nthe period for which a person was appointed on ad-hoc basis as\n\nheld in the case of Dr. Naveeda Tufail Vs. Government of Punjab\n\n(2003 SCMR 291). The fact that respondents automatically ceased\n\n\nCIVIL APPEAL NOs, 110-L & 111-L OF 2013\n\nto be in the employment of the appellants upon expiry of one year\n\nPomme\ncca\n\nperiod in 1997, which fact is acknowledged by one of the\nrespondents himself in Paragraph No.1 of his writ petition and |\nthen did not seek any remedy under the service laws, their\ntermination as ad-hoc employees attained finality and they cannot i\nbe regarded as civil servants. Hence the finding that respondents |\nare still civil servants is not sustainable in law. However, as the | |\nintra-court appeals were not decided on merits of their claim that\nthey be re-employed on regular basis, we refrain ourselves from |\ndeciding the question whether the respondents who once were ad-\nhoc employees are still entitled to be appointed on regular basis, In\nthe circumstances, it would be in the interest of justice that the\n\nmatter be remanded back to the learned division Bench of the High\n\nCourt to decide both the appeals in accordance with law.\n\n10.

This bar is based on the principle of constructive res judicata and has been adequately discussed and applied by a larger bench of this Court in the case of Pir Bakhsh Vs.

Brief facts of the case emerging out of the record would\nreveal that after the demise of propositus of the parties Haji Gul Hassan\nSheikh, his son Haji Sultan Mehmood, Respondent No.1, herein, was\nsuccessful in getting a succession certificate dated 13.11.2006 in his name\nby claiming himself to be the sole legal heir of the deceased propositus.\nAfter culmination of the proceedings in his favour, he alongwith his son\nHassan Mehmood as guarantor also submitted an undertaking in the Court\nfor submission of details of accounts and also held themselves jointly and\nindividually liable/ responsible to satisfy the claim of any other legal heir\nof the deceased if any, in case someone comes forward. On getting\nknowledge of the said fraudulent act of Respondent No. 1, present\nAppellants moved an application under Section 383 of the Succession Act,\n1925 for revocation of said succession certificate bearing No. 35/2006\ndated 13.11.2006, the same was ultimately allowed by the trial Court vide\nits judgment/ order dated 28.02.2011. The Respondent No. 1 herein,\nfeeling himself aggrieved of the order of revocation, questioned the same\nby way of an appeal before the High Court which was accepted and order\nof revocation of succession certificate dated 28.02.2011 of the trial Court\nwas set aside, hence, the present appeal.\n\n3. Learned counsels for the parties were heard and the record of\nthe case was perused.\n\n4. Perusal of the record would reveal that the fact that the\ndeceased propositus of the parties had two wives, has never been disputed\nby any one. Present Appellants, the two daughters were from Mst. Noor\n\nBibi and Respondents No. | to 4 herein, were from his other wife namely\n\nC.A.No.288/13 3\n\nMst. Hussain Bibi (both the widows died during the pendency of\n\napplication for revocation of succession certificate).\n\nStatus and relationship of the parties intrse before the Court\nwas never disputed even by the Respondent No. | rather he alleged in his\nreply that according to a family settlement, all the legal heirs had received\ntheir share of inheritance and for that reason they were deliberately not\njoined as party in the application for grant of succession certificate. When\nstatus and relationship of the parties with the predecessors in interest is not\ndenied then every legal heir is entitled to get/ receive his/ her Shari share\nto the extent of his/ her entitlement in the property moveable/ immovable\nleft by the predecessor. So, all the legal heirs of deceased Haji Gul Hassan\nhave the right to get to the extent of their respective shares. Before\nproceeding further we may observe that Respondent No.1 in his reply\nalleged that every legal heir was paid his/her due share. So it was for the\nRespondent No.1 to have proved his stance of payment of respective\nshares to all the legal heirs but he has miserably failed to do so. Mere\nallegations in the pleadings would never be sufficient to establish the fact\nalleged in the pleadings. So, we without any hesitation observe that all the\nlegal heirs are entitled to get the respective share in the legacy of\npropositus.\n\nWe at present are only concerned with the amounts shown in\nthe application for succession certificate (original and amended). Under the\nlaw, the Appellants herein are entitled to get their Shari shares as per their\nentitlement and the trial Court while revoking the original certificate of\n\nsuccession has very rightly held as under:\n\nC.A.No.288/13\n\n“ T heard arguments advanced by the parties in support and\nagainst the application and I also went through the record of\nsuccession certificate No. 35/2006 alongwith present\napplication. The objection raised by the contesting\nrespondents were just about time limitation of filing of this\napplication. Other objections were about affidavit of\napplicant that same are not genuine and further allegation\nraised that the applicants both female having no knowledge\nand this application has been filed in connivance of husband\nof one of the applicants. It is alleged that name of deceased\nhas not been mentioned correctly. The whole objections\nraised having no weight to discard the legal entitlement of\nthe applicants as legal heirs or protect the wrongful act of\nrespondent No. 1. The respondent badly failed to show that\non what account he obtained cash amount of deceased\nwithout giving the share of other legal heirs. The question\nrelating whether this application is time barred in this regard\nit is settled principle of law that no time limit will be counted\nif the action found to be result of fraud of misrepresentation\nand in such situation or case it is held by the honorable apex\ncourts that time runs from the date of knowledge. So\nobjection about time limitation is discarded. Previous record\nfully shows that respondent No. 1 Sultan Mehmood\ncommitted fraud by concealment of fact not mentioned in his\napplication and in ex-parte evidence that the deceased has\nalso other legal heirs. As sufficient evidence available on\nrecord that all legal heirs of deceased Haji Gul Hassan\nSheikh are entitled for their shares according to\nMuhammadan law and Islamic Sharia so I have no hesitation\nto accept this application for revocation of succession\ncertificate. From the record it is also revealed that surety\nnamely Hassan Mahmood s/o Sultan Mahmood and\nMuhammad Ismail s/o Ghulam Dastagir have also taken\nback (release) their surety after completion of three years\nstill according to their affidavit filed at the time of filing\nsurety they have taken fully responsibility that in case of\nfraud and misrepresentation they are liable to pay the amount\nfor which they stood surety and on the basis of same\nundertaking that are under obligation to pay the amount in\ncase the respondent No. 1 failed to pay the amount to the all\nlegal heirs surviving according to Sharia Fithwa. Murasallah\nbe sent to revenue authority/ Tehsildar Quetta for report\nwithin four-days alongwith copy of Fard and affidavit of\nsurety available on the record for attachment of property of\nsureties till recovery of amount or otherwise for recovery of\nprocess of sale of attached property according to law. The\napplicants further directed to file Sharia Fithwa the same\nmust be verified and appear in person while applying for\nsuccession certificate. Application disposed off in this\nmanner”.\n\nC.A.No.288/13 5\n\n5. Perusal of the impugned judgment would reflect that the\nsame instead of dealing with the substantial question of law, is based on\nmere technicalities. The facts which prevailed with the High Court were (i)\nthe affidavits of Respondent No. 1 and his witnesses, (11) no response by\nthe Appellants for more than a period of 3 4 years inspite of publication in\na newspaper of wide circulation (iii) the amount in question was\nwithdrawn by the Respondent No. 1 long before and fourthly the liability\nof the sureties was also discharged after a lapse of three years and for the\nabove reasons asked the Appellants to approach the civil Court for\nredressal of their grievances, if any.\n\nThe cardinal principle of Mohammadan law is that the\ninheritance of a person opens the moment he dies and all the legal heirs\nbecome owners to the extent of their respective shares there and then by\nthe dint of settled law. Sanction of inheritance mutation, issuance of\nsuccession certificate etc. are the procedural matters regulated by the\nprocedural laws just to make the records in order and also for fiscal\npurposes. Similarly law of limitation provides a specific period to avail a\nremedy provided under the law by way of filing suit, preferring appeal and\nmaking any application and if the same is filed/preferred or made beyond\nthe prescribed period of time as provided in the schedule, subject to certain\nprovisions of law, has to be dismissed but said dismissal cannot take away\nthe right of that person as was held by this Court in the case of Pervaiz\nAkhtar_and_ another versus The Additional District Judge, Rawalpindi\nand four others (1990 PSC 1109). It is also settled law of the land that\ntechnicalities should not hamper the administration and dispensation of\n\njustice. Whenever it is possible to grant relief under the law, then\n\nC.A.No.288/13 6\n\ntechnicalities in the way of administration of justice should be avoided to\nthe possible extent by remaining within the domain of law. When we look\ninto the facts and circumstances of the present case before us, it becomes\nclear that no statutory period of limitation is provided for grant of any\nsuccession certificate under Section 372 or its revocation under Section\n383 of the Succession Act, 1925. When no further intricate question of law\nof inheritance was there to be resolved by any competent Court of law,\nproceedings under the Succession Act, 1925 were very much competent\nirrespective of efflux of time.\n\nIt is established on the record that the original certificate was\nobtained by Respondent No. 1 by practicing fraud with the Court and the\nAppellants on 13.11.2006 and the Appellants asked for revocation of said\ncertificate after a period of more than 3 4% years when they got knowledge\nof the same. As discussed above that no statutory time frame has been\nprovided under Limitation Act, 1908 for asking for issuance of or\nrevocation of succession certificate but even then it has to be availed\nwithin a reasonable time. If at all we put any embargo/ clog of limitation\nthen at the most that can be dealt with under Article 181 of Limitation Act,\n1908 which provides a period of three years to ask for any such relief.\nSettled law of the land in such like situations is that the period of limitation\nwould start running from the date of knowledge. While looking in this\nperspective, in absence of any evidence to the contrary, the presumption\nwould be that the Appellants being poor illiterate ladies had no knowledge\nof the original succession certificate and after getting knowledge of the\n\nsame filed application for revocation of succession certificate.\n\nC.A.No.288/13 7\n\n6. The application so filed by the Appellants for revocation of\nthe succession certificate was also held to have been incompetently filed as\nthe application was only signed by the counsel and the counsel was also\nauthorized by Appellant No. 1 i.e. Mst. Zohra Bibi only and Mst. Samina\nBibi had not signed the power of attorney of the counsel. Again this view\nof the High Court is based on hyper technicality especially in the facts and\ncircumstances of the case in hand. The established law is that Advocate/\nPleader can sign the pleadings on behalf of the party and he is normally\nauthorized by the party while signing the power of attorney in this behalf\nand the provisions of Order III of the CPC in this regard are very much\nclear. The record of the proceedings clarifies the fact that the Appellant\nNo. 1 was properly represented as she had signed the power of attorney of\nthe counsel and let’s presume for a while that Respondent No. 2 was not\nproperly represented, whether this alone would disentitle her to get her\nshare in the legacy left by her father. Answer to this question would be a\nsimple “No”. Under the law it is not necessary that each and every legal\nheir should be properly represented and appear before the Court to get a\nsuccession certificate. The Court on receiving such application has to\nissue/ grant succession certificate in favor of all the legal heirs by\nconsidering and determining their respective shares by complying with the\nprocedural requirements of law in this regard. So, the decision of High\nCourt in this regard is sheer violation of the law and cannot be maintained.\n\n7. Yet another aspect of the case, as was held by the High\nCourt, would also require our attention that after the lapse of such a long\ntime the better course for the Appellants was to approach the Civil Court.\n\nYes; this approach of the High Court would have been a valid one if there\n\nC.A.No.288/13 8\n\nhad some dispute regarding status and relationship of the parties inter-se.\nBut in this case, there is no such dispute. There are two distinct groups of\nthe legal heirs of the deceased. Appellants being the legal heirs from one\nwife and the Respondents from the other wife. Their complicity can be\nadjudged from the fact that Respondents No. 2 to 4 the real sisters of\nRespondent No. 1 have joined hands with Respondent No. 1 by alleging to\nhave received their share by supporting the appeal of Respondent No. 1\nbefore the High Court and the two poor ladies from the other wife of\npropositus i.e. the Appellants were left without any relief who also happen\nto be their step sisters. (By keeping in mind the conduct of Respondent No.\n1, we also doubt the satisfaction of claim of Respondent No. 2 to 4). So,\nwe in the peculiar circumstances of the case cannot send the parties\nespecially the two Appellants for yet another round of litigation for a\nmatter which require no further adjudication except the discharge of\nliability by Respondent No. 1 as he alongwith his son had given an\nundertaking to satisfy the claims of any other legal heir, if came forward.\nSo, we endorse the procedure adopted by the trial court for the recovery of\nsaid amount with the direction that the needful be done within a period of\ntwo months positively after the receipt of this judgment and a compliance\nreport be also forwarded to the Additional Registrar (Judicial) of this\nCourt.\n\n8. Since it has been established on the record that Respondent\nNo. 1 had verified a false statement, rather concealed the true facts before\nthe Court regarding actual legal heirs of the deceased propositus and thus\napparently has committed fraud with the Court and the parties so we\n\ncannot shut our eyes to this very fact and we, therefore, direct the trial\n\nC.A.No.288/13 9\n\nCourt to proceed against the Respondent No. 1 under Section 198 PPC as\nrequired by Section 372 (2) of the Succession Act, 1925.\n\n9. In view of the above discussion this appeal is allowed in\nabove terms with costs to be borne by Respondent No. 1 of the entire\n\nlitigation for the reasons mentioned above.\n\nJudge\n\nJudge\nBench-III\nIslamabad\n6% December, 2017\n\nZia* Approved for Reporting.", "CleanedText": "SECTION NOT FOUND: IN THE SUPREME COURT OF PAKISTAN Appellate Jurisdiction PRESENT: Mr. Justice Umar Ata Bandial Mr. Justice Mazhar Alam Khan Miankhel Civil Appeal No. 288 of 2013.

The brief facts necessary for adjudication of\n\nthe lis at hand are that the Appellant and\n\nCA.14-L/2013 2\n\nRespondent No.3 were married but unfortunately,\nthe matrimonial relationship between the parties\ncollapsed, whereafter, Respondent No.3 filed a Suit\nfor Dissolution of Marriage as well as the Suit for\nReturn of Dowry Articles. The former Suit was\ndecreed vide judgment and decree dated 01.02.2008\nand the marriage dissolved. No challenge was thrown\nto it and such decree attained finality.\n\n3. The Suit for Dowry Articles was also\ndecreed by the learned Family Court for an amount\nof Rs.25,000/- vide judgment and decree dated\n29.09.2009. Respondent No.3 filed an appeal before\nthe learned First Appellate Court, which was allowed\nvide judgment and decree dated 27.01.2010 and the\ndecretal amount was enhanced to Rs.4,00,000/-. In\nthe above backdrop, the present Appellant invoked\nthe Constitutional jurisdiction of the learned Lahore\nHigh Court, Lahore by filing Writ Petition No.4144 of\n2010. After hearing the parties, vide impugned Order\ndated 27.03.2012, the Writ Petition filed by the\n\npresent Appellant was partly accepted and the\n\nCA.14-L/2013 3\n\namount in lieu of dowry articles was reduced to\nRs.3,00,000/-.\n\n4. The Appellant invoked the jurisdiction of\nthis Court by filing Civil Petition bearing No.781-L of\n2012, in which Leave to Appeal was granted vide\nOrder dated 01.01.2013. The said Order is\nreproduced herein below for ease of reference:\n\n“States, that the judgment and\ndecree of the Family Court pertaining\nto the return of dowry articles was to\nthe tune of Rs.25,000/- (rupees\ntwenty five thousand), thus as per the\nprovisions of Section 14(2)(b) of the\nWest Pakistan Family Courts Act,\n1964, no appeal was competent\nbefore the learned Additional District\nJudge, therefore, the appellate\njudgment which has been partly\naffirmed by the learned High Court is\nwithout jurisdiction. Besides, the list\nof dowry articles had not been proved\nby the respondent in terms of the law\nand there are many contradictions in\nthose which are apparent on the face\nof the record. Leave is granted to\nconsider the above.”\n\n5. We have heard the learned counsel for the\nparties and examined the available record.\n\n6. The learned Appellate Court, after\nexamining the evidence available on the record,\n\nreturned a finding that Respondent No.3 was entitled\n\nCA.14-L/2013 4\n\nto return of dowry articles and in lieu thereof she\nwas entitled to a sum of Rs.4,00,000/-. The learned\nHigh Court, after examining the evidence, more\nparticularly, the statement of Respondent No.3 as\nPW-1 concurred with the findings of the learned First\nAppellate Court that the said Respondent was\nentitled to the value of the dowry articles but the\nquantum thereof was reduced from Rs.4,00,000/- to\nRs.3,00,000/-. The findings of the learned High\nCourt appeared to be based on a fair and reasonable\nappreciation of the evidence. No misreading or non-\nreading of evidence has been pointed out at the bar.\nThe reasoning does not appear to be perverse. Thus,\nno ground for interference, in this behalf, is made\nout.\n\n7. The only other question, which floated to\nthe surface and was asserted by the learned counsel\nfor the Appellant is that the learned Family Court\nhad granted a decree for a sum of Rs.25,000/- upon\nthe claim of dowry, hence, in view of Section 14(2) of\nthe Family Courts Act, 1964 (Act of 1964), no appeal\n\nwas maintainable against the said judgment and\n\nCA.14-L/2013 5\n\ndecree being less than the amount mentioned in the\naforesaid provisions of law; hence, the judgment and\ndecree of the learned First Appellate Court was\nwholly without jurisdiction. Consequently, the\nimpugned Order of the learned High Court partly\naffirming the same was also liable to be set aside.\nLeave in the instant case has been granted to\nconsider the aforesaid aspect of the matter.\n\n8. The aforesaid contentions of the learned\ncounsel for the Appellant have been controverted by\nthe learned counsel for Respondent No.3. It has been\ncontended that the embargo placed on the right of\nappeal being pressed into service by the learned\ncounsel for the Appellant applies to the husband\nonly and not to a wife, dissatisfied with the quantum\nor denial of relief.\n\n9. It is Section 14 of the Act of 1964, more\nparticularly, sub-section (2) thereof, which is\nrequired to be interpreted in order to adjudicate\nupon the divergent contentions, in this behalf,\ncanvassed by the learned counsel for the parties at\n\nthe bar.\n\nCA.14-L/2013 6\n\n10. Before proceeding further, it may be\nappropriate to contextualize the Family Courts Act,\n1964 in general and Section 14(2), in particular. Out\nof the general canvass of the forum and procedure\nfor adjudication of the claims and disputes, a\njurisdiction has been carved out through the\nenactment of the Family Courts Act, 1964, creating a\nspecial forum i.e. the Family Court for adjudication\nof the family disputes in accordance with the special\nprocedure as set forth in the aforesaid Act of 1964\nand the Rules framed thereunder i.e. The West\nPakistan Family Courts Rules, 1965. The purpose of\nthis exercise is evident from the preamble of the Act\nof 1964 i.e. “expeditious settlement and disposal of\ndisputes relating to marriage and family affairs”. The\nnature of disputes which can be brought before the\nFamily Court for adjudication have been set forth\nand enumerated in Part I of the Schedule referred to\nin Section 5 of the Act of 1964. It is now settled law\nthat a purposive rather than a literal approach to\ninterpretation is to be adopted while interpreting\n\nStatutes. An interpretation which advances the\n\nCA.14-L/2013 7\n\npurpose of the Act is to be preferred rather than an\ninterpretation which defeats its objects. Reference, in\nthis behalf, may be made to the judgments reported\n\nas Federation of Pakistan through Ministry of\n\nFinance and others v. M/s. Noori_ Trading\n\nCorporation (Private) Limited and 14 others (1992\nSCMR 710) and Hudabiya Engineering (Pvt) Limited\n\nv. Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Interior,\n\nGovernment of Pakistan and 6 others (PLD 1998\nLahore 90).\n\n11. The second aspect of the Family Courts Act,\n1964 and the Rules framed thereunder as amended\nfrom time to time would reveal its gender sensitivity.\nA glance at Section 3 of the Act of 1964 reveals that\nwomen Judges are specifically catered for. The\nresidence of the wife can be a determining factor for\nconferring territorial jurisdiction in certain Suits as\nis evident from the provisions of Rule 6 of the West\nPakistan Family Courts Rules, 1965. There can be\nno escape from the fact that the tone and tenor of\nthe Family Courts Act, 1964 and the Rules framed\n\nthereunder are beneficial in nature. It is an equally\n\nCA.14-L/2013 8\n\nsettled law that beneficial provisions in a Statute\nmust be interpreted liberally in a manner so that the\nbenefit conferred is advanced rather than frustrated\nor subverted. Reference, in this behalf, may be made\n\nto the judgments of this Court reported as Lahore\n\nDevelopment Authority through D.G., Lahore and\nanother v. Abdul Shafique and others (PLD 2000 SC\n207) and Pakistan Engineering Co. Limited, Lahore\n\nthrough Managing Director v. Fazal Beg and 2 others\n\n(1992 SCMR 2166).\n\n12. Section 14(2) of the Family Courts Act,\n1964, must necessarily be approached and\ninterpreted in the above backdrop and in accordance\nwith the aforesaid principles i.e. the purposive object\nthereof achieved and being beneficial in nature, the\nbenefits so conferred are actualized.\n\n13. Sub-section (1) of Section 14 of the Act of\n1964, confers a right of appeal. However, by virtue of\nsub-section (2) of Section 14 of the Act of 1964, this\nright of appeal has been curtailed. The obvious\npurpose of curtailing the right of appeal is to avoid\n\nthe benefits of any decree which may have been\n\nCA.14-L/2013 9\n\npassed being tied up in an appeal before a higher\nforum. It has also been noticed that in only three\neventualities that even the right of first appeal has\nbeen curtailed. In all three eventualities, the decree\nwould be for the benefit of the wife for dissolution of\nmarriage under Clause (a), for dower or dowry under\nClause (b) and for maintenance under Clause (c).\nThe last may also be for the benefit of a minor. Thus,\nthe only logical and reasonable interpretation, which\nis in accordance with the purposive of the Act and in\nline with the beneficial nature thereof would be that\na judgment-debtor of a decree envisages in Clauses\n(a), (b) and (c) of sub-section (2) of Section 14 of the\nAct of 1964, would not have a right of appeal so that\nthe disputes mentioned therein are _ resolved\nexpeditiously and the benefits conferred through\nsuch decree reach the decree-holder without being\nfrustrated. However, the said provision cannot be\ninterpreted so as to exclude a right of appeal to a\nwife whose claim of dower or dowry has been\n\npartially or entirely declined. For such an\n\nCA.14-L/2013 10\n\ninterpretation, would defeat the purpose and object\nof the Act of 1964 and frustrate its beneficial nature.\n14. This Court while interpreting Section 14(2)\nof the Act of 1964, in its judgment reported as\n\nTayyaba Yunus v. Muhammad Ehsan and_ others\n\n(2010 SCMR 1403) held that where a Suit for dower\nhas been dismissed, the wife has a right of appeal\nunder Section 14(2) of the above-said Act of 1964.\n\n15. In a case pertaining to dissolution of\nmarriage, this Court in the judgment reported as\n\nAbid Hussain v. Additional District Judge, Alipur,\n\nDistrict Muzaffargarh and another (2006 SCMR 100)\nheld as follows:\n\n“The object behind non-provision of\nappeal in case of dissolution of\nmarriage is to protect women, an\nunder privileged and_ generally\noppressed section of our society from\nprolonged and costly litigation. It\naims to put a clog on the right of\nhusband.”\n\n16. Thus, the only possible purposive beneficial\nand rational interpretation of Section 14(2) of the Act\nof 1964, is that the right of appeal of a husband\n\nagainst whom a decree has been passed is curtailed,\n\nCA.14-L/2013 1\n\nif the amount awarded is less than the amount,\nwhich is mentioned in the said provision. However,\nin no event the right of the wife to file an appeal is\nextinguished if she is dissatisfied with any decree in\na Suit for dower or dowry.\n\n17. The aforesaid view incidentally has also\nbeen consistently enunciated by the learned Lahore\nHigh Court in the judgments reported as Ghulam\nRasool v. Senior Civil Judge and 4 others (PLJ 2008\n\nLahore 531), Saeeda Alia v. Syed Ghulam Mursalin\n\nNaqvi and another (2004 MLD 306) and Mst. Neelam\n\nNosheen and others v. Raja Muhammad Khagaan\n\nand others (2002 MLD 784).\n\n18. In this view of the matter, there is no denial\nof fact that the appeal of Respondent No.3 was\nvalidly filed and the learned First Appellate Court\nwas vested with the jurisdiction to adjudicate\nthereupon and such jurisdiction was not barred\nunder Section 14(2) of the Act of 1964. In view of the\nabove, this Civil Appeal is totally devoid of merit and\n\nis liable to be dismissed.\n\nCA.14-L/2013 12\n\n19. These are the reasons of our short Order of\neven date, which is reproduced herein below:\n\n“For reasons to be recorded later,\nthis appeal is dismissed.”\n\nChief Justice\n\nJudge\n\nIslamabad, the\n17th April, 2018 Judge\n\n‘Approved For Reporting’\nSafdar & Mahtab", "CleanedText": "JUDGMENT SH. AZMAT SAEED, J.- This Civil Appeal by leave of the Court is directed against the Order dated 27.03.2012, whereby a Constitutional Petition i.e. Writ Petition No.4144 of 2010, filed by the present Appellant, was partly accepted. 2. The brief facts necessary for adjudication of the lis at hand are that the Appellant and CA.14-L/2013 2 Respondent No.3 were married but unfortunately, the matrimonial relationship between the parties collapsed, whereafter, Respondent No.3 filed a Suit for Dissolution of Marriage as well as the Suit for Return of Dowry Articles. The former Suit was decreed vide judgment and decree dated 01.02.2008 and the marriage dissolved. No challenge was thrown to it and such decree attained finality. 3. The Suit for Dowry Articles was also decreed by the learned Family Court for an amount of Rs.25,000/- vide judgment and decree dated 29.09.2009. Respondent No.3 filed an appeal before the learned First Appellate Court, which was allowed vide judgment and decree dated 27.01.2010 and the decretal amount was enhanced to Rs.4,00,000/-. In the above backdrop, the present Appellant invoked the Constitutional jurisdiction of the learned Lahore High Court, Lahore by filing Writ Petition No.4144 of 2010. After hearing the parties, vide impugned Order dated 27.03.2012, the Writ Petition filed by the present Appellant was partly accepted and the CA.14-L/2013 3 amount in lieu of dowry articles was reduced to Rs.3,00,000/-. 4. The Appellant invoked the jurisdiction of this Court by filing Civil Petition bearing No.781-L of 2012, in which Leave to Appeal was granted vide Order dated 01.01.2013. The said Order is reproduced herein below for ease of reference: States, that the judgment and decree of the Family Court pertaining to the return of dowry articles was to the tune of Rs.25,000/- rupees twenty five thousand , thus as per the provisions of Section 14 2 b of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964, no appeal was competent before the learned Additional District Judge, therefore, the appellate judgment which has been partly affirmed by the learned High Court is without jurisdiction. Besides, the list of dowry articles had not been proved by the respondent in terms of the law and there are many contradictions in those which are apparent on the face of the record. Leave is granted to consider the above. 5. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and examined the available record. 6. The learned Appellate Court, after examining the evidence available on the record, returned a finding that Respondent No.3 was entitled CA.14-L/2013 4 to return of dowry articles and in lieu thereof she was entitled to a sum of Rs.4,00,000/-. The learned High Court, after examining the evidence, more particularly, the statement of Respondent No.3 as PW-1 concurred with the findings of the learned First Appellate Court that the said Respondent was entitled to the value of the dowry articles but the quantum thereof was reduced from Rs.4,00,000/- to Rs.3,00,000/-. The findings of the learned High Court appeared to be based on a fair and reasonable appreciation of the evidence. No misreading or nonreading of evidence has been pointed out at the bar. The reasoning does not appear to be perverse. Thus, no ground for interference, in this behalf, is made out. 7. The only other question, which floated to the surface and was asserted by the learned counsel for the Appellant is that the learned Family Court had granted a decree for a sum of Rs.25,000/- upon the claim of dowry, hence, in view of Section 14 2 of the Family Courts Act, 1964 Act of 1964 , no appeal was maintainable against the said judgment and CA.14-L/2013 5 decree being less than the amount mentioned in the aforesaid provisions of law; hence, the judgment and decree of the learned First Appellate Court was wholly without jurisdiction. Consequently, the impugned Order of the learned High Court partly affirming the same was also liable to be set aside. Leave in the instant case has been granted to consider the aforesaid aspect of the matter. 8. The aforesaid contentions of the learned counsel for the Appellant have been controverted by the learned counsel for Respondent No.3. It has been contended that the embargo placed on the right of appeal being pressed into service by the learned counsel for the Appellant applies to the husband only and not to a wife, dissatisfied with the quantum or denial of relief. 9. It is Section 14 of the Act of 1964, more particularly, sub-section 2 thereof, which is required to be interpreted in order to adjudicate upon the divergent contentions, in this behalf, canvassed by the learned counsel for the parties at the bar. CA.14-L/2013 6 10. Before proceeding further, it may be appropriate to contextualize the Family Courts Act, 1964 in general and Section 14 2 , in particular. Out of the general canvass of the forum and procedure for adjudication of the claims and disputes, a jurisdiction has been carved out through the enactment of the Family Courts Act, 1964, creating a special forum i.e. the Family Court for adjudication of the family disputes in accordance with the special procedure as set forth in the aforesaid Act of 1964 and the Rules framed thereunder i.e. The West Pakistan Family Courts Rules, 1965. The purpose of this exercise is evident from the preamble of the Act of 1964 i.e. expeditious settlement and disposal of disputes relating to marriage and family affairs . The nature of disputes which can be brought before the Family Court for adjudication have been set forth and enumerated in Part I of the Schedule referred to in Section 5 of the Act of 1964. It is now settled law that a purposive rather than a literal approach to interpretation is to be adopted while interpreting Statutes. An interpretation which advances the CA.14-L/2013 7 purpose of the Act is to be preferred rather than an interpretation which defeats its objects. Reference, in this behalf, may be made to the judgments reported as Federation of Pakistan through Ministry of Finance and others v. M/s. Noori Trading Corporation Private Limited and 14 others 1992 SCMR 710 and Hudabiya Engineering Pvt Limited v. Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Interior, Government of Pakistan and 6 others PLD 1998 Lahore 90 . 11. The second aspect of the Family Courts Act, 1964 and the Rules framed thereunder as amended from time to time would reveal its gender sensitivity. A glance at Section 3 of the Act of 1964 reveals that women Judges are specifically catered for. The residence of the wife can be a determining factor for conferring territorial jurisdiction in certain Suits as is evident from the provisions of Rule 6 of the West Pakistan Family Courts Rules, 1965. There can be no escape from the fact that the tone and tenor of the Family Courts Act, 1964 and the Rules framed thereunder are beneficial in nature. It is an equally CA.14-L/2013 8 settled law that beneficial provisions in a Statute must be interpreted liberally in a manner so that the benefit conferred is advanced rather than frustrated or subverted. Reference, in this behalf, may be made to the judgments of this Court reported as Lahore Development Authority through D.G., Lahore and another v. Abdul Shafique and others PLD 2000 SC 207 and Pakistan Engineering Co. Limited, Lahore through Managing Director v. Fazal Beg and 2 others 1992 SCMR 2166 . 12. Section 14 2 of the Family Courts Act, 1964, must necessarily be approached and interpreted in the above backdrop and in accordance with the aforesaid principles i.e. the purposive object thereof achieved and being beneficial in nature, the benefits so conferred are actualized. 13. Sub-section 1 of Section 14 of the Act of 1964, confers a right of appeal. However, by virtue of sub-section 2 of Section 14 of the Act of 1964, this right of appeal has been curtailed. The obvious purpose of curtailing the right of appeal is to avoid the benefits of any decree which may have been CA.14-L/2013 9 passed being tied up in an appeal before a higher forum. It has also been noticed that in only three eventualities that even the right of first appeal has been curtailed. In all three eventualities, the decree would be for the benefit of the wife for dissolution of marriage under Clause a , for dower or dowry under Clause b and for maintenance under Clause c . The last may also be for the benefit of a minor. Thus, the only logical and reasonable interpretation, which is in accordance with the purposive of the Act and in line with the beneficial nature thereof would be that a judgment-debtor of a decree envisages in Clauses a , b and c of sub-section 2 of Section 14 of the Act of 1964, would not have a right of appeal so that the disputes mentioned therein are resolved expeditiously and the benefits conferred through such decree reach the decree-holder without being frustrated. However, the said provision cannot be interpreted so as to exclude a right of appeal to a wife whose claim of dower or dowry has been partially or entirely declined. For such an CA.14-L/2013 10 interpretation, would defeat the purpose and object of the Act of 1964 and frustrate its beneficial nature. 14. This Court while interpreting Section 14 2 of the Act of 1964, in its judgment reported as Tayyaba Yunus v. Muhammad Ehsan and others 2010 SCMR 1403 held that where a Suit for dower has been dismissed, the wife has a right of appeal under Section 14 2 of the above-said Act of 1964. 15. In a case pertaining to dissolution of marriage, this Court in the judgment reported as Abid Hussain v. Additional District Judge, Alipur, District Muzaffargarh and another 2006 SCMR 100 held as follows: The object behind non-provision of appeal in case of dissolution of marriage is to protect women, an under privileged and generally oppressed section of our society from prolonged and costly litigation. It aims to put a clog on the right of husband. 16. Thus, the only possible purposive beneficial and rational interpretation of Section 14 2 of the Act of 1964, is that the right of appeal of a husband against whom a decree has been passed is curtailed, CA.14-L/2013 1 if the amount awarded is less than the amount, which is mentioned in the said provision. However, in no event the right of the wife to file an appeal is extinguished if she is dissatisfied with any decree in a Suit for dower or dowry. 17. The aforesaid view incidentally has also been consistently enunciated by the learned Lahore High Court in the judgments reported as Ghulam Rasool v. Senior Civil Judge and 4 others PLJ 2008 Lahore 531 , Saeeda Alia v. Syed Ghulam Mursalin Naqvi and another 2004 MLD 306 and Mst. Neelam Nosheen and others v. Raja Muhammad Khagaan and others 2002 MLD 784 . 18. In this view of the matter, there is no denial of fact that the appeal of Respondent No.3 was validly filed and the learned First Appellate Court was vested with the jurisdiction to adjudicate thereupon and such jurisdiction was not barred under Section 14 2 of the Act of 1964. In view of the above, this Civil Appeal is totally devoid of merit and is liable to be dismissed. CA.14-L/2013 12 19.

Federal Shariat Court has been instilled in our Constitution\nthrough amendment Ordinance, 1980 in the Constitution of Pakistan,\n1973 in Part VII, whole new chapter 3A (Article 203A to 203J) was\nadded, installing Federal Shariat Court and Shariat Appellate Bench in\nthe Supreme Court. Federal Shariat Court on its own motion or on the\npetition of a citizen of Pakistan or the Federal or Provincial Government\nexamine existing law and or any provision thereof is in conformity and\nnot repugnant to Injunction of Holy Quran and Sunnah of the Holy\nProphet (PBUH). Limit and extent of original jurisdiction of the Federal\nShariat Court is well defined in terms of Article 203D of the Constitution\n\nof Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 which reads as follow:\n\n203D. (1) The Court may, either of its own motion or on\nthe petition of a citizen of Pakistan or the Federal\nGovernment or a Provincial Government, examine and\ndecide the question whether or not any law or provision of\nlaw is repugnant to the Injunctions of Islam, as laid down\nin the Holy Quran and the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet,\n\nhereinafter referred to as the Injunctions of Islam.\n\n(1A) Where the Court takes up the examination of\n\nany law or provision of law under clause (1) and such law\n\nCivil Shariat Appeal No.1 of 2013\n\nor provision of law appears to it to be repugnant to the\nInjunctions of Islam, the Court shall cause to be given to\nthe Federal Government in the case of a law with respect\nto a matter in the Federal Legislative List or to the\nProvincial Government in the case of a law with respect to\na matter not enumerated [in the Federal Legislative List],\na notice specifying the particular provisions that appear to\nit to be so repugnant, and afford to such Government\nadequate opportunity to have its point of view placed\n\nbefore the Court.\n\n(2) If the Court decides that any law or provision of\nlaw is repugnant to the Injunctions of Islam, it shall set out\n\nin its decision:\n(a) the reasons for its holding that opinion; and\n\n(b) the extent to which such law or provision is so\n\nrepugnant;\nand specify the day on which the decision shall take effect.\n\nProvided that no such decision shall be deemed to\ntake effect before the expiration of the period within which\nan appeal therefrom may be preferred to the Supreme\nCourt or, where an appeal has been so preferred, before\n\nthe disposal of such appeal.\n\n(3) If any law or provision of law is held by the\n\nCourt to be repugnant to the Injunctions of Islam: -\n\n(a) _ the President in the case of a law with respect\nto a matter in the Federal Legislative List or\nthe Governor in the case of a law with respect\nto a matter not enumerated in [said List] shall\ntake steps to amend the law so as to bring\nsuch law or provision into conformity with the\n\nInjunctions of Islam; and\n\n(b) such law or provision shall, to the extent to\n\nwhich it is held to be so repugnant, cease to\n\nCivil Shariat Appeal No.1 of 2013 6\n\nhave effect on the day on which the decision\nof the Court takes effect.\n\n8. Article 203D, as reproduced above, clearly set down the\noriginal jurisdiction of the Federal Shariat Court, to the extent of\nexamining the statute laws, custom or usage having force of law,\nincluding statutory rules, regulations framed thereunder on the\ntouchstone of Injunctions of Islam and issuance of declaration in\nrelation thereto, however Constitution, Muslim Personal Laws, fiscal law\nand law of procedure of any Court as mentioned in Clause (c) of Article\n\n203B ibid; are kept beyond the pale of its jurisdiction. [See Dr. M.\n\nAslam Khaki versus Syed Muhammad Hashim and 2 others (PLD 2000\n\nSupreme Court 225)].\n\n9. Having examined the Jurisdictional bounds of the Federal\nShariat Court, we have noted that the Federal Shariat Court has issued\na direction in the form of writ of mandamus as reproduced in paragraph\n\n3 above, which is clearly beyond its jurisdictional authority.\n\n10. Learned Bench of the Federal Shariat Court, fell into error,\ntreating Article 31(2) of the Constitution, as command of the\nConstitution or law capable of implementation by the Federal Shariat\nCourt. As discussed above, jurisdiction of Federal Shariat Court is\nconfined to the extent of examining the compatibility or otherwise of\nlaw (per Article 293B (c) ibid) on the touchstone of Injunctions of Islam. Once\na law or any provision thereof is held to be repugnant to Injunctions of\nIslam, by the Federal Shariat Court then it becomes the responsibility of\nthe appropriate legislature to harmonize it in accordance with\nInjunctions of Islam, otherwise declaration so made by the Federal\n\nShariat Court becomes effective on the day so specified in its decision.\n\nCivil Shariat Appeal No.1 of 2013 7\n\n11. It may be observed that Principles of Policy as embedded\n(Articles 29 to 40), infact are the guidelines for the State, stand alone,\nare not enforceable. Sub-Article (1) ibid on one hand places\nresponsibility on each organ and authority of State to strive to achieve\nthe same on the other sub Article (2) of Article 30 ibid insulates it\nagainst examination even by the High Courts and Supreme Court unless\nsame are translated into command of the Constitution and or law like\nArticle 141A, Article 10A, Article 25A, corresponding to Articles 32,\n37(d) and 37 (b) & (c) respectively grafted through 18\" Constitutional\nAmendment [For illustrative cases one may see Mehr Zulfiqar Ali Babu versus\nGovernment of the Punjab and others (PLD 1997 Supreme Court 11),\nPresident of Baluchistan High Court Bar Association versus Federation of\n\nPakistan and others (2012 SCMR 745) and Hafiz Abdul Waheed versus Mrs.\n\nAsma Jehangir and another (PLD 2004 Supreme Court 219)].\n\n12. As discussed above original jurisdiction of the Federal\nShariat Court is circumscribed by Article 203D of the Constitution, to\nthe extent of examining any law to be in conformity with Injunctions of\nIslam or otherwise. Federal Shariat Court has no jurisdiction to examine\nor be influenced by any proposed draft legislation, Bill \"the Teaching of\nHoly Quran and Arabic language, Act, 2009,” which has not yet been\ntranslated into the Act of Parliament nor possess any jurisdiction in the\nnature of Article 199 or 184(3) of the Constitution, for the enforcement\nof fundamental rights or to issue order, declaration or directions to\nimplement any command of the Constitution or law.

All the four Provinces were also directed to report the compliance, operative part contained in paragraph 6 of the impugned judgment runs as follows: Federation of Pakistan is directed that, under Article 31 2 a of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, Shariat Act, 1991 and the facts mentioned above, necessary steps, stated to be already under way, in certain respects in this regard, as mentioned above, Civil Shariat Appeal No.1 of 2013 3 be finalized early for promotion of Arabic language for the educational and other relevant systems. It should regularly be monitored in order to ensure positive progress on the same, to be submitted to the Cabinet within six months. 4.

(now Khyber\nPakhtunkhwa) acting through the Secretary Education issued\nnotification dated 1st August, 1983 by which the Government\nComprehensive High School Mardan was renamed as the Public\nSchool Mardan and transferred to it all lands, buildings,\nproperties, assets and liabilities of the former. On 3'¢ November,\n1985 the Secretary Education issued another notification changing\nthe name of the school again and also upgrading it; the Public\nSchool Mardan was now named after the incumbent Governor of\nthe Province and made into a college, the “Fazle Haq College\n\nMardan” (“the College”).\n\n2. The Government then decided to expand the College. On 24th\nOctober, 1985 the Collector, Mardan, District Mardan (“the\nCollector”) issued a notification under section 4 of the Land\nAcquisition Act, 1894 (“the Act”) identifying fifty five kanals and\nseventeen marlas of private land lying adjacent to the College\nwhich could be used for the College and authorized a preliminary\ninvestigation of the land. On 14th January, 1986 the Commissioner\nPeshawar Division (“the Commissioner”) issued a notification\nunder section 17 of the Act taking over the possession of the land\nand stating that the provisions of sections 5 and 54 of the Act will\nnot be applicable to the land. Nothing further happened for the\nnext ten years. On 23d January, 1996 the Commissioner issued a\nnotification under section 6 of the Act declaring that the land was\nrequired for a public purpose and directed the Collector to make\n\nan order for its acquisition under section 7 of the Act.\n\n3. On 4th August, 1996 the Collector made his award (“the\nAward”) pursuant to section 11 of the Act and fixed the amount of\ncompensation payable to the owners of the land at the rate of Rs.\n1079.37 paisas (one thousand and seventy nine rupees and thirty\nseven paisas) per marla and fixed an amount of Rs. 21,994 (twenty\n\none thousand, nine hundred and ninety four rupees) as\n\nCA No. 79-P/13 etc. 3\n\ncompensation for the structures standing on the land. Fifteen per\ncent compulsory acquisition charges and eight per cent simple\ninterest was also awarded from 14th January, 1986. The Collector\nnoted that those from whom the land was acquired were left\nwithout access to their remaining lands and therefore carved out\nsix approach roads/pathways to access their lands, but excluded\nthe land falling under these approach roads/pathways for payment\nof compensation. Compensation was ordered to be paid only in\nrespect of the fifty-two kanals and fifteen marlas of land which had\n\nbeen acquired for the College (“the acquired land”).\n\n4. The owners (appellants in Civil Appeal No. 79-P/2013, “the\nprivate appellants”) were dissatisfied with the amount of the\ncompensation fixed by the Collector and filed a reference under\nsection 18 of the Act against the Award. They alleged that the\ncompensation fixed by the Collector was well below the market\nprice of Rs. 25,000 (twenty five thousand rupees) per marla and\nthe value of the construction on two kanals of the acquired land\nwas Rs. 2,000,000 (two million rupees). They however conceded\nthat the law envisaged six per cent interest per annum (instead of\neight per cent interest as given in the Award). On 8» June, 2004\nthe reference was partly accepted by the learned Judge Land\nAcquisition who increased the price of the acquired land per marla\nto Rs. 4,500 (four thousand and five hundred rupees) per marla,\nreduced the interest per annum to six per cent and maintained the\nfifteen per cent compulsory acquisition charges; the compensation\nwas payable from the date that the possession of the land was\ntaken. Thereafter, both sides filed regular first appeals (“RFAs”) in\nthe Peshawar High Court, Peshawar against the judgment of the\nlearned Judge Land Acquisition. In the RFAs the High Court\nmaintained the compensation that had been determined by the\nlearned Judge Land Acquisition, however, the learned Single Judge\nwas pleased to award the cost of litigation to the private appellants.\nBoth sides then appealed to this Court. The private appellants seek\nenhancement of compensation amount to Rs. 25,000 (twenty five\n\nthousand rupees) per marla and Rs. 2,000,000 (two million rupees)\n\nCA No. 79-P/13 etc. 4\n\nfor the said construction. The official appellants (who have filed\nCivil Appeal Nos. 143-P to 146-P/2013) state that compensation as\ndetermined by the Collector in the Award be reverted to.\n\n5. The learned counsel for the private appellants (in Civil\nAppeal No. 79-P/2013) submitted as under:\n\n(i) Evidence was produced to show the sale and purchase\ntransactions at the rate of Rs. 10,000 (ten thousand\nrupees) per marla during the relevant period;\n\n(ii) The acquired land is situated on a main road and has\nthe potential of considerable increase in value;\n\n(iii) The Award was made ten and a half years after the\npossession of the land was taken over and during this\nperiod the price of the land had gone up considerably;\n\n(iv) |The owners remained deprived of the use of their land\ntill the Award was made;\n\n(v) For similar land compensation was determined at six\nthousand rupees per marla by the Collector in the\naward dated 12t» April, 1984 which was maintained by\nthis Court on 17th December, 1992;\n\n(vi) The owners were entitled to additional compensation\nmentioned in section 48-A of the Act (inserted by the\nN.W.F.P. Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act, V of\n1987) but they were not granted it; and\n\n(vi) The land falling under the approach roads/pathways\nshould not have been excluded from the payment of\ncompensation since it could only be used as approach\n\nroads/pathways.\n\nThe learned counsel relied upon the cases of Murad Khan v\nLand Acquisition Collector (1999 SCMR 1647), Province of Punjab v.\nJamil Ahmad Malik (2000 SCMR 870) and Province of Punjab v\nBegum Aziza (2014 SCMR 75).\n\n6. Mr. Mujahid Ali Khan, the learned Additional Advocate\nGeneral (“AAG”), and Mr. Amjad Ali, the learned counsel for the\n\nCA No. 79-P/13 etc. 5\n\nCollege, opposed the appeal filed by the private appellants and\nsupported the appeals filed by the College. They stated that\ncompensation was determined by the Collector after he had\npersonally visited the acquired land and the Award was made in\naccordance with the prevailing market price and the law.\nTherefore, the learned Judge Land Acquisition was not justified to\nincrease the compensation amount. As regards the delay in\nmaking the Award, they stated that the additional six per cent\ninterest per annum payable to the owners sufficiently compensates\n\nthem, therefore, the delay in making the Award is inconsequential.\n\n7. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and with\ntheir able assistance examined the record. Section 23 of the Act\nstipulates the matters to be considered in determining\ncompensation. In the Province of Khyber Pukhtunkhwa section 48-\nA of the Act has been added which states that the owner of land\nwill also be entitled to damages suffered if the award is not made\nwithin a year of the declaration under section 6 of the Act. Section\n48-A is reproduced hereunder:\n\n“Compensation to be awarded when land not acquired within\n\none year: (1) If within a period of one year from the date of\n\npublication of declaration under Section 6 in respect of any land,\n\nthe Collector has not made an award under Section 11 in respect\n\nto such land, the owner of the land shall, unless he has been to a\n\nmaterial extent responsible for the delay, be entitled to receive\n\ncompensation for the damage suffered by him in consequence of\n\nthe delay.\n\n(2) The provisions of Part II of this Act shall apply, so far as\n\nmay be possible, to the determination of the compensation\n\npayable under this section.”\n\n8. There has been an unjustifiable delay in making the Award.\nThe declaration (under section 6 of the Act) was made on 14th\nJanuary, 1986 and the Award was made ten and a half years later\non 4th August, 1996. The Act envisages an award to be made\nwithin a year. Article 24 (1) of the Constitution of the Islamic\n\nRepublic of Pakistan (“the Constitution”) stipulates that, “No\n\nCA No. 79-P/13 etc. 6\n\nperson shall be deprived of his property save in accordance with\nlaw.” And, Article 24 (2) of the Constitution mandates the payment\nof compensation for land compulsorily acquired. Depriving a\nperson of property is an exception to the fundamental right to hold\nand enjoy property. The owner must be promptly compensated for\nthe compulsorily acquired property. The designated authority (the\nCollector) had to determine the compensation payable to the\nprivate appellants within a year but failed to do so and instead\ntook ten and a half years to make the Award. The learned High\nCourt Judge had noted that the price of the land had increased on\naccount of the depreciation - devaluation of the rupee and further\nthat the owners could not utilize their land during the time it took\nto make the Award. However, he did not increase the compensation\namount despite also having observed that, “the affectees are\nrequired to be compensated to some reasonable extent, deemed\n\nappropriate and justiciable in the circumstances of the case.”\n\n9. The learned Judge Land Acquisition, in deciding whether the\nowners were entitled to be compensated as sought by the owners\n(Issue No. 5), had noted that the acquired land was situated on the\nmain road and also had commercial value as it was situated in the\nvicinity of Haroon Surgical Hospital, the Government Commerce\nCollege, Mardan and the Office of the Forest Officer, Mardan. He\nhad also referred to evidence and the exhibited documents,\nincluding the fard jamabandi for the year 1994-95 produced by\nPatwari Halqa and the mutations of lands in the area showing the\nprice of land to be ten thousand rupees per marla at the relevant\ntime. He had also referred to the judgment wherein the\ncompensation in respect of land acquired in the same area a few\nyears previously was fixed at Rs. 6,000 (six thousand rupees) per\nmarla. However, despite noting these facts, which had remained\nun-rebutted, he increased the compensation to only Rs. 4,500 per\nmarla. The learned Judge of the High Court had also disregarded\nthe evidence on record, though he had noted the price had\nincreased and had expressed his sympathy with the private\n\nappellants.\n\nCA No. 79-P/ 13 etc. 7\n\n10. To get a better understanding of the location of the acquired\nland and of the said approach roads/pathways we had directed the\nCollege, “to file photographs of the land that was acquired and the\naccess to the remaining land of the persons from whom it was\nacquired.” The photographs filed by the College confirm that the\nland falling under the approach roads/pathways cannot be used\nfor any other purpose. When the use of such land is restricted in\nthis manner then the value of such land stands diminished, but no\n\ncompensation has been awarded for such land.\n\n11. This Court in the case of Murad Khan v Land Acquisition\nCollector (1999 SCMR 1647) with regard to determining the\ncompensation of land had considered the matters mentioned in\nsection 23 of the Act and the scope of the expression market-value\nmentioned therein. Muhammad Bashir Jehangiri, J writing for a\nthree-member Bench of this Court reviewed the case law\ncomprehensively and derived the principles therefrom (paragraph\n13, pages 1654-1657). This seminal judgment has_ been\ncontinuously followed by this Court, including in the cited cases of\nProvince of Punjab v. Jamil Ahmad Malik (2000 SCMR 870) and\nProvince of Punjab v Begum Aziza (2014 SCMR 75). Applying\nsection 23 of the Act and the principles expounded in the case of\nMurad Khan the compensation payable to the private appellants\n\nneeds to be revised.\n\n12. The market-value of the acquired land at the relevant time as\nper the evidence on record was Rs. 10,000 (ten thousand rupees)\nper marla. The owners of the acquired land therefore had to be\ncompensated at the rate of Rs. 10,000 (ten thousand rupees) per\nmarla together with fifteen per cent compulsory acquisition\ncharges and six per cent interest per annum from the date of\ntaking possession of the acquired land, that is from 14 January,\n\n1986.\n\nCA No. 79-P/13 etc. 8\n\nThe private appellants will also be entitled to receive\ncompensation for the land used in approach roads/pathways,\nmeasuring 2 kanals, 9 marlas and 7 sersais (as mentioned in the\nAward) since the value of such land had diminished because it\ncould only be used as approach roads/pathways. However,\nevidence with regard to the reduction in the value of such land is\nnot available. It has been decades since the land was acquired and\nthe approach roads/pathways were created, therefore, it would not\nnow be appropriate to remand the matter for the determination in\nthe reduction in the value of such land. This land also constitutes\na very small portion of the acquired land. Accordingly, we fix the\ncompensation for the reduction in the value of the land used in the\napproach roads/pathways at Rs. 5,000 (five thousand rupees),\n\nwhich is half the compensation payable for the acquired land.\n\nAs regards the “abad houses on an area of 2 kanals of land”\nthe owners had valued the same at Rs. 2,000,000 (two million\nrupees), however, in the Award these are valued at Rs. 21,994\n(twenty one thousand, nine hundred and ninety four rupees). The\nAward doesn’t mention the nature of such construction nor how its\nprice was determined, instead the Collector relied on the value as\ndetermined by the Patwari. Taking into account the value of the\nland, the area on which the construction was raised and when it\nmust have been raised (that is before the possession of the land\nwas taken over) we think that it would be valued at Rs. 200,000\n\n(two hundred thousand rupees) at the relevant time.\n\n13. Since the owners of the acquired area had not established\nthat they had suffered damages on account of the delay in making\nthe Award beyond the period of one year, therefore, they are not\nentitled to receive additional compensation under section 48-A of\n\nthe Act.\n\n14. The compensation therefore payable by the\nCollege/Collector/Government of Khyber Pakhtunkwa to the\n\nowners of the land (the private appellants herein) is as under:\n\nCA No. 79-P/13 etc. 9\n\n(a) Compensation for the acquired land at the rate of Rs.\n\n10,000 (ten thousand rupees) per marla;\n\n(b) The reduction in the value of 2 kanal, 9 marlas and 7\nsersais of land utilized for the approach roads/pathways,\nbeing at the rate of Rs. 5,000 (five thousand rupees) per\n\nmarla;\n\n(c) Compensation for the value of the construction to be Rs.\n\n200,000 (two hundred thousand rupees); and\n\n(d) The cost of litigation granted by the High Court.\n\n15. For the reasons mentioned above Civil Appeals No. 79-P of\n2013 is partly allowed in the aforesaid terms and Civil Appeal Nos.\n143-P to 146-P of 2013 are dismissed. The order whereby\n\njudgment in these appeals was reserved had concluded as under:\n\n“... After the announcement of the judgment in these appeals the\noffice is directed to send the files to the principal seat of this\nCourt at Islamabad for determination of the question noted in the\n\nfollowing paragraph.\n\n2. The learned counsel for the College informed us that\npreviously the College was known as the Government\nComprehensive School and the land on which it stood was owned\nby the Government, however, subsequently the said School was\nconverted into the College and was named after General Fazal\nHaq, the then Governor of the Province, when he was in office.\nThe question arises whether the College which was built on\nGovernment land and constructed out of public funds and for\nwhich land compulsorily acquired had been paid out of public\nfunds can be named after a living person and one who held public\noffice in Pakistan. The learned counsel for the College is directed\nto submit concise statement in this regard and attach therein all\ndocuments pertaining to the naming of the College. The learned\nAdvocate General, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa seeks time to take\ninstructions and to formulate his views on the noted question.\nSince our decision in respect of the matter of naming the College\n\nmay affect the naming of public buildings, public parks, public\n\nCA No. 79-P/13 etc. 10\n\nroads and other public places not only in the province of the\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa but also in other parts of Pakistan notices\nbe issued to the Advocate Generals of all the four provinces, the\nIslamabad Capital Territory and the Attorney General for\nPakistan, all of whom are directed to file their respective written\nsubmissions within six weeks, whereafter the matter be fixed in\n\nCourt for hearing.”\n\n16.

The Government of N.W.F.P. now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa acting through the Secretary Education issued notification dated 1st August, 1983 by which the Government Comprehensive High School Mardan was renamed as the Public School Mardan and transferred to it all lands, buildings, properties, assets and liabilities of the former.

The Government then decided to expand the College. On 24th October, 1985 the Collector, Mardan, District Mardan the Collector issued a notification under section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 the Act identifying fifty five kanals and seventeen marlas of private land lying adjacent to the College which could be used for the College and authorized a preliminary investigation of the land. On 14th January, 1986 the Commissioner Peshawar Division the Commissioner issued a notification under section 17 of the Act taking over the possession of the land and stating that the provisions of sections 5 and 54 of the Act will not be applicable to the land. Nothing further happened for the next ten years. On 23d January, 1996 the Commissioner issued a notification under section 6 of the Act declaring that the land was required for a public purpose and directed the Collector to make an order for its acquisition under section 7 of the Act. 3. On 4th August, 1996 the Collector made his award the Award pursuant to section 11 of the Act and fixed the amount of compensation payable to the owners of the land at the rate of Rs. 1079.37 paisas one thousand and seventy nine rupees and thirty seven paisas per marla and fixed an amount of Rs. 21,994 twenty one thousand, nine hundred and ninety four rupees as CA No. 79-P/13 etc. 3 compensation for the structures standing on the land. Fifteen per cent compulsory acquisition charges and eight per cent simple interest was also awarded from 14th January, 1986. The Collector noted that those from whom the land was acquired were left without access to their remaining lands and therefore carved out six approach roads/pathways to access their lands, but excluded the land falling under these approach roads/pathways for payment of compensation. Compensation was ordered to be paid only in respect of the fifty-two kanals and fifteen marlas of land which had been acquired for the College the acquired land . 4. The owners appellants in Civil Appeal No. 79-P/2013, the private appellants were dissatisfied with the amount of the compensation fixed by the Collector and filed a reference under section 18 of the Act against the Award. They alleged that the compensation fixed by the Collector was well below the market price of Rs. 25,000 twenty five thousand rupees per marla and the value of the construction on two kanals of the acquired land was Rs. 2,000,000 two million rupees . They however conceded that the law envisaged six per cent interest per annum instead of eight per cent interest as given in the Award . On 8 June, 2004 the reference was partly accepted by the learned Judge Land Acquisition who increased the price of the acquired land per marla to Rs. 4,500 four thousand and five hundred rupees per marla, reduced the interest per annum to six per cent and maintained the fifteen per cent compulsory acquisition charges; the compensation was payable from the date that the possession of the land was taken. Thereafter, both sides filed regular first appeals RFAs in the Peshawar High Court, Peshawar against the judgment of the learned Judge Land Acquisition. In the RFAs the High Court maintained the compensation that had been determined by the learned Judge Land Acquisition, however, the learned Single Judge was pleased to award the cost of litigation to the private appellants. Both sides then appealed to this Court. The private appellants seek enhancement of compensation amount to Rs. 25,000 twenty five thousand rupees per marla and Rs. 2,000,000 two million rupees CA No. 79-P/13 etc. 4 for the said construction. The official appellants who have filed Civil Appeal Nos. 143-P to 146-P/2013 state that compensation as determined by the Collector in the Award be reverted to. 5. The learned counsel for the private appellants in Civil Appeal No. 79-P/2013 submitted as under: i Evidence was produced to show the sale and purchase transactions at the rate of Rs. 10,000 ten thousand rupees per marla during the relevant period; ii The acquired land is situated on a main road and has the potential of considerable increase in value; iii The Award was made ten and a half years after the possession of the land was taken over and during this period the price of the land had gone up considerably; iv The owners remained deprived of the use of their land till the Award was made; v For similar land compensation was determined at six thousand rupees per marla by the Collector in the award dated 12t April, 1984 which was maintained by this Court on 17th December, 1992; vi The owners were entitled to additional compensation mentioned in section 48-A of the Act inserted by the N.W.F.P. Land Acquisition Amendment Act, V of 1987 but they were not granted it; and vi The land falling under the approach roads/pathways should not have been excluded from the payment of compensation since it could only be used as approach roads/pathways. The learned counsel relied upon the cases of Murad Khan v Land Acquisition Collector 1999 SCMR 1647 , Province of Punjab v. Jamil Ahmad Malik 2000 SCMR 870 and Province of Punjab v Begum Aziza 2014 SCMR 75 . 6.

In the Province of Khyber Pukhtunkhwa section 48A of the Act has been added which states that the owner of land will also be entitled to damages suffered if the award is not made within a year of the declaration under section 6 of the Act. Section 48-A is reproduced hereunder: Compensation to be awarded when land not acquired within one year: 1 If within a period of one year from the date of publication of declaration under Section 6 in respect of any land, the Collector has not made an award under Section 11 in respect to such land, the owner of the land shall, unless he has been to a material extent responsible for the delay, be entitled to receive compensation for the damage suffered by him in consequence of the delay. 2 The provisions of Part II of this Act shall apply, so far as may be possible, to the determination of the compensation payable under this section. 8.

Applying section 23 of the Act and the principles expounded in the case of Murad Khan the compensation payable to the private appellants needs to be revised. 12. The market-value of the acquired land at the relevant time as per the evidence on record was Rs. 10,000 ten thousand rupees per marla. The owners of the acquired land therefore had to be compensated at the rate of Rs. 10,000 ten thousand rupees per marla together with fifteen per cent compulsory acquisition charges and six per cent interest per annum from the date of taking possession of the acquired land, that is from 14 January, 1986. CA No. 79-P/13 etc. 8 The private appellants will also be entitled to receive compensation for the land used in approach roads/pathways, measuring 2 kanals, 9 marlas and 7 sersais as mentioned in the Award since the value of such land had diminished because it could only be used as approach roads/pathways. However, evidence with regard to the reduction in the value of such land is not available. It has been decades since the land was acquired and the approach roads/pathways were created, therefore, it would not now be appropriate to remand the matter for the determination in the reduction in the value of such land. This land also constitutes a very small portion of the acquired land. Accordingly, we fix the compensation for the reduction in the value of the land used in the approach roads/pathways at Rs. 5,000 five thousand rupees , which is half the compensation payable for the acquired land. As regards the abad houses on an area of 2 kanals of land the owners had valued the same at Rs. 2,000,000 two million rupees , however, in the Award these are valued at Rs. 21,994 twenty one thousand, nine hundred and ninety four rupees . The Award doesn t mention the nature of such construction nor how its price was determined, instead the Collector relied on the value as determined by the Patwari. Taking into account the value of the land, the area on which the construction was raised and when it must have been raised that is before the possession of the land was taken over we think that it would be valued at Rs. 200,000 two hundred thousand rupees at the relevant time. 13. Since the owners of the acquired area had not established that they had suffered damages on account of the delay in making the Award beyond the period of one year, therefore, they are not entitled to receive additional compensation under section 48-A of the Act. 14. The compensation therefore payable by the College/Collector/Government of Khyber Pakhtunkwa to the owners of the land the private appellants herein is as under: CA No. 79-P/13 etc. 9 a Compensation for the acquired land at the rate of Rs. 10,000 ten thousand rupees per marla; b The reduction in the value of 2 kanal, 9 marlas and 7 sersais of land utilized for the approach roads/pathways, being at the rate of Rs. 5,000 five thousand rupees per marla; c Compensation for the value of the construction to be Rs. 200,000 two hundred thousand rupees ; and d The cost of litigation granted by the High Court. 15. For the reasons mentioned above Civil Appeals No. 79-P of 2013 is partly allowed in the aforesaid terms and Civil Appeal Nos. 143-P to 146-P of 2013 are dismissed. The order whereby judgment in these appeals was reserved had concluded as under: ... After the announcement of the judgment in these appeals the office is directed to send the files to the principal seat of this Court at Islamabad for determination of the question noted in the following paragraph. 2. The learned counsel for the College informed us that previously the College was known as the Government Comprehensive School and the land on which it stood was owned by the Government, however, subsequently the said School was converted into the College and was named after General Fazal Haq, the then Governor of the Province, when he was in office. The question arises whether the College which was built on Government land and constructed out of public funds and for which land compulsorily acquired had been paid out of public funds can be named after a living person and one who held public office in Pakistan. The learned counsel for the College is directed to submit concise statement in this regard and attach therein all documents pertaining to the naming of the College. The learned Advocate General, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa seeks time to take instructions and to formulate his views on the noted question. Since our decision in respect of the matter of naming the College may affect the naming of public buildings, public parks, public CA No. 79-P/13 etc. 10 roads and other public places not only in the province of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa but also in other parts of Pakistan notices be issued to the Advocate Generals of all the four provinces, the Islamabad Capital Territory and the Attorney General for Pakistan, all of whom are directed to file their respective written submissions within six weeks, whereafter the matter be fixed in Court for hearing. 16. After the announcement of this judgment the office is directed to fix the aforenoted question for consideration of this Court as per the orders of the Hon ble Chief Justice.

As\nsuch, the system of ‘First Past the Post’\nviolates the principle of majority.

Prima facie, it seems that Ranger is equally\nresponsible if any incident takes place. However we direct the\nofficer who appeared before us that he should place on record\ncopies of the notifications extended from time to time and also\nensure that Major General Rizwan Akhtar DG Rangers attends\nthe court at 11.30 a.m.\n\n2. Major General Rizwan Akhtar appeared and stated\nthat under Section 5 of the Anti Terrorism Act 1997 his force is\nrequired to prevent commission of terrorist acts or scheduled\noffences. It is to be noted that in the Province of Sindh Rangers\nis deployed from 1995 to onward to perform their duties.\nWhereas, w.e.f. 25\" August 2011 powers of police have also\nbeen conferred upon it so that they may cause arrest etc. of the\naccused persons. He also informed that at present 11000 troops\nof Rangers have been deployed in Karachi City and efforts are\nbeing made to prevent the terrorism. It is to be noted that in\npresence of considerable good number of troops of Rangers\ncrime of terrorism and other offences referred to in the Schedule\nof the Act 1997 have not been controlled or prevented despite of\nthe fact that the Rangers has got its own system, though at a\nsmall scale, to gather secret informations about the commission\nof the terrorism etc. He also admitted that regarding incident of\nAbbas Town dated 03.03.2013 no secret information was\n\nreceived by his force, except that there was generalized\n\ninformation about the happening of the incident. On our query,\nhe stated that the troops deployed near the place of incident\ncould not reach for the assistance of the victims on account of\nprotest launched by the inhabitants of the area and other\npersons who had gathered there in the meanwhile.\n\nWhen we enquired from him as to whether any detail of\nthe report has been transmitted to the Secretary Interior,\nGovernment of Pakistan, he replied in affirmative and promised\nto place on record the report on the next date. Similarly when\nwe enquired from him as to whether any action has been taken\nagainst the officials/officers failing in preventing the terrorism in\nAbbas Town, he stated that no such action was required to be\ntaken because the officers, who were posted there, had been\nperforming well in the past.\n\n3. Be that as it may, this aspect of the case would be\nconsidered later on as prima facie it seems that despite of failing\nto prevent the commission of terrorism no effective step by\ninitiating action against the persons posted over there had been\ntaken by him. He is directed to submit a detailed reply about the\nincident of Abbas Town, dated 03.03.2013, and also explain that\nas to why in presence of the notification under Section 5 of the\nAct 1997, Rangers had failed to prevent the commission of\nterrorism and other offences mentioned in the schedule,\nparticularly when the police powers had also been conferred\nupon the Force for the purpose of arresting and conducing raids\nto cause the arrest of the accused persons, on the next date of\n\nhearing.\n\n4. Mr. Anwar Mansoor Khan, learned Sr. ASC appeared\non behalf of the Provincial Government and stated that after\nhearing of the case, he has contacted to the Chief Minister Sindh\nwho has communicated to him that on account of the fact that\nthe Inspector General Police is a Grade-22 Officer, therefore, he\nhas been surrendered to the Federal Government, similar is the\nsituation with the DIG and the SSP will be transferred to the\nHeadquarters and appropriate action will be taken.\n\nThe learned counsel may produce the notification of the\nsurrender of both these officers, i.e. IGP (Fiaz Leghari) and DIG\nEast (Aleem Jafri) to the Federal Government during the course\nof the day by supplying a copy to the Incharge Branch Registry\n\nfor our perusal in Chamber.\n\n5. It is to be noted that this Court in the case of Watan\n\nParty & another v. Federation of Pakistan and others (PLD 2011\n\nSC 997), which is generally known as Karachi Killing and Law\nand Orders Case, delivered judgment on 06.10.2011, and, inter\nalia, observed as under:\n\n“55. It is to be noted that, primarily it is the duty of\nthe Province through its executive authorities to\ncontrol the law and order situation and ensure\nimplementation of Fundamental Rights of citizens.\nBut prima facie it seems that the Provincial\nAuthorities have not fulfilled their constitutional duty.\nUnder the Constitution, equally it is the obligation of\nthe Federation to protect every Province against\ninternal disturbances as well as external aggression\nand to ensure that the Government of every Province\nis carried on in accordance with the provisions of the\nConstitution.”\n\n6. It is a matter of great concern that despite of\n\ncategorical observation made hereinabove, situation of law and\n\norder has not been improved in Karachi, for which no one else\nexcept the Provincial Government/Executives are responsible.\nThe citizens/general public of Karachi constantly are being\ndenied their fundamental rights of life and security in terms of\nArticle 9 of the Constitution. We were hopeful that in view of the\nabove observations situation of law and order would have been\nimproved but here the position is altogether different. The target\nkillings, kidnapping for ransom, Bhatta and terrorism have\nincreased day by day. It is unfortunate that despite of happening\nof the instant incident and all the incidents which had been taken\nplace earlier, no action against the responsible police officers and\nRangers had been taken, may be for the reason known to the\n\nProvincial Government/high-ups of the Rangers.\n\n7. Any way we have prima facie noticed that during the\nhappening of the incident of Abbas Town no one from the\nposition of the constable to I.G.P. Sindh and Rangers reached at\nthe place of incident immediately, whereas the material/report\nwhich has been made available by the Media the inhabitants of\nthe area on their own had been helping to each other. Primarily,\nit was the duty of the Law Enforcing Agencies, both Police as well\nas Rangers, to prevent the commission of happening of such\noffences and if at all on account of their negligence the incident\nhad taken place, they could have at least extended helping hand\nto the victims but they have failed to do so. Admittedly, 50\npersons had lost their lives and a good number of flats and\nshops both situated in Iqra City and Rabia Flower Plaza have\n\nbeen destroyed, peoples of the area are lying under the open\n\nsky but so far administration has not moved at all in any manner\nas no action against any police officers or rangers had taken. We\nare reluctant to hold that the manner in which the incident had\ntaken place and subsequent thereto as the Executive behaved\nwith the victims etc. is highly unconstitutional, unlawful and\nillegal. Action was required to be taken immediately against the\nIncharge Police officers right starting from I.G.P. to SHO\ninasmuch as, SSP, DSP, etc. had not been proceeded against so\n\nfar.\n\n8. In the circumstances, we direct the Chief Secretary,\nGovernment of Sindh, being the head of the Executive that\nimmediately suspend SSP, DSP and SHO and issue such\nnotification during the course of the day. They also be directed\nto join interrogation on account of their criminal negligence in\nnot providing the assistance to the inhabitants. The notification\nshould be also sent for our perusal in Chamber.\n\n9. We have been told that Mr. Iqbal Mehmood, CCPO,\nKarachi was also not present there and Mr. Shabbir Shaikh, Addl.\nIGP was holding the charge. The Chief Secretary is directed to\nlook into his conduct as well with reference to instant case and\nsend report to us on the next date of hearing.

Prima facie, it seems that Ranger is equally responsible if any incident takes place. However we direct the officer who appeared before us that he should place on record copies of the notifications extended from time to time and also ensure that Major General Rizwan Akhtar DG Rangers attends the court at 11.30 a.m. 2. Major General Rizwan Akhtar appeared and stated that under Section 5 of the Anti Terrorism Act 1997 his force is required to prevent commission of terrorist acts or scheduled offences. It is to be noted that in the Province of Sindh Rangers is deployed from 1995 to onward to perform their duties. Whereas, w.e.f. 25 August 2011 powers of police have also been conferred upon it so that they may cause arrest etc. of the accused persons. He also informed that at present 11000 troops of Rangers have been deployed in Karachi City and efforts are being made to prevent the terrorism. It is to be noted that in presence of considerable good number of troops of Rangers crime of terrorism and other offences referred to in the Schedule of the Act 1997 have not been controlled or prevented despite of the fact that the Rangers has got its own system, though at a small scale, to gather secret informations about the commission of the terrorism etc. He also admitted that regarding incident of Abbas Town dated 03.03.2013 no secret information was received by his force, except that there was generalized information about the happening of the incident. On our query, he stated that the troops deployed near the place of incident could not reach for the assistance of the victims on account of protest launched by the inhabitants of the area and other persons who had gathered there in the meanwhile. When we enquired from him as to whether any detail of the report has been transmitted to the Secretary Interior, Government of Pakistan, he replied in affirmative and promised to place on record the report on the next date. Similarly when we enquired from him as to whether any action has been taken against the officials/officers failing in preventing the terrorism in Abbas Town, he stated that no such action was required to be taken because the officers, who were posted there, had been performing well in the past. 3. Be that as it may, this aspect of the case would be considered later on as prima facie it seems that despite of failing to prevent the commission of terrorism no effective step by initiating action against the persons posted over there had been taken by him. He is directed to submit a detailed reply about the incident of Abbas Town, dated 03.03.2013, and also explain that as to why in presence of the notification under Section 5 of the Act 1997, Rangers had failed to prevent the commission of terrorism and other offences mentioned in the schedule, particularly when the police powers had also been conferred upon the Force for the purpose of arresting and conducing raids to cause the arrest of the accused persons, on the next date of hearing. 4. Mr. Anwar Mansoor Khan, learned Sr. ASC appeared on behalf of the Provincial Government and stated that after hearing of the case, he has contacted to the Chief Minister Sindh who has communicated to him that on account of the fact that the Inspector General Police is a Grade-22 Officer, therefore, he has been surrendered to the Federal Government, similar is the situation with the DIG and the SSP will be transferred to the Headquarters and appropriate action will be taken. The learned counsel may produce the notification of the surrender of both these officers, i.e. IGP Fiaz Leghari and DIG East Aleem Jafri to the Federal Government during the course of the day by supplying a copy to the Incharge Branch Registry for our perusal in Chamber. 5. It is to be noted that this Court in the case of Watan Party another v. Federation of Pakistan and others PLD 2011 SC 997 , which is generally known as Karachi Killing and Law and Orders Case, delivered judgment on 06.10.2011, and, inter alia, observed as under: 55. It is to be noted that, primarily it is the duty of the Province through its executive authorities to control the law and order situation and ensure implementation of Fundamental Rights of citizens. But prima facie it seems that the Provincial Authorities have not fulfilled their constitutional duty. Under the Constitution, equally it is the obligation of the Federation to protect every Province against internal disturbances as well as external aggression and to ensure that the Government of every Province is carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. 6. It is a matter of great concern that despite of categorical observation made hereinabove, situation of law and order has not been improved in Karachi, for which no one else except the Provincial Government/Executives are responsible. The citizens/general public of Karachi constantly are being denied their fundamental rights of life and security in terms of Article 9 of the Constitution. We were hopeful that in view of the above observations situation of law and order would have been improved but here the position is altogether different. The target killings, kidnapping for ransom, Bhatta and terrorism have increased day by day. It is unfortunate that despite of happening of the instant incident and all the incidents which had been taken place earlier, no action against the responsible police officers and Rangers had been taken, may be for the reason known to the Provincial Government/high-ups of the Rangers. 7. Any way we have prima facie noticed that during the happening of the incident of Abbas Town no one from the position of the constable to I.G.P. Sindh and Rangers reached at the place of incident immediately, whereas the material/report which has been made available by the Media the inhabitants of the area on their own had been helping to each other. Primarily, it was the duty of the Law Enforcing Agencies, both Police as well as Rangers, to prevent the commission of happening of such offences and if at all on account of their negligence the incident had taken place, they could have at least extended helping hand to the victims but they have failed to do so. Admittedly, 50 persons had lost their lives and a good number of flats and shops both situated in Iqra City and Rabia Flower Plaza have been destroyed, peoples of the area are lying under the open sky but so far administration has not moved at all in any manner as no action against any police officers or rangers had taken. We are reluctant to hold that the manner in which the incident had taken place and subsequent thereto as the Executive behaved with the victims etc. is highly unconstitutional, unlawful and illegal. Action was required to be taken immediately against the Incharge Police officers right starting from I.G.P. to SHO inasmuch as, SSP, DSP, etc. had not been proceeded against so far. 8. In the circumstances, we direct the Chief Secretary, Government of Sindh, being the head of the Executive that immediately suspend SSP, DSP and SHO and issue such notification during the course of the day. They also be directed to join interrogation on account of their criminal negligence in not providing the assistance to the inhabitants. The notification should be also sent for our perusal in Chamber. 9. We have been told that Mr. Iqbal Mehmood, CCPO, Karachi was also not present there and Mr. Shabbir Shaikh, Addl. IGP was holding the charge. The Chief Secretary is directed to look into his conduct as well with reference to instant case and send report to us on the next date of hearing. If need be, we would also pass appropriate order in his case as well. 10. As DG Rangers requires time to file the reply/explanation, therefore, this case is fixed for 08.03.2013. In the meanwhile, we would direct the Federal Government through Secretary Interior as well as ISI, M.I. and I.B. to put up their reports through their counsel about happening of the incident particularly pointing out as to whether before the incident any information was communicated to the police, Rangers and if so, then we have to examine this aspect of the case as well. However, if need be some authorized officers may also be deputed for purpose of providing assistance to the Court.. CHIEF JUSTICE JUDGE Karachi, the Q6th March, 2013.

Similarly according to the\nstatement of Mr. Anwar Mansoor Khan, learned ASC for the\nProvincial Government, service of Mr. Fayyaz Ahmed Leghari,\nI.G.P. and Mr. Aleem Jafri, D.I.G. have been surrendered to the\nFederal Government vide notification No.SOIII(S&GAD)POL-6-\n\nVI/80 and No.SOIII(S&GAD)POL-6-IV/92 dated 6.3.2013.\n\n2. As far as our directions to the Chief Secretary, which\nrequired him to look into the conduct of Mr. Shabbir Shaikh,\nDIG, presently holding the charge of IGP, as on the day of\nincident when he was holding the charge on behalf of Iqbal\nMehmood, CCPO were complied with except informing the court\nin writing that he has entrusted the inquiry to some other police\nofficers. We may point out that it was the personal obligation of\nthe Chief Secretary to inquire into the conduct of Mr. Shabbir\nSheikh. The information under the garb of the report submitted\nby him is not satisfactory. We therefore direct him once again to\ncomply with our order in letter and spirit and submit the report\n\nwithin 3 days to the Registrar for our perusal in Chambers.\n\n3. No one has entered appearance on behalf of the Secretary\nInterior, Government of Pakistan, to submit report about the\nincident of Abbas Town nor any report has been submitted by\nI.S.I and/or M.I. Process be repeated for calling the reports from\nthe Secretary Interior as well as the Secretary Defence\n\ncommunicating our order dated 06.03.2013 and the instant one\n\nto be transmitted to the D.G. ISI and M.I. enabling them to put\nup the reports in terms of the orders. The aforesaid reports\nshould reach the Registrar within three days from the date of\n\ncommunication of our orders, for our perusal in Chambers.\n\n4. On behalf of I.B. a report has been submitted by Mr.\nGhulam Nabi Memon, Joint Director. Likewise a report has also\nbeen placed on record by Mr. Shahid Hussain Mahesar, S.P.\nSpecial Branch relating to the intelligence information. The D.G.\nRangers has also filed a reply/detailed report along with the\nconfidential memorandum. All the three functionaries i.e. I.B.,\nSpecial Branch and the Rangers to the extent of memorandum\nfiled by D.G. claimed confidentiality. Office is directed to seal all\nthe three reports in separate envelopes and keep them in safe\n\ncustody.\n\n5. The Chief Secretary and Home Secretary were confronted\nwith the aforesaid reports. We have reached the conclusion that,\nprima facie, there is no coordination between the forces on\nintelligence sharing and concerted efforts are required to\nmaterialize such information between all these agencies.\nHowever, in order to fix responsibility on any of institution,\nfurther material is awaited for examination without loosing sight\nof the national interest. At this stage all these agencies named\nhereinabove besides ISI, MI and other agencies, responsible to\ngenerate information about the terrorism etc. targeting killing,\n\nand/or unrest in the city, should cooperate and develop effective\n\nsystem so that they may succeed to achieve the object of\n\nensuring protection of life and security of the general public.\n\n6. We have painfully noted that despite of our judgment in\n\nWatan Party v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD 2011 SC 997) no\ndedicated efforts had been made at all to depoliticize the police\nforce and to assign task of controlling law & order and\npreventing commission of terrorism and other crimes by\nappointing/posting honest, dedicated, committed and\nprofessional police officers. In as much as despite of our\nobservations the appointment and posting on contract basis, not\nonly in the police department but in the Secretariat like Home\nSecretary, etc., had been maintained. In this behalf a list has\nalso been produced before us by Mr. Ali Sher Jakhrani, AIG\nLegal. We have handed over copy of the same to the learned\nAdvocate General with direction to him to follow our earlier\nobservation particularly in Paragraph Nos. 31, 32, and 33 in the\n\ncase of Watan Party and another vs. Federation of Pakistan and\n\nothers (PLD 2011 SC 997), relevant paras whereof are\nreproduced herein below.\n\n\"31. It seems that the police primarily being responsible to\nenforce law and order has no intention to deliver. Either\nthey are scared or they are dishonest or absolutely lack\nthe requisite skills. It could be that in the year 1992\noperation clean up was launched against MQM wherein\nstatedly, the police had played an active role, but\nsubsequently, 92 police officers/officials disappeared and\nup till now there is no clue of their whereabouts nor is it\nknown that by whom, and under whose patronage, such\n\npersons were abducted and/or killed. Another reason\n\nappears to be that police force has been highly politicized,\nrecruitments have been made on political considerations.\nIt came to light during hearing of the case that in police\nforce many police officers have been recruited on political\nconsiderations who have managed to occupy such posts\nfor extraneous considerations and senior officers in the\nrank of SSP, SP and DSP etc. have been inducted into the\nforce from other organizations without following any rules\nand even they have not undergone training for the purpose\nof policing.\n\n32. The IGP stated that presently, the total strength of\npolice force is 32524, out of which approximately 12000\nare performing security duties. Including 8000 deployed\nwith VIPs and only 200000personnel of police force were\nleft for the purpose of policing of 18 millions people in\nKarachi. He sated that by means of the Sindh (Repeal of\nthe Police Order, 2002 and Revival of the Police Act, 1861)\nAt, 2011 passed by the Provincial Assembly, the Police\nOrder, 2002 has been repealed in the Sindh Province, as a\nresult of which the Police Act, 1861 has been revived and\nthe IGP is helpless in transferring even a SDP from one\n\nplace to another.\n\n33. The majority of the police force performing duty in\nKarachi comprises brave and devoted officers and men.\nThey risk their lives often targeted by unidentifiable\nenemies enjoying mobility in action. They deserve the\nrespect of the nation. However, as the IGP conceded that\n30-40 percent of police force are non-cooperative either\nfor the reasons that they have secured their appointments\non political considerations or they have associated\nthemselves with different groups including political parties,\nhaving vested interests in the affairs of Karachi, therefore,\nat times it becomes very difficult for him to effectively take\naction against the real culprits. When called upon to\n\nexplain as to how two accused persons involved in case\n\nFIR No.434 of 2011, Police Station Zaman Town, have\nbeen released by the Administrative Judge, ATC, accepting\ntheir plea of alibi, where a concerted attack was launched\nupon police officers/officials who were being transported in\na private bus towards the disturbed areas for controlling\nriots and bringing peace, resulting in death of 6-7\npolicemen, causing injuries to others, the IGP disclosed\nthat the investigating officer has been suspended and the\nthen SHO of the relevant Police Station has already been\nmoved out and disciplinary proceedings are in hand\nagainst him. This categorical statement in respect of only\none incident is sufficient to infer that the statement so\nmade by the IGP carries sufficient weight. If the police\nofficial/officers are not sincere with the victims belonging\nto their own rank and file, what expectation could one\nhave from such force, which, admittedly, stands\npoliticized, for initiating forceful action against the culprits\ninvolved in causing target killing, brutal murders, cutting\nlimbs of human bodies and putting the dead bodies and\ntorsos into bags with a view to terrorizing the society as a\nwhole in general and the inhabitants of Karachi city in\nparticular,. During the period of one month, i.e. from 24\"\nJuly to 24t August 2011, as per information submitted\nbefore the Court about the killing of people of 306 persons\n232 FIRs have been registered mostly against unknown\npersons and on completion of investigation in many cases,\nreports have been submitted declaring the cases for\ndisposal under A class, which according to the relevant\n\nPolice Rules means that the crime is untraceable.\n\n”\n\n7. We have been informed that about 631 cases are pending\nbefore the Anti Terrorism Courts No.1, 2 and 3 of Karachi and at\nthe same time out of the cases, which have been proceeded so\nfar, hundred per-cent acquittal has been recorded and\n\nunfortunately action against not a single Investigating officer has\n\nbeen initiated by the competent authority. The Prosecutor\nGeneral is directed to look into all these cases, wherein acquittal\nhas been recorded and accused has been allowed to go scot-free\nand point out the defects in the investigation and _ initiate\nproceedings against those Investigating officers found\nresponsible for the same forthwith. In future all sincere efforts\nshould be made by all the Investigating officers to collect\nincriminating evidence so the culprits, who are involved in\nputting life and property of the citizens in danger, are brought to\nbook. The ATC, though seems to be burdened with the cases,\nare not fulfilling with the requirements of Section 19(7) of Act\n1997, which mandates that such cases have to be decided within\n7 days, therefore, in view of the deteriorating law and order\nsituation prevailing in Karachi, we direct the Provincial\nGovernment through Home Secretary that they should increase\nthe number of ATC and the Registrar of the High Court is\ndirected to place this order before the learned Chief Justice to\ncooperate with the provincial government, instead of waiting for\nlengthy process of the recruitment of Special Judge of the ATC\non emergent basis, all the Sessions Judges of Karachi be\nconferred the powers of the ATC with direction to them that they\nshould give preference, to dispose of these cases expeditiously,\nin view of deteriorating law and order of Karachi, which are\nrequired to be decided on urgent basis. While adopting this\nprocedure, if need be, the Provincial Government may establish\n15 to 20 A.T.Courts in Karachi along with infrastructure, so that\nthey may decide the cases on day to day basis as required by\n\nAnti Terrorism Act, 1997 and the prosecution if succeeds in\n\nproducing the evidence and conviction is recorded, it would send\nmessage to the like minded person. We know that our courts are\nalready burdened with works but in order to meet with this\nspecial situation this exercise is, if taken for a period of at least\nthree months, good number of ATC cases will be disposed of\nparticularly the cases of accused persons who are involved in the\ncommission of the terrorism. Monitoring judge of the High Court\nand of this Court shall also watch proceedings of the ATC in\nterms of law i.e. Anti Terrorism Act, 1997, and the observations\n\nmade in the case of Sheikh Liaqguat Hussain.\n\n8. We have been informed that the present ATC are housed\nin dilapidated building. On getting such information we have\nobtained a report from the Registrar of High Court of Sindh and\nIncharge Branch Registry of this Court, contents whereof read as\nunder:\n\n\"It is respectfully submitted that in compliance of the\nabove referred direction, the undersigned along with the\nMember Inspection Team of the High Court of Sindh and\nMr. Mohammad Amin Khan, Officer In-charge Supreme\nCourt, Branch Registry Karachi, visited the premises\nwherein, three Anti-Terrorists Courts of Karachi are\nfunctioning. The building is situated on Molvi Tameezuddin\nKhan Road in a Bungalow. The building is found in\ndepleted condition. Inside the compound, the main\nbuilding is situated therein two courts are functioning on\nthe ground floor and one court is functioning on first floor.\nThe apartment of the building allocated for each court\ncomprises three rooms amongst them one is comparatively\nlarger where court room is made while amongst the two\nsmall room, one is allocated for the chamber of the Judge\nand the other is for staff of the Court. We have noticed\nthat the office of the Court Room No.1 is situated in a\n\n9.\n\nroom which was perhaps the kitchen of the Bungalow. The\nCourt Room is so small that only two rows of chairs for\nlawyers could be arranged. It is noticed that at the time of\nthe trial the Accused is hardly at a distance of seven to\n\neight feet from the Presiding officer.\n\n2. It is further respectfully submitted that in compliance\nof the above stated specific directions we have visited the\nenclosure without roof or shade which is being used as\nlockup which apparently a cage and perhaps the same was\nused for keeping animals, but now the same is being used\nfor stay of UTPs for producing them before the Court. The\npresent lockup may be seen in photographs which are\ntaken out by Mobile phone and the same are annexed\nherewith as Annexure-A. The situation of Building from\nthe outside and inside can also be seen in the photographs\ntaken by a Mobile phone and printed out are annexed\n\nherewith as Annexure-B.\n\n3. It is further respectfully submitted that it has been\nobserved that UTPs are produced in the ordinary prisoner\nvans and sometimes the hardened criminal are produced in\nAPC. The photographs of the prisoners van are also taken\nand the same are annexed herewith as Annexure-C,\n\n4. It is further respectfully submitted that the Sindh\nGovernment has provided a space in Secretariat Barricks\nadjacent to the High Court wherein provision for six courts\nare being made by the Buildings Department. In this\nconnection meetings with the high-ups of the Sindh\nGovernment have been held under the chairmanship of\nHon’ble Mr. Justice Sajjad Ali Shah.\n\n5. The requisite report is submitted accordingly.\n\nA perusal of the above report is self explanatory. It is also\n\nnoteworthy that there is no arrangement of lock up inside the\n\n10\n\nATC building for the UTPs and they are confined in a cage, meant\nfor the use of animals, which has no roof. This is violative of\nArticle 14 of the Constitution which gurantees the dignity of\nhuman being. We regret to observe that no one has checked up\nthis position by physically visiting the ATC Courts nor any\nresponsible official has taken pain to see how ATC are working.\nThe Judges are sitting in a place meant for kitchen and/or in the\nsmall rooms to conduct the Court proceedings. Copy of the\nreport be sent to the Chief Secretary with direction to make\nimmediate alternate/adequate arrangements for housing the\ncourts along with lock ups where UTPs have to sit till their cases\nare taken up by the courts.\n\n10. Syed Hashim Raza Zaidi, Commissioner, Karachi appeared\nand filed statement informing the court that compensation to the\nfamilies of deceased and the injured persons, is being paid to\nthem and such process of distributing the cheques has\ncommenced, which is likely to complete during the course of the\nday. We have also asked him as to whether any alternate\narrangement has been made for the residences of the persons\nwho had lost their flats, etc. He stated that in the building\nsituated in the vicinity, 32 flats have been acquired. He is\ndirected to rehabilitate all those persons who were affected as\nduring the hearing we have watched a television program hosted\nby Mr. Hamid Mir, Anchor GEO TV which showed the misries of\nthe victims who had suffered during this incident on 3.3.2013.\nThe DVD which was shown in the court room on the Multimedia,\nis directed to be made part of the record so that we may take\n\nassistance from it, if need be while finally concluding this aspect\n\n11\n\nof the case. Similarly, we have also asked to the Commissioner\nthat he should take steps to provide subsistence allowance to\nthe persons who had lost their business. He had promised to\nlook into this aspect of the case as well. In the meanwhile IGP is\ndirected to constitute an investigating team of honest, dedicated\nand committed officers headed by a senior police office not\nbelow the rank of DIG to thoroughly conduct the investigation of\nthe case. However, investigation team shall be free to co-opt\nprofessional police officers which would extend the help in\nreaching the just and proper conclusion. The investigation shall\nbe concluded as early as possible but not more than the period\nprescribed under the law and challan against the culprits shall be\nsubmitted before the ATC. The ATC seized with the matter shall\nproceed with the cases and decided the same in terms of Section\n19 (7) of the Act and the observations made in the Sheikh\nLiaquat Husain’s case. The IGP shall submit report in respect of\nproposed investigation investigation team within three days to\nthe Registrar for our perusal in Chambers.\n\n11. During the hearing, we have been informed that last night\n14 murders have taken place in Karachi. The IGP is directed to\nplace on record the FIRs registered and ensure that all possible\nefforts shall be made to control the crimes and officer of the rank\nof SSP, DIG should be held responsible, in case the crime is not\ncontrolled in the different areas of the city. In the meanwhile,\nthe observations which have also been made by this court at\ntimes shall be complied with and a comprehensive report shall\n\nbe submitted in this behalf on the next date of hearing.\n\n12\n\n12.

Similarly according to the statement of Mr. Anwar Mansoor Khan, learned ASC for the Provincial Government, service of Mr. Fayyaz Ahmed Leghari, I.G.P. and Mr. Aleem Jafri, D.I.G. have been surrendered to the Federal Government vide notification No.SOIII S GAD POL-6VI/80 and No.SOIII S GAD POL-6-IV/92 dated 6.3.2013. 2. As far as our directions to the Chief Secretary, which required him to look into the conduct of Mr. Shabbir Shaikh, DIG, presently holding the charge of IGP, as on the day of incident when he was holding the charge on behalf of Iqbal Mehmood, CCPO were complied with except informing the court in writing that he has entrusted the inquiry to some other police officers. We may point out that it was the personal obligation of the Chief Secretary to inquire into the conduct of Mr. Shabbir Sheikh. The information under the garb of the report submitted by him is not satisfactory. We therefore direct him once again to comply with our order in letter and spirit and submit the report within 3 days to the Registrar for our perusal in Chambers. 3. No one has entered appearance on behalf of the Secretary Interior, Government of Pakistan, to submit report about the incident of Abbas Town nor any report has been submitted by I.S.I and/or M.I. Process be repeated for calling the reports from the Secretary Interior as well as the Secretary Defence communicating our order dated 06.03.2013 and the instant one to be transmitted to the D.G. ISI and M.I. enabling them to put up the reports in terms of the orders. The aforesaid reports should reach the Registrar within three days from the date of communication of our orders, for our perusal in Chambers. 4. On behalf of I.B. a report has been submitted by Mr. Ghulam Nabi Memon, Joint Director. Likewise a report has also been placed on record by Mr. Shahid Hussain Mahesar, S.P. Special Branch relating to the intelligence information. The D.G. Rangers has also filed a reply/detailed report along with the confidential memorandum. All the three functionaries i.e. I.B., Special Branch and the Rangers to the extent of memorandum filed by D.G. claimed confidentiality. Office is directed to seal all the three reports in separate envelopes and keep them in safe custody. 5. The Chief Secretary and Home Secretary were confronted with the aforesaid reports. We have reached the conclusion that, prima facie, there is no coordination between the forces on intelligence sharing and concerted efforts are required to materialize such information between all these agencies. However, in order to fix responsibility on any of institution, further material is awaited for examination without loosing sight of the national interest. At this stage all these agencies named hereinabove besides ISI, MI and other agencies, responsible to generate information about the terrorism etc. targeting killing, and/or unrest in the city, should cooperate and develop effective system so that they may succeed to achieve the object of ensuring protection of life and security of the general public. 6. We have painfully noted that despite of our judgment in Watan Party v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 2011 SC 997 no dedicated efforts had been made at all to depoliticize the police force and to assign task of controlling law order and preventing commission of terrorism and other crimes by appointing/posting honest, dedicated, committed and professional police officers. In as much as despite of our observations the appointment and posting on contract basis, not only in the police department but in the Secretariat like Home Secretary, etc., had been maintained. In this behalf a list has also been produced before us by Mr. Ali Sher Jakhrani, AIG Legal. We have handed over copy of the same to the learned Advocate General with direction to him to follow our earlier observation particularly in Paragraph Nos. 31, 32, and 33 in the case of Watan Party and another vs. Federation of Pakistan and others PLD 2011 SC 997 , relevant paras whereof are reproduced herein below. 31. It seems that the police primarily being responsible to enforce law and order has no intention to deliver. Either they are scared or they are dishonest or absolutely lack the requisite skills. It could be that in the year 1992 operation clean up was launched against MQM wherein statedly, the police had played an active role, but subsequently, 92 police officers/officials disappeared and up till now there is no clue of their whereabouts nor is it known that by whom, and under whose patronage, such persons were abducted and/or killed. Another reason appears to be that police force has been highly politicized, recruitments have been made on political considerations. It came to light during hearing of the case that in police force many police officers have been recruited on political considerations who have managed to occupy such posts for extraneous considerations and senior officers in the rank of SSP, SP and DSP etc. have been inducted into the force from other organizations without following any rules and even they have not undergone training for the purpose of policing. 32. The IGP stated that presently, the total strength of police force is 32524, out of which approximately 12000 are performing security duties. Including 8000 deployed with VIPs and only 200000personnel of police force were left for the purpose of policing of 18 millions people in Karachi. He sated that by means of the Sindh Repeal of the Police Order, 2002 and Revival of the Police Act, 1861 At, 2011 passed by the Provincial Assembly, the Police Order, 2002 has been repealed in the Sindh Province, as a result of which the Police Act, 1861 has been revived and the IGP is helpless in transferring even a SDP from one place to another. 33. The majority of the police force performing duty in Karachi comprises brave and devoted officers and men. They risk their lives often targeted by unidentifiable enemies enjoying mobility in action. They deserve the respect of the nation. However, as the IGP conceded that 30-40 percent of police force are non-cooperative either for the reasons that they have secured their appointments on political considerations or they have associated themselves with different groups including political parties, having vested interests in the affairs of Karachi, therefore, at times it becomes very difficult for him to effectively take action against the real culprits. When called upon to explain as to how two accused persons involved in case FIR No.434 of 2011, Police Station Zaman Town, have been released by the Administrative Judge, ATC, accepting their plea of alibi, where a concerted attack was launched upon police officers/officials who were being transported in a private bus towards the disturbed areas for controlling riots and bringing peace, resulting in death of 6-7 policemen, causing injuries to others, the IGP disclosed that the investigating officer has been suspended and the then SHO of the relevant Police Station has already been moved out and disciplinary proceedings are in hand against him. This categorical statement in respect of only one incident is sufficient to infer that the statement so made by the IGP carries sufficient weight. If the police official/officers are not sincere with the victims belonging to their own rank and file, what expectation could one have from such force, which, admittedly, stands politicized, for initiating forceful action against the culprits involved in causing target killing, brutal murders, cutting limbs of human bodies and putting the dead bodies and torsos into bags with a view to terrorizing the society as a whole in general and the inhabitants of Karachi city in particular,. During the period of one month, i.e. from 24 July to 24t August 2011, as per information submitted before the Court about the killing of people of 306 persons 232 FIRs have been registered mostly against unknown persons and on completion of investigation in many cases, reports have been submitted declaring the cases for disposal under A class, which according to the relevant Police Rules means that the crime is untraceable. 7. We have been informed that about 631 cases are pending before the Anti Terrorism Courts No.1, 2 and 3 of Karachi and at the same time out of the cases, which have been proceeded so far, hundred per-cent acquittal has been recorded and unfortunately action against not a single Investigating officer has been initiated by the competent authority. The Prosecutor General is directed to look into all these cases, wherein acquittal has been recorded and accused has been allowed to go scot-free and point out the defects in the investigation and initiate proceedings against those Investigating officers found responsible for the same forthwith. In future all sincere efforts should be made by all the Investigating officers to collect incriminating evidence so the culprits, who are involved in putting life and property of the citizens in danger, are brought to book. The ATC, though seems to be burdened with the cases, are not fulfilling with the requirements of Section 19 7 of Act 1997, which mandates that such cases have to be decided within 7 days, therefore, in view of the deteriorating law and order situation prevailing in Karachi, we direct the Provincial Government through Home Secretary that they should increase the number of ATC and the Registrar of the High Court is directed to place this order before the learned Chief Justice to cooperate with the provincial government, instead of waiting for lengthy process of the recruitment of Special Judge of the ATC on emergent basis, all the Sessions Judges of Karachi be conferred the powers of the ATC with direction to them that they should give preference, to dispose of these cases expeditiously, in view of deteriorating law and order of Karachi, which are required to be decided on urgent basis. While adopting this procedure, if need be, the Provincial Government may establish 15 to 20 A.T.Courts in Karachi along with infrastructure, so that they may decide the cases on day to day basis as required by Anti Terrorism Act, 1997 and the prosecution if succeeds in producing the evidence and conviction is recorded, it would send message to the like minded person. We know that our courts are already burdened with works but in order to meet with this special situation this exercise is, if taken for a period of at least three months, good number of ATC cases will be disposed of particularly the cases of accused persons who are involved in the commission of the terrorism. Monitoring judge of the High Court and of this Court shall also watch proceedings of the ATC in terms of law i.e. Anti Terrorism Act, 1997, and the observations made in the case of Sheikh Liaqguat Hussain. 8. We have been informed that the present ATC are housed in dilapidated building. On getting such information we have obtained a report from the Registrar of High Court of Sindh and Incharge Branch Registry of this Court, contents whereof read as under: It is respectfully submitted that in compliance of the above referred direction, the undersigned along with the Member Inspection Team of the High Court of Sindh and Mr. Mohammad Amin Khan, Officer In-charge Supreme Court, Branch Registry Karachi, visited the premises wherein, three Anti-Terrorists Courts of Karachi are functioning. The building is situated on Molvi Tameezuddin Khan Road in a Bungalow. The building is found in depleted condition. Inside the compound, the main building is situated therein two courts are functioning on the ground floor and one court is functioning on first floor. The apartment of the building allocated for each court comprises three rooms amongst them one is comparatively larger where court room is made while amongst the two small room, one is allocated for the chamber of the Judge and the other is for staff of the Court. We have noticed that the office of the Court Room No.1 is situated in a 9. room which was perhaps the kitchen of the Bungalow. The Court Room is so small that only two rows of chairs for lawyers could be arranged. It is noticed that at the time of the trial the Accused is hardly at a distance of seven to eight feet from the Presiding officer. 2. It is further respectfully submitted that in compliance of the above stated specific directions we have visited the enclosure without roof or shade which is being used as lockup which apparently a cage and perhaps the same was used for keeping animals, but now the same is being used for stay of UTPs for producing them before the Court. The present lockup may be seen in photographs which are taken out by Mobile phone and the same are annexed herewith as Annexure-A. The situation of Building from the outside and inside can also be seen in the photographs taken by a Mobile phone and printed out are annexed herewith as Annexure-B. 3. It is further respectfully submitted that it has been observed that UTPs are produced in the ordinary prisoner vans and sometimes the hardened criminal are produced in APC. The photographs of the prisoners van are also taken and the same are annexed herewith as Annexure-C, 4. It is further respectfully submitted that the Sindh Government has provided a space in Secretariat Barricks adjacent to the High Court wherein provision for six courts are being made by the Buildings Department. In this connection meetings with the high-ups of the Sindh Government have been held under the chairmanship of Hon ble Mr. Justice Sajjad Ali Shah. 5. The requisite report is submitted accordingly. A perusal of the above report is self explanatory. It is also noteworthy that there is no arrangement of lock up inside the 10 ATC building for the UTPs and they are confined in a cage, meant for the use of animals, which has no roof. This is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution which gurantees the dignity of human being. We regret to observe that no one has checked up this position by physically visiting the ATC Courts nor any responsible official has taken pain to see how ATC are working. The Judges are sitting in a place meant for kitchen and/or in the small rooms to conduct the Court proceedings. Copy of the report be sent to the Chief Secretary with direction to make immediate alternate/adequate arrangements for housing the courts along with lock ups where UTPs have to sit till their cases are taken up by the courts. 10. Syed Hashim Raza Zaidi, Commissioner, Karachi appeared and filed statement informing the court that compensation to the families of deceased and the injured persons, is being paid to them and such process of distributing the cheques has commenced, which is likely to complete during the course of the day. We have also asked him as to whether any alternate arrangement has been made for the residences of the persons who had lost their flats, etc. He stated that in the building situated in the vicinity, 32 flats have been acquired. He is directed to rehabilitate all those persons who were affected as during the hearing we have watched a television program hosted by Mr. Hamid Mir, Anchor GEO TV which showed the misries of the victims who had suffered during this incident on 3.3.2013. The DVD which was shown in the court room on the Multimedia, is directed to be made part of the record so that we may take assistance from it, if need be while finally concluding this aspect 11 of the case. Similarly, we have also asked to the Commissioner that he should take steps to provide subsistence allowance to the persons who had lost their business. He had promised to look into this aspect of the case as well. In the meanwhile IGP is directed to constitute an investigating team of honest, dedicated and committed officers headed by a senior police office not below the rank of DIG to thoroughly conduct the investigation of the case. However, investigation team shall be free to co-opt professional police officers which would extend the help in reaching the just and proper conclusion. The investigation shall be concluded as early as possible but not more than the period prescribed under the law and challan against the culprits shall be submitted before the ATC. The ATC seized with the matter shall proceed with the cases and decided the same in terms of Section 19 7 of the Act and the observations made in the Sheikh Liaquat Husain s case. The IGP shall submit report in respect of proposed investigation investigation team within three days to the Registrar for our perusal in Chambers. 11. During the hearing, we have been informed that last night 14 murders have taken place in Karachi. The IGP is directed to place on record the FIRs registered and ensure that all possible efforts shall be made to control the crimes and officer of the rank of SSP, DIG should be held responsible, in case the crime is not controlled in the different areas of the city. In the meanwhile, the observations which have also been made by this court at times shall be complied with and a comprehensive report shall be submitted in this behalf on the next date of hearing. 12 12. Let this case be fixed for 21.03.2013 and this interim order shall be communicated to all the concerned forthwith over fax and mail. CHIEF JUSTICE JUDGE JUDGE JUDGE Karachi, the O8th March, 2013.

In Karachi Ad eS OUT gayd Jere SST eT pl ab", "Sentences": ["ORDER IFTIKHAR MUHAMMAD CHAUDHRY, CJ.- In pursuance of order dated 06.03.2013 vide notification dated 6.3.2013 M/s Anwar Ahmed Khan, SSP, Qamar Ahmed Sheikh, SDPO, Ali Azhar Iqbal,SI have been suspended in view of the observations, which have been made therein.", "Similarly according to the statement of Mr. Anwar Mansoor Khan, learned ASC for the Provincial Government, service of Mr. Fayyaz Ahmed Leghari, I.G.P.", "have been surrendered to the Federal Government vide notification No.SOIII S GAD POL-6VI/80 and No.SOIII S GAD POL-6-IV/92 dated 6.3.2013.", "As far as our directions to the Chief Secretary, which required him to look into the conduct of Mr. Shabbir Shaikh, DIG, presently holding the charge of IGP, as on the day of incident when he was holding the charge on behalf of Iqbal Mehmood, CCPO were complied with except informing the court in writing that he has entrusted the inquiry to some other police officers.", "We may point out that it was the personal obligation of the Chief Secretary to inquire into the conduct of Mr. Shabbir Sheikh.", "The information under the garb of the report submitted by him is not satisfactory.", "We therefore direct him once again to comply with our order in letter and spirit and submit the report within 3 days to the Registrar for our perusal in Chambers.", "No one has entered appearance on behalf of the Secretary Interior, Government of Pakistan, to submit report about the incident of Abbas Town nor any report has been submitted by I.S.I and/or M.I.", "Process be repeated for calling the reports from the Secretary Interior as well as the Secretary Defence communicating our order dated 06.03.2013 and the instant one to be transmitted to the D.G.", "enabling them to put up the reports in terms of the orders.", "The aforesaid reports should reach the Registrar within three days from the date of communication of our orders, for our perusal in Chambers.", "a report has been submitted by Mr. Ghulam Nabi Memon, Joint Director.", "Likewise a report has also been placed on record by Mr. Shahid Hussain Mahesar, S.P.", "Special Branch relating to the intelligence information.", "Rangers has also filed a reply/detailed report along with the confidential memorandum.", "I.B., Special Branch and the Rangers to the extent of memorandum filed by D.G.", "Office is directed to seal all the three reports in separate envelopes and keep them in safe custody.", "The Chief Secretary and Home Secretary were confronted with the aforesaid reports.", "We have reached the conclusion that, prima facie, there is no coordination between the forces on intelligence sharing and concerted efforts are required to materialize such information between all these agencies.", "However, in order to fix responsibility on any of institution, further material is awaited for examination without loosing sight of the national interest.", "At this stage all these agencies named hereinabove besides ISI, MI and other agencies, responsible to generate information about the terrorism etc.", "targeting killing, and/or unrest in the city, should cooperate and develop effective system so that they may succeed to achieve the object of ensuring protection of life and security of the general public.", "We have painfully noted that despite of our judgment in Watan Party v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 2011 SC 997 no dedicated efforts had been made at all to depoliticize the police force and to assign task of controlling law order and preventing commission of terrorism and other crimes by appointing/posting honest, dedicated, committed and professional police officers.", "In as much as despite of our observations the appointment and posting on contract basis, not only in the police department but in the Secretariat like Home Secretary, etc., had been maintained.", "In this behalf a list has also been produced before us by Mr. Ali Sher Jakhrani, AIG Legal.", "We have handed over copy of the same to the learned Advocate General with direction to him to follow our earlier observation particularly in Paragraph Nos.", "31, 32, and 33 in the case of Watan Party and another vs. Federation of Pakistan and others PLD 2011 SC 997 , relevant paras whereof are reproduced herein below.", "It seems that the police primarily being responsible to enforce law and order has no intention to deliver.", "Either they are scared or they are dishonest or absolutely lack the requisite skills.", "It could be that in the year 1992 operation clean up was launched against MQM wherein statedly, the police had played an active role, but subsequently, 92 police officers/officials disappeared and up till now there is no clue of their whereabouts nor is it known that by whom, and under whose patronage, such persons were abducted and/or killed.", "Another reason appears to be that police force has been highly politicized, recruitments have been made on political considerations.", "It came to light during hearing of the case that in police force many police officers have been recruited on political considerations who have managed to occupy such posts for extraneous considerations and senior officers in the rank of SSP, SP and DSP etc.", "have been inducted into the force from other organizations without following any rules and even they have not undergone training for the purpose of policing.", "The IGP stated that presently, the total strength of police force is 32524, out of which approximately 12000 are performing security duties.", "Including 8000 deployed with VIPs and only 200000personnel of police force were left for the purpose of policing of 18 millions people in Karachi.", "He sated that by means of the Sindh Repeal of the Police Order, 2002 and Revival of the Police Act, 1861 At, 2011 passed by the Provincial Assembly, the Police Order, 2002 has been repealed in the Sindh Province, as a result of which the Police Act, 1861 has been revived and the IGP is helpless in transferring even a SDP from one place to another.", "The majority of the police force performing duty in Karachi comprises brave and devoted officers and men.", "They risk their lives often targeted by unidentifiable enemies enjoying mobility in action.", "They deserve the respect of the nation.", "However, as the IGP conceded that 30-40 percent of police force are non-cooperative either for the reasons that they have secured their appointments on political considerations or they have associated themselves with different groups including political parties, having vested interests in the affairs of Karachi, therefore, at times it becomes very difficult for him to effectively take action against the real culprits.", "When called upon to explain as to how two accused persons involved in case FIR No.434 of 2011, Police Station Zaman Town, have been released by the Administrative Judge, ATC, accepting their plea of alibi, where a concerted attack was launched upon police officers/officials who were being transported in a private bus towards the disturbed areas for controlling riots and bringing peace, resulting in death of 6-7 policemen, causing injuries to others, the IGP disclosed that the investigating officer has been suspended and the then SHO of the relevant Police Station has already been moved out and disciplinary proceedings are in hand against him.", "This categorical statement in respect of only one incident is sufficient to infer that the statement so made by the IGP carries sufficient weight.", "If the police official/officers are not sincere with the victims belonging to their own rank and file, what expectation could one have from such force, which, admittedly, stands politicized, for initiating forceful action against the culprits involved in causing target killing, brutal murders, cutting limbs of human bodies and putting the dead bodies and torsos into bags with a view to terrorizing the society as a whole in general and the inhabitants of Karachi city in particular,.", "During the period of one month, i.e.", "from 24 July to 24t August 2011, as per information submitted before the Court about the killing of people of 306 persons 232 FIRs have been registered mostly against unknown persons and on completion of investigation in many cases, reports have been submitted declaring the cases for disposal under A class, which according to the relevant Police Rules means that the crime is untraceable.", "We have been informed that about 631 cases are pending before the Anti Terrorism Courts No.1, 2 and 3 of Karachi and at the same time out of the cases, which have been proceeded so far, hundred per-cent acquittal has been recorded and unfortunately action against not a single Investigating officer has been initiated by the competent authority.", "The Prosecutor General is directed to look into all these cases, wherein acquittal has been recorded and accused has been allowed to go scot-free and point out the defects in the investigation and initiate proceedings against those Investigating officers found responsible for the same forthwith.", "In future all sincere efforts should be made by all the Investigating officers to collect incriminating evidence so the culprits, who are involved in putting life and property of the citizens in danger, are brought to book.", "The ATC, though seems to be burdened with the cases, are not fulfilling with the requirements of Section 19 7 of Act 1997, which mandates that such cases have to be decided within 7 days, therefore, in view of the deteriorating law and order situation prevailing in Karachi, we direct the Provincial Government through Home Secretary that they should increase the number of ATC and the Registrar of the High Court is directed to place this order before the learned Chief Justice to cooperate with the provincial government, instead of waiting for lengthy process of the recruitment of Special Judge of the ATC on emergent basis, all the Sessions Judges of Karachi be conferred the powers of the ATC with direction to them that they should give preference, to dispose of these cases expeditiously, in view of deteriorating law and order of Karachi, which are required to be decided on urgent basis.", "While adopting this procedure, if need be, the Provincial Government may establish 15 to 20 A.T.Courts in Karachi along with infrastructure, so that they may decide the cases on day to day basis as required by Anti Terrorism Act, 1997 and the prosecution if succeeds in producing the evidence and conviction is recorded, it would send message to the like minded person.", "We know that our courts are already burdened with works but in order to meet with this special situation this exercise is, if taken for a period of at least three months, good number of ATC cases will be disposed of particularly the cases of accused persons who are involved in the commission of the terrorism.", "Monitoring judge of the High Court and of this Court shall also watch proceedings of the ATC in terms of law i.e.", "Anti Terrorism Act, 1997, and the observations made in the case of Sheikh Liaqguat Hussain.", "We have been informed that the present ATC are housed in dilapidated building.", "On getting such information we have obtained a report from the Registrar of High Court of Sindh and Incharge Branch Registry of this Court, contents whereof read as under: It is respectfully submitted that in compliance of the above referred direction, the undersigned along with the Member Inspection Team of the High Court of Sindh and Mr. Mohammad Amin Khan, Officer In-charge Supreme Court, Branch Registry Karachi, visited the premises wherein, three Anti-Terrorists Courts of Karachi are functioning.", "The building is situated on Molvi Tameezuddin Khan Road in a Bungalow.", "The building is found in depleted condition.", "Inside the compound, the main building is situated therein two courts are functioning on the ground floor and one court is functioning on first floor.", "The apartment of the building allocated for each court comprises three rooms amongst them one is comparatively larger where court room is made while amongst the two small room, one is allocated for the chamber of the Judge and the other is for staff of the Court.", "We have noticed that the office of the Court Room No.1 is situated in a 9. room which was perhaps the kitchen of the Bungalow.", "The Court Room is so small that only two rows of chairs for lawyers could be arranged.", "It is noticed that at the time of the trial the Accused is hardly at a distance of seven to eight feet from the Presiding officer.", "It is further respectfully submitted that in compliance of the above stated specific directions we have visited the enclosure without roof or shade which is being used as lockup which apparently a cage and perhaps the same was used for keeping animals, but now the same is being used for stay of UTPs for producing them before the Court.", "The present lockup may be seen in photographs which are taken out by Mobile phone and the same are annexed herewith as Annexure-A.", "The situation of Building from the outside and inside can also be seen in the photographs taken by a Mobile phone and printed out are annexed herewith as Annexure-B.", "It is further respectfully submitted that it has been observed that UTPs are produced in the ordinary prisoner vans and sometimes the hardened criminal are produced in APC.", "The photographs of the prisoners van are also taken and the same are annexed herewith as Annexure-C, 4.", "It is further respectfully submitted that the Sindh Government has provided a space in Secretariat Barricks adjacent to the High Court wherein provision for six courts are being made by the Buildings Department.", "In this connection meetings with the high-ups of the Sindh Government have been held under the chairmanship of Hon ble Mr. Justice Sajjad Ali Shah.", "The requisite report is submitted accordingly.", "A perusal of the above report is self explanatory.", "It is also noteworthy that there is no arrangement of lock up inside the 10 ATC building for the UTPs and they are confined in a cage, meant for the use of animals, which has no roof.", "This is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution which gurantees the dignity of human being.", "We regret to observe that no one has checked up this position by physically visiting the ATC Courts nor any responsible official has taken pain to see how ATC are working.", "The Judges are sitting in a place meant for kitchen and/or in the small rooms to conduct the Court proceedings.", "Copy of the report be sent to the Chief Secretary with direction to make immediate alternate/adequate arrangements for housing the courts along with lock ups where UTPs have to sit till their cases are taken up by the courts.", "Syed Hashim Raza Zaidi, Commissioner, Karachi appeared and filed statement informing the court that compensation to the families of deceased and the injured persons, is being paid to them and such process of distributing the cheques has commenced, which is likely to complete during the course of the day.", "We have also asked him as to whether any alternate arrangement has been made for the residences of the persons who had lost their flats, etc.", "He stated that in the building situated in the vicinity, 32 flats have been acquired.", "He is directed to rehabilitate all those persons who were affected as during the hearing we have watched a television program hosted by Mr. Hamid Mir, Anchor GEO TV which showed the misries of the victims who had suffered during this incident on 3.3.2013.", "The DVD which was shown in the court room on the Multimedia, is directed to be made part of the record so that we may take assistance from it, if need be while finally concluding this aspect 11 of the case.", "Similarly, we have also asked to the Commissioner that he should take steps to provide subsistence allowance to the persons who had lost their business.", "He had promised to look into this aspect of the case as well.", "In the meanwhile IGP is directed to constitute an investigating team of honest, dedicated and committed officers headed by a senior police office not below the rank of DIG to thoroughly conduct the investigation of the case.", "However, investigation team shall be free to co-opt professional police officers which would extend the help in reaching the just and proper conclusion.", "The investigation shall be concluded as early as possible but not more than the period prescribed under the law and challan against the culprits shall be submitted before the ATC.", "The ATC seized with the matter shall proceed with the cases and decided the same in terms of Section 19 7 of the Act and the observations made in the Sheikh Liaquat Husain s case.", "The IGP shall submit report in respect of proposed investigation investigation team within three days to the Registrar for our perusal in Chambers.", "During the hearing, we have been informed that last night 14 murders have taken place in Karachi.", "The IGP is directed to place on record the FIRs registered and ensure that all possible efforts shall be made to control the crimes and officer of the rank of SSP, DIG should be held responsible, in case the crime is not controlled in the different areas of the city.", "In the meanwhile, the observations which have also been made by this court at times shall be complied with and a comprehensive report shall be submitted in this behalf on the next date of hearing.", "Let this case be fixed for 21.03.2013 and this interim order shall be communicated to all the concerned forthwith over fax and

Federation of Pakistan & 2 others\n\n\nCMA No. 64 of 2013 in Const.P.No.87 of 2011 -2-\n\n(PLD 2012 Supreme Court 681). For the sake of convenience,\n\nthe aforesaid Paragraphs are reproduced herein below:-\n\n“40. A bare reading of Article 218(3) makes it clear that the\nElection Commission is charged with the duty to ‘organize’\nand ‘conduct the election'. The language of the Article implies\nthat the Election Commission is responsible not only for\nconducting the election itself, but also for making all\nnecessary arrangements for the said purpose, prior to the\nElection Day. By conferring such responsibility on the\nElection Commission, the Constitution ensures that all\nactivities both prior, on and subsequent to Election Day, that\nare carried out in anticipation thereof, adhere to standards of\nJustness and fairness, are honest, in accordance with law and\nfree from corrupt practices. This Court in Election\nCommission of Pakistan v. Javaid Hashmi and others (PLD\n1989 SC 396), observed that \"(g)enerally speaking election is\na process which starts with the issuance of the election\nprogramme and consists of the various links and stages in\nthat behalf, as for example, filing of nomination papers, their\nscrutiny, the hearing of objections and the holding of actual\npolls. If any of these links is challenged it really (is)\ntantamount to challenging the said process of election\". It\ninterpreted that the phrase 'conduct the election’ as having\n\"wide import\" and including all stages involved in the\nelection process. These observations subject all election\nrelated activities that take place between the commencement\nand the end of the election process to the jurisdiction\nconferred on the Election Commission under Article 218(3).\nThe Election Commission therefore has to test all election\nrelated activities that are carried out in the relevant period,\nboth individually and collectively, against the standards\nenumerated therein.\n\n41. The Election Commission may also exercise its powers in\nanticipation of an ill that may have the effect of rendering the\nelection unfair. In the case titled as In Re: Petition filed by\nSyed Qaim Ali Shah _Jellani (PLD 1991 Jour. 41) the\nElections Commission exercised its powers under Article\n218(3) pre-emptively, by making all necessary arrangements\nto ensure that a certain class of people would be allowed to\nvote. This case implies that where a violation of the standards\nmentioned in Article 218(3) has not as yet taken place, the\nElection Commission is legally empowered under Article\n218(3) to exercise its powers pre-emptively in order to avoid\na violation of these standards. Furthermore, Mst._Qamar\nSultana_v. Public_at Large (1989 MLD 360) and In Re:\nComplaint _of Malpractices_in Constituency No. NA-57,\nSargodha-V (supra) both reinforce the argument that the\nElection Commission is fully empowered by Article 218(3) to\nmake ‘such orders as may in its opinion be necessary for\nensuring that the election is fair, honest etc’. These decisions\n\n\nCMA No. 64 of 2013 in Const.P.No.87 of 2011 -3-\n\n42.\n\n43.\n\n44.\n\nrecognize that the Election Commission enjoys broad powers\nnot only to take pre-emptive action but also to pass any and\nall orders necessary to ensure that the standards of ‘honesty,\njustness and fairness' mentioned in Article 218(3) are met.\n\nThe Parliament has framed different laws to effectuate the\nabove constitutional provision and to regulate elections to the\nNational and Provincial Assemblies. ROPA reiterates and\nfurther vests the Election Commission with the\nresponsibilities and powers to, inter alia, regulate and check\nintra-party affairs and actions taken by candidates and\nparties in anticipation of and on Election Day, resolve all\nelection disputes, declare the election void and to award\npunishments for violating relevant election laws. In\nappreciation of the arduousness of its task, section 5(2) of\nROPA further empowers the Election Commission to \"require\nany person or authority to perform such functions or render\nsuch assistance for the purposes of this Act as...it may direct\".\nThe Election Commission may, under section 103(c) of ROPA\nalso \"issue such instructions and exercise such powers, and\nmake such consequential orders, as may in its opinion, be\nnecessary for ensuring that an election is conducted honestly,\njustly and fairly, and in accordance with the provisions of this\nAct and the rules\". Article 220 of the Constitution also directs\nthe Federal and Provincial machinery to assist the Election\nCommission in fulfilling its constitutional responsibilities.\nThe law, therefore, entrusts the Election Commission with\nexclusive, broad and extensive powers to attend to all issues\nrelated directly and ancillary to the election process.\n\nArticle 218(3) also empowers the Election Commission to\nensure that the election process does not suffer from any\ncorrupt and/or illegal practices. Sections 78, 79, 80, 80-A, 81\nand 83 of ROPA comprehensively define the terms \"corrupt\npractices\" and \"illegal practices\". ROPA in sections 82, 99\nand 100 further elaborates the consequences of such\npractices and enunciate that the same form a sufficient basis\nfor the Election Commission to, inter alia, imprison, fine and\ndisqualify those who violate them. These provisions,\ntherefore, subsume all those impugned activities as\ncognizable by the Election Commission. Similarly, Section\n103(a) of ROPA instructs the Election Commission to ensure\na \"fair election\". In doing so it implies that \"large scale\nmalpractices including coercion, intimidation and pressures,\nprevailing at the election\" would negate the ‘fairness’\nelections are to embody. While sections 78, 79, 80, 80-A, 81\nand 83 specify activities that the Election Commission\ncan regulate and check under Article 218(3), section\n103(a), substantially enhances this defined spectrum of\ncognizable activities and reinforces the obligation to check\nthem. In section 103(c) section it empowers the Election\nCommission to issue instructions, exercise its powers and\nmake orders to effectuate the said standard.\n\nWhile there is no cavil with the proposition that the Election\n\nCMA No. 64 of 2013 in Const.P.No.87 of 2011 -4-\n\nCommission stands as an independent and fully empowered\nconstitutional body, the 18th and 20th Constitutional\nAmendments, have substantially enhanced the degree of\nindependence and the scope of powers enjoyed by the\nElection Commission. Prior to 18th Constitutional\nAmendment, the Commission comprised the Chief Election\nCommissioner and two retired Judges as members thereof.\nVide the 18th Amendment, the strength of the members has\nbeen increased from two to four, with the additional\nrequirement that each of the members be a Judge of High\nCourt of each Province, duly appointed by the President as\nper prescribed procedure provided for appointment of the\nCommissioner in clauses (2)(a) & (b) of Article 218(1) of the\nConstitution. The entrustment of greater responsibility and\nthe enhancement of its strength are part of an effort fully to\nequip the Commission to discharge its broad set of\nresponsibilities. These also reflect a growing trust in the\nCommission to act independently and without influence in\nconducting and organizing elections \"fairly, honestly, justly\nand in accordance with law\". In the parliamentary system of\ngovernment a constitutionally independent and empowered\nElection Commission rests as one of the foundational stones\nof a democratic setup. In the past, the Election Commission\nhas succumbed to external influence and failed to discharge\nits responsibilities successfully. The inadequacy of the\nCommission's effort in organizing and conducting the election\nto the above standards has had detrimental repercussions for\nthe democratic system in Pakistan. Not only has it\nundermined the legitimacy of the elections and the claim of\nthe winning party to form government, but has also, by\ndisregarding express constitutional dictates regulating the\nsame, devastated the trust and faith reposed by the citizenry\nin the rule of law and supremacy of the Constitution. This is\nwhy Pakistan has witnessed political parties, individual\ncandidates, as well as the citizenry, reject and denounce some\nof the election results. The rigging of elections was cited as a\nmajor ground for the imposition of martial law in the country\nin 1977, which was unfortunately validated by the Supreme\nCourt. Consequently, an unconstitutional order was imposed\non the people of Pakistan with the false hope of holding fair\nand free elections within 90 days. The solemn commitment\nmade by General Ziaul Hag, Chief Martial Law\nAdministrator, however, was never honoured and the people\nof Pakistan remained subject to an unconstitutional regime\nfor nearly 11 years. In light of the powers and independence\nthat the Election Commission enjoys today, such an\nunfortunate abuse of power and disregard of the\nconstitutional dictate to establish and preserve democracy\nseems impossible”.\n\n2. We have pointed out to the learned Deputy Attorney\n\nGeneral that as this Judgment was announced by this Court on\n\nCMA No. 64 of 2013 in Const.P.No.87 of 2011 -5-\n08.06.2012, wherein different Articles of the Constitution have\nbeen interpreted, particularly, Article 218 (3), crux whereof is\navailable in different paras, particularly, reference of which has\nbeen made hereinabove, therefore, there should not be any\ntechnical problem to overcome any of the difficulties, if faced by\nthe Election Commission of Pakistan, in organizing, conducting\nand making arrangements as are necessary to ensure that the\nElections are conducted honestly, justly, fairly and in accordance\nwith law and that corrupt practices are guarded against.\n\n3.

Federation of Pakistan 2 others CMA No. 64 of 2013 in Const.P.No.87 of 2011 -2PLD 2012 Supreme Court 681 . For the sake of convenience, the aforesaid Paragraphs are reproduced herein below:- 40. A bare reading of Article 218 3 makes it clear that the Election Commission is charged with the duty to organize and conduct the election . The language of the Article implies that the Election Commission is responsible not only for conducting the election itself, but also for making all necessary arrangements for the said purpose, prior to the Election Day. By conferring such responsibility on the Election Commission, the Constitution ensures that all activities both prior, on and subsequent to Election Day, that are carried out in anticipation thereof, adhere to standards of Justness and fairness, are honest, in accordance with law and free from corrupt practices. This Court in Election Commission of Pakistan v. Javaid Hashmi and others PLD 1989 SC 396 , observed that g enerally speaking election is a process which starts with the issuance of the election programme and consists of the various links and stages in that behalf, as for example, filing of nomination papers, their scrutiny, the hearing of objections and the holding of actual polls. If any of these links is challenged it really is tantamount to challenging the said process of election . It interpreted that the phrase conduct the election as having wide import and including all stages involved in the election process. These observations subject all election related activities that take place between the commencement and the end of the election process to the jurisdiction conferred on the Election Commission under Article 218 3 . The Election Commission therefore has to test all election related activities that are carried out in the relevant period, both individually and collectively, against the standards enumerated therein. 41. The Election Commission may also exercise its powers in anticipation of an ill that may have the effect of rendering the election unfair. In the case titled as In Re: Petition filed by Syed Qaim Ali Shah Jellani PLD 1991 Jour. 41 the Elections Commission exercised its powers under Article 218 3 pre-emptively, by making all necessary arrangements to ensure that a certain class of people would be allowed to vote. This case implies that where a violation of the standards mentioned in Article 218 3 has not as yet taken place, the Election Commission is legally empowered under Article 218 3 to exercise its powers pre-emptively in order to avoid a violation of these standards. Furthermore, Mst. Qamar Sultana v. Public at Large 1989 MLD 360 and In Re: Complaint of Malpractices in Constituency No. NA-57, Sargodha-V supra both reinforce the argument that the Election Commission is fully empowered by Article 218 3 to make such orders as may in its opinion be necessary for ensuring that the election is fair, honest etc . These decisions CMA No. 64 of 2013 in Const.P.No.87 of 2011 -342. 43. 44. recognize that the Election Commission enjoys broad powers not only to take pre-emptive action but also to pass any and all orders necessary to ensure that the standards of honesty, justness and fairness mentioned in Article 218 3 are met. The Parliament has framed different laws to effectuate the above constitutional provision and to regulate elections to the National and Provincial Assemblies. ROPA reiterates and further vests the Election Commission with the responsibilities and powers to, inter alia, regulate and check intra-party affairs and actions taken by candidates and parties in anticipation of and on Election Day, resolve all election disputes, declare the election void and to award punishments for violating relevant election laws. In appreciation of the arduousness of its task, section 5 2 of ROPA further empowers the Election Commission to require any person or authority to perform such functions or render such assistance for the purposes of this Act as...it may direct . The Election Commission may, under section 103 c of ROPA also issue such instructions and exercise such powers, and make such consequential orders, as may in its opinion, be necessary for ensuring that an election is conducted honestly, justly and fairly, and in accordance with the provisions of this Act and the rules . Article 220 of the Constitution also directs the Federal and Provincial machinery to assist the Election Commission in fulfilling its constitutional responsibilities. The law, therefore, entrusts the Election Commission with exclusive, broad and extensive powers to attend to all issues related directly and ancillary to the election process. Article 218 3 also empowers the Election Commission to ensure that the election process does not suffer from any corrupt and/or illegal practices. Sections 78, 79, 80, 80-A, 81 and 83 of ROPA comprehensively define the terms corrupt practices and illegal practices . ROPA in sections 82, 99 and 100 further elaborates the consequences of such practices and enunciate that the same form a sufficient basis for the Election Commission to, inter alia, imprison, fine and disqualify those who violate them. These provisions, therefore, subsume all those impugned activities as cognizable by the Election Commission. Similarly, Section 103 a of ROPA instructs the Election Commission to ensure a fair election . In doing so it implies that large scale malpractices including coercion, intimidation and pressures, prevailing at the election would negate the fairness elections are to embody. While sections 78, 79, 80, 80-A, 81 and 83 specify activities that the Election Commission can regulate and check under Article 218 3 , section 103 a , substantially enhances this defined spectrum of cognizable activities and reinforces the obligation to check them. In section 103 c section it empowers the Election Commission to issue instructions, exercise its powers and make orders to effectuate the said standard. While there is no cavil with the proposition that the Election CMA No. 64 of 2013 in Const.P.No.87 of 2011 -4Commission stands as an independent and fully empowered constitutional body, the 18th and 20th Constitutional Amendments, have substantially enhanced the degree of independence and the scope of powers enjoyed by the Election Commission. Prior to 18th Constitutional Amendment, the Commission comprised the Chief Election Commissioner and two retired Judges as members thereof. Vide the 18th Amendment, the strength of the members has been increased from two to four, with the additional requirement that each of the members be a Judge of High Court of each Province, duly appointed by the President as per prescribed procedure provided for appointment of the Commissioner in clauses 2 a b of Article 218 1 of the Constitution. The entrustment of greater responsibility and the enhancement of its strength are part of an effort fully to equip the Commission to discharge its broad set of responsibilities. These also reflect a growing trust in the Commission to act independently and without influence in conducting and organizing elections fairly, honestly, justly and in accordance with law . In the parliamentary system of government a constitutionally independent and empowered Election Commission rests as one of the foundational stones of a democratic setup. In the past, the Election Commission has succumbed to external influence and failed to discharge its responsibilities successfully. The inadequacy of the Commission s effort in organizing and conducting the election to the above standards has had detrimental repercussions for the democratic system in Pakistan. Not only has it undermined the legitimacy of the elections and the claim of the winning party to form government, but has also, by disregarding express constitutional dictates regulating the same, devastated the trust and faith reposed by the citizenry in the rule of law and supremacy of the Constitution. This is why Pakistan has witnessed political parties, individual candidates, as well as the citizenry, reject and denounce some of the election results. The rigging of elections was cited as a major ground for the imposition of martial law in the country in 1977, which was unfortunately validated by the Supreme Court. Consequently, an unconstitutional order was imposed on the people of Pakistan with the false hope of holding fair and free elections within 90 days. The solemn commitment made by General Ziaul Hag, Chief Martial Law Administrator, however, was never honoured and the people of Pakistan remained subject to an unconstitutional regime for nearly 11 years. In light of the powers and independence that the Election Commission enjoys today, such an unfortunate abuse of power and disregard of the constitutional dictate to establish and preserve democracy seems impossible . 2. We have pointed out to the learned Deputy Attorney General that as this Judgment was announced by this Court on CMA No. 64 of 2013 in Const.P.No.87 of 2011 -508.06.2012, wherein different Articles of the Constitution have been interpreted, particularly, Article 218 3 , crux whereof is available in different paras, particularly, reference of which has been made hereinabove, therefore, there should not be any technical problem to overcome any of the difficulties, if faced by the Election Commission of Pakistan, in organizing, conducting and making arrangements as are necessary to ensure that the Elections are conducted honestly, justly, fairly and in accordance with law and that corrupt practices are guarded against. 3. Learned counsel for the Election Commission of Pakistan stated that to implement the Judgment as well as to ensure holding of Elections strictly in accordance with the Article 218 3 of the Constitution, certain amendments have been suggested, details of which he is required to file before us by placing a comparative statement along with the other steps taken to implement the Judgment in view of the observations made therein. 4. The learned DAG may also seek instructions from the concerned quarters with reference to the implementation of Judgment wherein Article 218 3 of the Constitution had also been interpreted by the Court elaborately, therefore, the Executive Authorities in terms of Article 190 of the Constitution should have no hesitation to implement the Judgment and also to enforce the Constitution in letter and spirit CMA No. 64 of 2013 in Const.P.No.87 of 2011 -6read with the interpretation which had been made.

Legal\n\nFor Parliamentary Committee : Mr. Muhammad Latif Qureshi,\nJoint Secy. National Assembly\nDates of hearing : 11 to 13 February, 2013\nJUDGMENT\nIftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, CJ.— It is the will of the\npeople of Pakistan to establish an order wherein the State shall\nexercise its powers and authority through the chosen representatives\nof the people and wherein the principle of democracy, freedom,\nequality, tolerance and social justice, as enunciated by the Islam, shall\n\nbe fully observed and to achieve the principle and provisions set out in\n\nConst.P.5/13 2\n\nthe objective resolution, they have to elect their representatives i.e.\nMembers of the National Assembly and Provincial Assemblies and\nSenate as well as Local Government, through the process/procedure of\nelections to be organized and conducted honestly, justly, fairly and in\naccordance with law, by the Election Commission, constituted under\nthe Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan.\n\n2. This petition has been filed under Article 184(3) of the\nConstitution by the petitioner Dr. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri in his\npersonal capacity as a citizen of Pakistan. Following relief has been\nclaimed in the petition: -\n\n(i) |The appointment of Chief Election Commissioner and\nfour Hon’ble Members of the Election Commission of\nPakistan is not in accordance with the provisions of\nArticle 213 and 218 of the Constitution. Hence, all\nthese appointments are void ab-initio.\n\n(ii) That a direction to respondent No.1 may graciously\nbe issued on an urgent basis to appoint the Chief\nElection Commissioner and all other Members of the\nElection Commission of Pakistan immediately in\naccordance with the procedure laid down in Article\n213(2)(a) and 218(2)(a) and (b) of the Constitution\nof Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, so that the\nforthcoming election may not be delayed on any\npretext and is conducted, fairly, justly and in\n\naccordance with law.\n\n3. The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has to\nconduct/organize elections enabling the people of Pakistan to elect\ntheir representatives by means of a free and fair electoral process. As\nper prevailing constitutional dispensation, vide notification No.\nF.3(13)/2010-Estt-I dated 16.06.2011, issued under Article 218(2)(b)\n\nof the Constitution, four former Judges of the High Courts were\n\nConst.P.5/13 3\n\nappointed as members of ECP by the President of Pakistan. Thereafter,\non the retirement of the then Chief Election Commissioner, incumbent\nChief Election Commissioner was appointed vide notification\nNo.F.5(7)/2011-PA(C) dated 16.07.2012. Admittedly, the Commission,\nafter fully becoming operational, performed the duties envisaged\nunder Article 219 of the Constitution i.e. preparing electoral rolls for\nelections to the National Assembly, the Provincial Assemblies, and\nrevising such rolls annually; organizing and conducting elections to the\nSenate or to fill up casual vacancies in a House or a Provincial\nAssembly; appointing Election Tribunals, etc. and is now ready for\nholding general elections to the National Assembly and the Provincial\nAssemblies as the general elections are due on the completion of their\nfive year terms in the month of March 2013 under Article 55 of the\nConstitution. Instant petition has been filed on 07.02.2013,\nchallenging the appointment of Chief Election Commissioner as well as\nmembers of ECP. As the petitioner had not established his /ocus standi\nto file instant petition, therefore, on 11.02.2013, he was directed to\nfile a concise statement.\n\n4. A Perusal of the concise statement dated 14.2.2013 filed\nvide CMA No. 756/2013 has revealed that he also holds citizenship of\nCanada, which he has acquired under section 24 of the Canadian\nCitizenship Act, 1985 as a consequence whereof, he has shown\nallegiance on oath to the following effect: -\n\n“From this day forward, I pledge my loyalty and allegiance\nto Canada and Her Majesty Elizabeth the Second, Queen of\nCanada. I promise to respect our country’s Rights and\nfreedoms, to uphold our democratic values, to faithfully\nobserve our laws and fulfill my duties and obligations as a\n\nCanadian citizen.”\n\nConst.P.5/13 4\n\n5. Under section 14(1) of the Pakistan Citizenship Act, 1951,\nif any person is a citizen of Pakistan under the provisions of that Act,\nand is at the same time a citizen or national of any other country, he\nshall, unless he makes a declaration according to the laws of that\nother country renouncing his status as citizen or national thereof,\ncease to be a citizen of Pakistan. However, under sub-section (3), the\nsaid provision shall not apply to a person who being, or having at any\ntime been, a citizen of Pakistan, is also the citizen of the United\nKingdom and Colonies or of such other country as the Federal\nGovernment may, by notification in the official Gazette, specify in this\nbehalf.\n\nHowever, for a person with dual citizenship, there is an express\nprohibition that disqualifies him to be elected as Member of Parliament\nunder Article 63(1)(c) of the Constitution, which reads as under: -\n\n“63. Disqualifications for membership of Majlis-e-Shoora\n(Parliament). (1) A person shall be disqualified from being\n\nelected or chosen as, and from being, a member of the\nMajlis-e-Shoora (Parliament), if:-\n\n(c) he ceases to be a citizen of Pakistan, or acquires the\ncitizenship of a foreign State;”\n\nReliance in this behalf is also made on the case of Syed Mehmood\n\nAkhtar Naqvi v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD 2012 SC 1089).\n\n6. Petitioner contended that being a citizen of Pakistan there\nis no bar to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 184(3) of\nthe Constitution. Reliance has been placed on the cases of Benazir\n\nBhutto _v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD 1988 SC 416), Muhammad\n\nSaifullah Khan v. Federation of Pakistan (1989 SCMR 22), Shehla Zia\n\nv. WAPDA (PLD 1994 SC 693), Yasmin Khan v. Election Commission of\n\n\nConst.P.5/13 5\n\nPakistan (1994 SCMR 113), Al-Jehad Trust _v. Federation of Pakistan\n\n(PLD 1996 SC 324), Asad Ali v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD 1998 SC\n\n161), Ardeshir Kowasjee v. Karachi Building Control Authority (1999\n\nSCMR 2883), Wattan Party v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD 2006 SC\n\n697), Sindh High Court Bar Association v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD\n\n2009 SC 879), Bank of Punjab v. Haris Steel Industries (PLD 2010 SC\n\n1109), Al-Jehad Trust v. Lahore High Court (2011 SCMR 1688), Shahid\n\nOrakzai_v. Pakistan (PLD 2011 SC 365) Workers’ Party Pakistan v.\n\nFederation of Pakistan(PLD 2012 SC 681) and Umar Ahmed Ghuman v.\n\nGovernment of Pakistan (PLD 2002 Lahore 521).\n\n7. Learned Attorney General stated as follows: -\n(a) If the case law cited by the petitioner is taken to be\ncorrect, he has /ocus standi in this case.\n(b) The judgment of 31.03.2009 reported as Sindh High Court\n\nBar Association v. Federation (PLD 2009 SC 879), relied\n\nupon by the petitioner is unconstitutional, especially when\nSupreme Court Bar Association has passed a resolution for\nrevisiting it.\n\n(c) Any judgment of the Supreme Court is not important but\nthe provisions of the Constitution are important and as he\nhas been appointed under Article 100 of the Constitution,\ntherefore, as a Constitutional functionary it is his first and\nforemost duty to follow the Constitution and any decision\nof the Court, which runs contrary to the Constitution, he\ncannot subscribe to that.\n\n(d) Articles 189 and 190 of the Constitution will only apply to\nthose judgments, which are within the confines of Article\n\n175(2) of the Constitution.\n\nConst.P.5/13\n\n(e)\n\n(f)\n\n(9)\n\nAs far as the bona fide of the petitioner is concerned, it is\nsomething which is not to be proven but bona fides are to\nbe presumed, unless and until mala fides are attributed.\nAnd this is exactly what the law of evidence says, that\nquestion of good conduct and character is irrelevant unless\nevidence is given of a bad character in which it becomes\nrelevant. In the instant case the question of bona fides\nwould pale into insignificance and would not be relevant\nunless we have evidence that all this has been brought\nwith mala fide intention and Courts have held in a number\nof rulings that mala fides are not only to be stated but they\nare to be proven.\n\nThe petitioner has laid information before this Court and\nthe Court can always take notice of that information\nirrespective of any bona fides and if the Court feels that\nthere is a law point involved which touches upon\nFundamental Rights and is a matter of public importance\nwhich has been brought to the notice of the Court then\nsurely the Court on the basis of such information laid\nbefore it can assume jurisdiction, which it has done in a\nnumber of cases.\n\nThere is no mala fide of the petitioner apparent from the\nrecord. However, this Court has to examine the question of\nlaches that at this point of time the petitioner has\napproached this Court. Why has the petitioner not\n\napproached this Court at an appropriate time?\n\nConst.P.5/13 7\n\n8. Mr. Muhammad Munir Peracha, learned counsel who\nappeared on behalf of the ECP stated that:-\n\n(a) The petition is barred by /aches. Therefore, at this stage,\ndiscretion may not be exercised by granting relief claimed\nby the petitioner.\n\n(b) Petitioner has no /ocus standi to file this petition as neither\na request has been made to enforce any Fundamental\nRight involving question of public importance nor any bona\nfide has been shown to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court\n\nunder Article 184(3) of the Constitution.\n\n9. It is the contention of Mr. Muhammad Munir Piracha,\nlearned ASC that petitioner demanded in his first public address, inter\nalia, that appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner and the\nMembers be set aside for being contrary to constitutional provisions.\nSubsequently, he arranged Long March and a sitting in Islamabad from\n14\" to 17 January, 2013 wherein he had put forward the same\ndemand, among others. Having failed to achieve his object, he has\ninitiated instant petition with the prayer noted above. Therefore, mere\nfiling of petition under Article 184(3) of the Constitution itself would\nnot provide him /ocus standi to seek relief as he has not put forward\nany question of public importance and the enforcement of fundamental\n\nrights. Hence, discretion may not be exercised in his favour.\n\nAt one stage, the learned counsel also stated that the petitioner\nin his first public address after coming to Pakistan raised a slogan,\n\nwv!\n\ngles Gul) - Uad Gul\" (save the State, not politics) and to achieve this\n\nobject, stated that the postponement of elections for a period of two\n\nyears would be in the interests of the State.\n\nConst.P.5/13 8\n\nThe petitioner controverted the stand taken by the learned\ncounsel and presented a transcript of his speech, forcefully stating that\nhe had never demanded postponement of elections for a period of two\nyears.\n\n10. The factual aspect of the case as has been alleged by the\nparties has to be resolved either in view of the pleadings and facts\nwhich have been brought on record or by taking into consideration\ncertain constitutional provisions relating to the completion of five year\nterm of Parliament in the month of March, 2013 in terms of Article 55\nof the Constitution.\n11. It is to be noted that under Article 184(3) of the\nConstitution, the appointment of Chief Election Commissioner and the\nmembers of the ECP have been challenged. Therefore, it would be\nadvantageous to reproduce the text of the provision here:-\n184. Original Jurisdiction of Supreme Court. (1) ... ...\n3) Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 199,\nthe Supreme Court shall, if it considers that a question of\npublic importance with reference to the enforcement of\nany of the Fundamental Rights conferred by Chapter I of\n\nPart II is involved have the power to make an order of the\nnature mentioned in the said Article.\n\nA perusal of above noted sub-Article (3) of Article 184 manifests that\nthere are two conditions, on the availability of which, original\njurisdiction of this Court is to be exercised i.e. question of public\nimportance and enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights,\nsubject to discretion of the Court as the words “if it considers” have\nbeen prefaced.\n\n12. As per the case law which has developed so far, the\njurisdiction of the Court can be invoked individually and collectively by\n\ncitizen(s) who succeed(s) in establishing his/their /ocus standi to\n\nConst.P.5/13 9\n\nachieve the purposes envisaged by the Constitution. In the instant\ncase, the petitioner has relied upon various judgments of this Court to\ndetermine his focus standi but he has lost sight of the fact that\njurisdiction has to be exercised subject to consideration by the Court\nthat a question of public importance with reference to enforcement of\nany of the Fundamental Rights has been raised. Essentially,\nconsideration of the Court remains on the existence of public\nimportance, which is to be interpreted depending upon the particular\nfacts raised before it on a case to case basis. A citizen who invokes the\njurisdiction of the Court is bound to satisfy the Court that he has come\nbefore the Court with bona fide intentions and therefore, he has /ocus\nstandi to seek enforcement of the Fundamental Rights in question. In\nthe cases relied upon by him, this Court exercised jurisdiction where it\nwas established that violation of any one or more Fundamental Rights\nwere involved. It would be appropriate to note that in the case of\n\nBenazir Bhutto v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD 1988 SC 416) this Court\n\nheld that after all, the law is not a closed shop and even in the\nadversarial procedure, it is permissible for the next of kin or friends to\nmove the Court on behalf of a minor or a person under disability, or a\nperson under detention or in restraint. Why not then a person, if he\nwere to act bona fide to activate a Court for the enforcement of the\nFundamental Rights of a group or a class of persons who are unable to\nseek relief from the Court for several reasons. Article 184(3) does not\nsay as to what proceedings should be followed. Whatever its nature\nmay be must be judged in light of the purpose, that is, the\nenforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights. The said Article\nprovides abundant scope for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights of\n\nan individual or a group or a class of persons in the event of their\n\nConst.P.5/13 10\n\ninfraction. However, it would be for the Court to generally lay down\nthe contours in order to regulate the proceedings initiated by a group\nor class actions from case to case. Having regard to the connotation of\nthe words “public importance”, it will be for the Supreme Court to\nconsider each case to determine whether an element of “public\nimportance” is involved in the enforcement of Fundamental Rights\nirrespective of the violation of an individual’s rights or the infractions\nagainst the rights of a group or a class of persons. The Court granted\nrelief on the ground that the petitioner had succeeded to show the\nviolation of his Fundamental Rights provided under Article 17 of the\n\nConstitution. In the case of Muhammad Saifullah Khan v. Federation of\n\nPakistan (1989 SCMR 22), this Court declined to accept the plea of the\npetitioner with regard to unconstitutionality of certain amendments\nmade in the Delimitation of Constituencies Ordinance, 1988 and\nRepresentation of People Ordinance, 1988 and for declaring the\nconstitution of Election Commission to be illegal, on the ground that he\ninvoked the jurisdiction of the Court under Article 184(3) of the\nConstitution without alleging any infringement of his Fundamental\nRights for the enforcement of which he sought to invoke the\n\njurisdiction of the Court. In the case of Shehla Zia v. WAPDA (PLD\n\n1994 SC 693), though the proceedings were initiated on a letter but\nthe relief was granted for the reasons that violation of Article 9 of the\n\nConstitution had been proven. In the case of Yasmin Khan v. Election\n\nCommission of Pakistan (1994 SCMR 113), the petitioners who were\n\npermanent residents of Pakistan but were earning their livelihood\nabroad, sought enrolment as voters in the electoral rolls. In the case\n\nof Al-Jehad Trust_v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD 1996 SC 324), the\n\nappointment of the Chief Justice of Pakistan and other Judges of the\n\nConst.P.5/13 11\n\nsuperior judiciary was challenged for being contrary to the mode\nprescribed in the Constitution for such appointments. It was held that\nthis Court is entitled to take cognizance of a matter which involves a\nquestion of public importance with reference to any of the\nFundamental Rights conferred by Chapter 1 of Part II of the\nConstitution, even suo motu, without requiring any formal petition.\nThe relief was granted as the Court found that the petitioner’s right of\n“access to justice for all” enshrined in Article 25 of the Constitution\n\nwas violated. In the case of Asad Ali v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD\n\n1998 SC 161), relief was granted to the petitioner on the ground that\nthe petitioner had /ocus standi to approach this Court as his right to\nhave free, fair and equal access to an independent and impartial\ntribunal granted under Articles 9 and 25 of the Constitution was\n\nviolated. Proceedings in the case of Ardeshir Cowasjee v. Karachi\n\nBuilding Control Authority (1999 SCMR 2883) were initiated under\n\nArticle 185(3) of the Constitution against the judgment of Lahore High\nCourt and thus not applicable in the instant case. Further, the\npetitioner had succeeded in proving a violation of Article 25 of the\nConstitution as construction of high rise buildings was allowed on an\n\namenity plot in a park. In the case of Wattan Party v. Federation of\n\nPakistan (PLD 2006 SC 697), relief was granted to the petitioners on\nthe ground of violation of Articles 4 and 9 of the Constitution. In the\n\ncase of Sindh High Court Bar Association v. Federation of Pakistan\n\n(PLD 2009 SC 879), the Proclamation of Emergency and issuance of\nPCO of 2007 was challenged. The Court declared the petition to be\nmaintainable on the ground that violation of Fundamental Rights of the\n\npetitioners under Articles 9 and 25 was involved.\n\nConst.P.5/13 12\n\n13. An analysis of the above referred case law shows that in all\nthese cases, the Court was inclined to grant relief where the\npetitioner(s) therein succeeded in establishing the violation of any of\nthe Fundamental Rights conferred by Chapter 1 Part II of the\nConstitution. In the instant case, neither violation of any of the\nFundamental Rights has been listed in the petition nor established\nduring the course of arguments.\n\n14. It is to be noted that the petitioner has acquired the\ncitizenship of Canada and has taken an oath inter alia to pledge his\nloyalty and allegiance to Canada, and as such this disqualifies him\nfrom contesting elections to Parliament, in view of the bar contained in\nArticle 63(1)(c) of the Constitution which has been elaborately\n\ndiscussed in the case of Syed Mehmood Akhtar Naqvi v. Federation of\n\nPakistan (PLD 2012 SC 1089). It is to be noted that after acquiring the\ncitizenship of another country and pledging his loyalty to that country,\nhe has to lose some of his rights including the right to be elected as\nMember of Parliament, even though he does not lose his Pakistani\ncitizenship as well as other rights granted under the Constitution and\nthe law, as a consequence of his dual nationality.\n\n15. Similarly, a person who has acquired dual citizenship can\nclaim his individual rights such as the right to acquire property or\nother private rights and can also sue for the enforcement of such\nrights. This court has been entertaining such petitions in the past.\nReference may be made to Constitution Petition No.15/2007(Amjad\n\nMalik _v. Federation of Pakistan). The said petition was clubbed with\n\nidentical petitions, wherein the action of former President of Pakistan\nagainst one of us (Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, Chief Justice\n\nof Pakistan) was challenged. [Chief Justice of Pakistan Iftikhar\n\n\nConst.P.5/13 13\n\nMuhammad Chaudhry v. President of Pakistan (PLD 2010 SC 61)]. In\n\nthe said case, the petitioner, Amjad Malik introduced himself as a life\nmember of the Supreme Court Bar Association and a_ Solicitor-\nAdvocate of the Supreme Court of England & Wales, member of\nInternational Bar Association and current chair of Association of\nPakistan Lawyers (UK) practicing from his office at 149 Dark Street,\nRochadle, OL 11 IEF (UK). He made the following prayer:-\n\n“The leave to move a petition may graciously be granted\nas it involves a question of public importance as well as\ninterpretation of Article of which the whole nation is\nconcerned, and a larger is formed as Respondents have\nshown blatant disregard to the rule of law, and norms of\nConstitution and petitioner believes and disputes there is\nno term as such as ‘non functional’ Chief Justice of\nPakistan as it is only the Honourable Office of the Chief\nJustice which upholds the supremacy of the Constitution,\nthe custodian and guardian of justice & rule of law and the\nsooner larger bench settles the actual interpretation of\nArticle 209 and relevant proposition the better it is to avoid\nany further media trial of the sitting Chief Justice as well\nas future media trial of the sitting Chief Justice as well as\nfuture Chief Justice(s) of Pakistan.\n\nPetitioner fears that filing a reference under Art.209 may\nbe used as ploy with mala fide intentions to remove a pro\nactive Chief Justice in future if the law is not settled now\nand may create serius legal questions for the\nindependence of judiciary and safety of the work and well\nbeing of the judges of the Superior Court.\n\nIt is also prayed that direction may be issued to\nRespondent to remove all restraints on the Chief Justice,\nallow him and his family move freely, access to Chief\nJustice to Court and restore his protocol and privileges\nbefitting to his office until reference and or the question of\nlaw is settled by this superior court and may be permitted\nto perform his functions in Court as Chief Justice of\nPakistan.\n\n16. It is abundantly clear that for a person to activise the\njurisdiction of this Court as a public interest litigant, for the\nenforcement of the Fundamental Rights of a group or a class of\npersons, he must show on the given facts that he is acting bona fide.\n\nHowever, it would be for this Court to decide, on the given facts\n\nConst.P.5/13 14\n\nwhether he is acting bona fide or not and whether the petition is\nsuffering from laches or not.\n\n17. It is a settled principle of law that mala fides are to be\npleaded and proven by the persons so pleading whereas bona fides are\nalways to be apparent or should be shown from the record. It is also\nsettled that the superior Courts exercise discretionary jurisdiction\nconferred under Articles 184(3) of the Constitution where the\npetitioner succeeds in establishing his bona fides from the record.\n\nReference may be made to the cases of Shahid Hussain Qureshi v.\n\nManager SBFC (2001 YLR 454). Similarly, in the case of Wagar Haider\n\nButt v. Judge Family Court (2009 SCMR 1243) this Court has held that\n\nconstitutional jurisdiction is always discretionary in nature and he who\nseeks equity must come with clean hands.\n\n18. It may also be noted that the expression ‘bona fide’, for\nthe purpose of invoking jurisdiction of this Court under Article 184(3)\nof the Constitution, has to be applied in contradistinction to the\nexpression ‘mala fide’. Because mala fides, if alleged against any\nperson, is to be proven by bringing admissible evidence on record, as\n\nit has been held in the case of Government of West Pakistan v. Begum\n\nAgha Abdul Karim _Shorish Kashmiri (PLD 1969 SC 14), whereas to\n\nprove bona fide, burden is placed upon the person who _ has\napproached the Court and persuaded it to exercise jurisdiction,\nparticularly with reference to the circumstances of the instant case.\nThe expression, ‘bona fide’ has been defined as per dictionary\n\nmeanings as follows: -\n\nCorpus Juris Secundum page 387:\n\nLatin literally, “by or in good faith”. It has been defined as\nmeaning acting honestly without purpose to defraud; good\n\nConst.P.5/13\n\n15\n\nfaith, as distinguished from bad fait; honest; without fraud\nor unfair dealing; also, in a derived sense, real.\n\nChambers 20\" Century Dictionary:\n\n‘In good faith; genuine’. The word ‘genuine’ means\n‘natural: not spurious: pure: sincere’.\n\nLaw Dictionary, Mosley and Whitley:\n\nBona fide means ‘good faith, without fraud or deceit.\n\nStroud’s Judicial Dictionary:\n\n‘Bona fide’. (1) The equivalent of this phrase is\n‘honestly’...\n\nConcise Law Dictionary of Osborn:\n\n‘Bona fide’ - In good faith, honestly, without fraud,\ncollusion or participation in wrong-doing.”\n\nWhile dealing with the question of “bona fides” of a petitioner,\n\nespecially in the case of a person approaching the Court in the name\n\nof Public Interest Litigation, the Indian Supreme Court in the case of\n\nAshok Kumar Pandey v. State of West Bengal (AIR 2004 SC 280) has\n\nheld as under: -\n\n“Public interest litigation is a weapon which has to be used\nwith great care and circumspection and the judiciary has to\nbe extremely careful to see that behind the beautiful veil of\npublic interest an ugly private malice, vested interest\nand/or publicity seeking is not lurking. It is to be used as\nan effective weapon in the armory of law for delivering\nsocial justice to the citizens. The attractive brand name of\npublic interest litigation should not be used for suspicious\nproducts of mischief. It should be aimed at redressal of\ngenuine public wrong or public injury and not publicity\noriented or founded on personal vendetta. As indicated\nabove, Court must be careful to see that a body of persons\nor member of public, who approaches the court is acting\nbona fide and not for personal gain or private motive or\npolitical motivation or other oblique consideration. The\nCourt must not allow its process to be abused for oblique\nconsiderations. Some persons with vested interest indulge\nin the pastime of meddling with judicial process either by\nforce of habit or from improper motives. Often they are\n\n\nConst.P.5/13 16\n\nactuated by a desire to win notoriety or cheap popularity.\nThe petitions of such busy bodies deserve to be thrown out\nby rejection at the threshold, and in appropriate cases with\nexemplary costs.” [Emphasis supplied]\n\nRelying upon the said case, this Court in the case of Dr. Akhtar Hassan\n\nKhan v. Federation of Pakistan (2012 SCMR 455) has held that while\n\nholding that the petitions are maintainable, the Court has to guard\nagainst frivolous petitions as it is a matter of common observation that\nin the garb of Public Interest Litigation, matters are brought before the\nCourt which are neither of public importance nor relatable to\nenforcement of a Fundamental Right or public duty.\n\n19. Applying the above stated principle to the facts of instant\ncase, it is to be observed that this country, after having remained in\nthe clouds of extra-constitutional eras from time to time, as has been\n\ndiscussed in the case of Sindh High Court Bar Association (supra)\n\nfinally succeeded in establishing a democratic order in the country\nthrough the process of elections when General Elections were held on\n18.2.2008. Thereafter, all the unconstitutional actions of the then\nMilitary Regime were declared non est by this Court in the above cited\njudgment, including the appointment of Judges, who violated the\nrestraint order passed by a seven-member Bench of this Court on\n3.11.2007 against the Military Regime and appointment of Judges who\nwere appointed on the recommendations of an unconstitutionally\nappointed Chief Justice, including the incumbent Attorney General of\nPakistan. It is heartening to note that all unconstitutional actions of\nthe Military Regime were also not confirmed by the Parliament, as it is\nmanifest from the 18°\" Constitutional Amendment. Since then, the\ndemocratic system has continued for a period of 5 years, as the\n\nParliament is about to complete its term on or before 18.03.2013, and\n\nConst.P.5/13 17\n\napproximately 80 million registered voters are ready to elect their\nrepresentatives within the coming few months. For that reason, at this\ncritical stage, no one amongst the 180 to 200 million citizens or\nregistered voters has come forward to question the appointment of the\nChief Election Commissioner and Members of the ECP, who were\nappointed vide notifications dated 16.7.2012 and 16.6.2011\nrespectively. At the same time, no objection or reservation has been\nadmittedly shown to such appointments by the 342 incumbent\nMembers of the National Assembly and 104 Members of the Senate as\nwell as 65, 124, 371 and 168 Members of the Provincial Assemblies of\nBalochistan, KPK, Punjab and Sindh respectively. Nor have the\nprospective candidates for the forthcoming Elections raised a question\nof public importance for enforcement of any of their Fundamental\nRights, either in this Court or before any of the Provincial High Courts,\nfor the simple reason that the entire nation is fully ready for the\nforthcoming elections. Further, the ECP has also geared up the process\nof Elections and statistical pre-poll preparations have almost been\ncompleted by taking all necessary steps in accordance with the\nConstitution and law, as well as the recommendations made by this\n\nCourt in the cases of Imran Khan v. Election Commission of Pakistan\n\n(2012 SCMR 448) and Workers’ Party Pakistan _v. Federation of\nPakistan (PLD 2012 SC 681). In such a situation, the appointments to\nthe ECP (both the Chief Election Commissioner and Members of the\nCommission) have been challenged by a person, who though can\nexercise his own right to vote but is disqualified from contesting\nElections in view of the bar contained in Article 63(1)(c) of the\nConstitution, for the relief which has been noted hereinabove. It may\n\nnot be out of context to note that in the speech delivered by the\n\nConst.P.5/13 18\n\npetitioner on 23.12.2012 at Lahore (transcript of which he has\nprovided himself), he insisted upon the invocation of Article 254 of the\nConstitution to delay the elections. Relevant portion thereof is\nreproduced here: -\n\nGil lS 2S Leal sil jue AS 55) lS AS SIS 28 US asl”\n\ndey 8 alls Sy gales! ie le Liga 9S als Gul pail jail S$ Gas\n\n-ux —i» elections 55! interim government ux use 4:\n\nS 2 8 Lala ls os! ol ysl if amy act au lS LAS AS pa GS ol\n\nwithin a particular (3 ails Ua sl jail jail US ails) phe\n\nS$ 53! period and it is not done within that period\n\nthe Sus» bi ES os) si UKs a 4 ul -S period ules pass\n\n«<5 doing of the act or thing shall not be invalid\n18 58 G38 Ctl GS 5! gl GE act 05\n\n2S los SBS CS os) OL CS usl Liles 84: period »5 S)\n\nCS Oail AS US Ue Gs!

It is to be noted that the petitioner, to achieve his declared\nagenda, admittedly led a Long March from Lahore to Islamabad on\n14.01.2013, which was concluded after a bilateral agreement dated\n16.01.2013 signed between him and the coalition Government. In one\nof the clauses whereof it was provided that the parties shall examine\n\nthe dissolution of the ECP. It is not known whether a decision, if any,\n\nConst.P.5/13 19\n\nwas taken officially in this behalf, but it seems that following the above\nevents, instant petition has been filed. If the facts and circumstances\nnoted above are put in juxtaposition, no difficulty is experienced in\nholding that the petitioner lacks bona fides in approaching this Court\nunder Article 184(3) of the Constitution.\n\n21. As the petitioner lacks bona fides, therefore, at one stage\nhe stated that he has instituted instant petition in the nature of quo\nwarranto. We enquired from him as to whether he had any\nobjection(s) to the eligibility or competency of the Chief Election\nCommissioner and the Members of the Election Commission? He\nreplied that he had no such objection against them. Learned Attorney\nGeneral for Pakistan also stated that the petitioner has laid information\nbefore this Court to exercise/issue a writ in the nature of quo\nwarranto. Suffice it to say that in view of the above noted statement of\nthe petitioner about eligibility and competence of Chief Election\nCommissioner and Members a writ of quo warranto cannot be issued.\nFor these reasons the Chief Election Commissioner and Members of the\nECP have not been made party in this petition. Therefore, the cases\nnoted in the petition, being distinguishable, are not attracted. It must\n\nalso be explained that in Sindh High Court Bar Association’s case (ibid)\n\nno writ of quo warranto was issued. The Judges who took oath under\nPCO and Oath of Office (Judges) Order in violation of the order of this\nCourt dated 03.11.2007 were declared to have rendered themselves\nliable to action under and in accordance with the Constitution.\nResultantly, notices for Contempt of Court were issued to them and\nthey subsequently submitted their resignations from such positions\nvoluntarily. Additionally, the appointments of the Judges which were\n\nmade without the requisite consultation of the de jure Chief Justice of\n\nConst.P.5/13 20\n\nPakistan were declared to be unconstitutional, illegal, void ab initio and\nof no legal effect. The judges so removed approached this Court by\nmeans of review petitions which were dismissed by the judgment\n\ndated 13.10.2009 in the case of Justice Khurshid Anwar Bhinder v.\n\nFederation of Pakistan (PLD 2010 SC 483). Thus, clearly moulded relief\n\nof issuing writ of quo warranto reflects on the bona fides of the\npetitioner for these added reasons as well.\n\n22. It is now a settled position in our system of administration\nof justice that relief is not to be denied to the litigants on technical\nconsideration. However, in peculiar circumstances where the Courts,\nowing a duty to preserve and protect the Constitution, consider that on\nthe one hand, the object of a case and the relief sought from the Court\nas under Article 184(3) by one person alone as against public at large.\nThe question of maintainability of proceedings would arise that of\nsuffering from an_ infirmity/hurdle to effect the result of such\nproceedings and cannot be left unnoticed by the Court. A constitutional\nbar of limitation is not applicable to the proceedings under Article 199\nor Article 184 of the Constitution, however, insistence is placed on\ninitiating proceedings promptly and within a reasonable time to avoid\nthe question of laches.\n\n23. The doctrine of laches has been discussed in detail by this\n\nCourt in the case of State Bank of Pakistan v. Imtiaz Ali Khan [2012\n\nPLC (C.S.) 218]. Relevant portion from the judgment is reproduced\n\nhere:-\n\n“30. ww. Laches is a doctrine whereunder a party which\nmay have a right, which was otherwise enforceable, loses\nsuch right to the extent of its enforcement if it is found by\nthe Court of a law that its case is hit by the doctrine of\nlaches/limitation. Right remains with the party but it\ncannot enforce it. The limitation is examined by the\n\nConst.P.5/13\n\n21\n\nLimitation Act or by special laws which have _ inbuilt\nprovisions for seeking relief against any grievance within\nthe time specified under the law and if party aggrieved do\nnot approach the appropriate forum within the stipulated\nperiod/time, the grievance though remains but it cannot be\nredressed because if on one hand there was a right with a\nparty which he could have enforced against the other but\nbecause of principle of limitation/laches, same right then\nvests/accrues in favour of the opposite party.\n\nIt is settled principle of our jurisprudence as well that\ndelay defeats equity and that equity aids the vigilant and\nnot the indolent. In the case of Jawad Mir Muhammadi v.\nHaroon Mirza (PLD 2007 SC 472), a full Bench of this Court\nhas held that lathes per se is not a bar to the\nconstitutional jurisdiction and question of delay in filing\nwould have to be examined with reference to the facts of\neach case; question of delay/lathes in filing constitutional\npetition has to be given serious consideration and unless\na satisfactory and plausible explanation is forthcoming for\ndelay in filing , constitutional petition, the same cannot be\noverlooked or ignored subject to facts and circumstances\nof each case.\n\nIn this very case reference has also been made to words of\nLord Camden L.C. from the judgment of Smith v. Clay\n(1767) 3 Bro. C.C. 639n at 640n wherein it has been\nobserved that “a Court of equity has always refused its aid\nto stale demands, where a party has slept upon his right\nand acquiesced for a great length of time; nothing can\ncall forth this Court into activity, but conscience, good\nfaith, and reasonable diligence, where these are wanting\nthe Court is passive, and does nothing”. Cited judgment\nalso refers to a book titled Snell’s Equity by John Meghee\n13th Edition, wherein at page 35 it has been observed that\n“the doctrine of laches in Courts of equity is not an\narbitrary or a technical doctrine; where it would be\npractically unjust to give a remedy, either because the\nparty has, by his conduct, done that which might fairly be\nregarded as equivalent to a waiver of it, or where by his\nconduct and neglect he has, though perhaps not waiving\nthat remedy, yet put the other party in a situation in\nwhich it would not be reasonable to place him if the\nremedy were afterwards to be asserted in either of these\nlapse of time and delay are most material”.\n\nIn Member (S&R)/ Chief Settlement Commissioner v.\nAshfaque Ali (PLD 2003 SC 132), this Court has held that\n“writ jurisdiction is undoubtedly discretionary and\nextraordinary which may not be invoked by a party who\ndemonstrates a style of slackness and laxity on his part:\nlaw is well-settled that a party guilty of gross negligence\nand laches is not entitled to the equitable relief.”\n\nIn S.A. Jameel v. Secretary to the Govt. of the Punjab\n\nConst.P.5/13\n\n22\n\n(2005 SCMR 126), this Court while addressing the question\nof laches has observed that “there is marked distinction\nbetween delay in filing of a legal proceedings within the\nperiod specified under the provisions of Limitation Act,\n1908 and undue time consumed by a party in filing of\nConstitutional petition, for which no statutory period is\nprescribed under the law; in the former case, delay of -\neach day is to be explained by furnishing sufficient cause\nfor enlargement of time and condonation of delay within\nthe contemplation of section 5 of the Limitation Act\nwhereas in the later case lapse of time or the question of\nlathes has to be examined on equitable principles for the\nreason that the exercise of Constitutional jurisdiction is\nalways discretionary with the Court and the relief so\ngranted is always in the nature of equitable relief in case if\nthe Court finds that the party invoking writ jurisdiction of\nthe High Court is guilty of contumacious lethargy, inaction,\nlaxity or gross negligence in the prosecution or a cause for\nenforcement of a right, the Court would be justified in non-\nsuiting such person on the premise of laches” (emphasis\nprovided). Hon’ble Mr. Justice Rana Bhagwandas (as he\nthen was), also relied upon the following para of Pakistan\nPost Office v. Settlement Commissioner (1987 SCMR\n1119):-\n\n“There is absolutely no justification to equate laches\nwith statutory bar of limitation. While the former\noperates as a bar in equity, the latter operates as a\nlegal bar to the grant of remedy. Thus, in the\nformer, all the dictates of justice and equity and\nbalance of legitimate rights are to be weighed, in the\nlatter, subject to statutory relaxations in this behalf\nnothing is left to the discretion of the Court. It is a\nharsh law. Thus, passage of time per se brings the\nstatute of limitation in operation, but the bar of\nlaches does not deny the grant of right or slice the\nremedy unless the grant of relief in addition to being\ndelayed, must also perpetuate injustice to another\nparty. It is also in this very context that the\ncondonation of delay under section 5 of the\nLimitation Act will be on different harder\nconsiderations than those in a case of laches. For,\nexample, while it is essential to explain and condone\nthe delay of each day vis-a-vis statutory limitation,\nthere is no such strict requirement in cases of\nlaches.”\n\nThe doctrine of laches was also under discussion and dealt\nwith by Privy Council in the judgment reported as John\nObjobo Agbeyegbe, v. Festus Makene Ikomi (PLD 1953 PC\n19) where the Lord Oakseyquoted the following para from\nErlanger v. New Sombrero Phosphate Company (1878 LR 3\nAC at page 1279):-\n\n“In Lindsay Petroleum Company v. Hurd (LR 5 PC\n\nConst.P.5/13 23\n\n239) it is Said:\n\n‘The doctrine of laches in Courts of Equity is not an\narbitrary or a technical doctrine. Where it would be\npractically unjust to give a remedy, either because\nthe party has, by his conduct done that which might\nfairly be regarded as equivalent to a waiver of it, or\nwhere, by his conduct and neglect he has, though\nperhaps not waiving that remedy, yet put the other\nparty in a _ situation in which it would not be\nreasonable to place him if the remedy were\nafterwards to be asserted, in either of these cases\nlapse of time and delay are most material. But in\nevery case if an argument against relief, which\notherwise not amounting to a bar in any statute of\nlimitations, the validity of that defence must be tried\nupon principles substantially equitable Two\ncircumstances always important in such cases are\nthe length of the delay and the nature of the acts\ndone during the interval, which might affect either\nparty and cause a balance of justice or injustice- in\ntaking the one course or the other, so far as relates\nto the remedy.”\n\nIn the instant case doctrine of laches will have double force\nagainst the respondent-employees because in the first\ninstance they could not prove or show the infringement of\nany right as held by us in the T preceding paras\nhereinabove and secondly because they are guilty of\nlaches in approaching the legal forum in for redressal of\ntheir grievance, if at all they had a legal and genuine\ngrievance.”\n\nIn the case of Muhammad Azhar Siddiqui _v. Federation of Pakistan\n\n(PLD 2012 SC 774), this Court has held that the Supreme Court\nretains the discretion to deny petitioners who approach the Court after\nundue delay or with unclean hands and the question as to whether a\nparticular case involves the element of public importance is to be\ndetermined by the Court with reference to the facts and circumstances\n\nof each case. In the case of Dr. Akhtar Hussain Khan v. Federation of\n\nPakistan (2012 SCMR 455) this Court after relying upon the judgment\n\nof the Indian Supreme Court in the case of Air India Ltd. v. Cochin\n\nInternational Airport Ltd. [(2002) 2 SCC 617] has held that in the\n\nevent of some irregularity in the decision making process, the Court\n\nConst.P.5/13 24\n\nmust exercise its discretionary power of judicial review with\ncircumspection and only in furtherance of public interest and not\nmerely for making out a legal point. It should always keep the larger\npublic interest in mind to interfere or not to interfere.\n\n24. As pointed out by Mr. Muhammad Munir Peracha, learned\ncounsel for the Election Commission of Pakistan, the petitioner came to\nPakistan on 21.12.2012 and filed the instant petition on 07.02.2013\nafter almost a period of about two months, when the general elections\nare just around the corner. A number of bye-elections have been held\nunder the supervision of incumbent Chief Election Commissioner and\nthe Members of the Commission. The National Assembly as well as\nProvincial Assemblies are about to complete their Constitutional terms,\nElectoral Rolls by and large have been completed and as such much\nwater has flown under the bridge. In such a situation, the arguments\nraised by the learned counsel for the Election Commission of Pakistan\nas well as the learned Attorney General that the petition is hit by\nlaches, appeal to mind.\n\n25. Laches are vital in the instant case, as noted hereinabove,\nthe Election Commission is functioning from the day of the notification\ndated 6.2.2011 appointing the members, followed by notification dated\n16.07.2012 of the appointment of Chief Election Commissioner. After\nhaving become fully functional, the Commission is headed towards\nholding elections and no one except the petitioner alone, as a voter,\nhas questioned their appointments through the instant petition on\n07.02.2013 which was taken up for hearing on 11.02.2013. Therefore,\narguments of the Attorney General and Mr. Muhammad Munir Piracha,\n\nlearned ASC in this behalf, in view of the discussion above is\n\nConst.P.5/13 25\n\naccordingly accepted that the petition suffers from laches. Thus, it is\nheld that the petition is not maintainable on this score as well.\n\n26. As far as the other pre-requisite under Article 184(3) of\nthe Constitution is concerned, namely, an element of ‘public\nimportance’ enabling this Court to exercise such jurisdiction, the\npetitioner, in addition to proving his bona fides in approaching this\nCourt and seeking relief as has been prayed for by instituting instant\npetition, has to show that a question of public importance is involved\nin the matter and that therefore, Fundamental Rights have to be\nenforced. The expression ‘public importance’ was interpreted in the\n\ncases of Manzoor Elahi v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD 1975 SC 66),\n\nShahida Zaheer Abbasi v. President _of Pakistan (PLD 1996 SC 632),\n\nSyed Zulfigar Mehdi v. Pakistan International Corporation (1998 SCMR\n\n793), wherefrom following principles have been determined: -\n\n(a) The term ‘public’ is invariably employed in contradistinction\nto the terms private or individual and connotes, as an\nadjective, something pertaining to or belonging to the\npeople; relating to a nation, State or community. In other\nwords, it refers to something which is to be shared or\nparticipated in or enjoyed by the public at large, and is\nnot limited or restricted to any particular class of the\ncommunity.\n\n(b) The phrase ‘public purpose’, ‘whatever else it may meet\nmust include a purpose, that is an object or aim, in which\nthe general interest of the community as opposed to the\nparticular interest of individuals is directly and _ vitally\nconcerned’.\n\n(c)  Itis quite clear that whether a particular case involved the\nelement of ‘public importance’ is a question which is first to\nbe determined by this Court with reference to the facts and\ncircumstances of each case.\n\n(d) The public importance should be viewed with reference to\nfreedom and liberties guaranteed under Constitution, their\nprotection and invasion of these Rights in a manner which\nraises a serious question regarding their enforcement\nirrespective of the fact whether such infraction of right,\nfreedom or liberty is alleged by an individual or a group of\nindividuals.\n\nConst.P.5/13\n\n(e)\n\n(f)\n\n(9)\n\n(h)\n\n26\n\nThe issues arising in a case cannot be considered as a\nquestion of public importance if the decision of the issues\naffects only the Rights of an individual or a group of\nindividuals. The issue, in order to assume the character of\npublic importance, must be such that its decision affects\nthe rights and liberties of people at large.\n\nThe objective “public” necessarily implies a thing belonging\nto people at large, the nation, the State or a community as\na whole.\n\nIf a controversy is raised in which only a particular group\nof people is interested and the body of the people as a\nwhole or the entire community has no interest, it cannot\nbe treated as a case of public importance.\n\nIn all systems of law which cherish individual freedom and\nliberty and which provide Constitutional safeguards and\nguarantees in this behalf, any invasion of such freedom in\ncircumstances which raise serious questions regarding the\neffectiveness and availability of those safeguards, must be\nregarded as a matter of great public importance.”\n\nThis Court discussed in the case of Al-Jehad Trust v. Lahore High Court\n\n(2011 SCMR 1688), all the cases wherein the scope of Article 184(3)\n\nwith reference to the jurisdiction of this Court was highlighted, and\n\nheld as under: -\n\n11. We have also examined cases titled Zafar Ali Shah v.\nPervez Musharraf (PLD 2000 SC 869), Qazi Hussain Ahmad\nv. Pervez Musharraf, Chief Executive (PLD 2002 SC 853),\nSabir Shah v. Shad Muhammad Khan (PLD 1995 SC 66),\nWattan Party v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD 2006 SC 697),\nWasim Sajjad v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD 2001 SC\n233), Muhammad Nawaz Sharif v. President of Pakistan\n(PLD 1993 SC 473), Amanullah Khan v. Chairman Medical\nResearch Council (1995 SCMR 202), Zulfiqar Mehdi v.\nPakistan International Airlines Corporation (1998 SCMR\n793), All Pakistan Newspapers Society v. Federation of\nPakistan (PLD 2004 SC 600), State Life Insurance\nEmployees Federation v. Federal Government of Pakistan\n(1994 SCMR 1341), Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif v.\nFederation of Pakistan (PLD 2004 SC 583), Muhammad\nSiddique v. Government of Pakistan (PLD 2005 Supreme\nCourt 1),. Benazir Bhutto v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD\n1988 SC 416), Javed Jabbar and 14 others v. Federation of\nPakistan and others (PLD 2003 Supreme Court 955). “The\nratio of the judgment referred hereinabove is that unless\nthe matter is of public importance relating to the\nenforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights conferred\nby Part II, Chapter 1 of the Constitution (Articles 8 to 28),\nthe jurisdiction of the Court under Article 184(3) of the\n\nConst.P.5/13 27\n\nConstitution, cannot be invoked. The mere importance of\na matter, without enforcement of any fundamental right\nor reference to a fundamental right without any public\nimportance, will not attract the jurisdiction of this Court\nunder Article 184(3) of the Constitution. Consequently, we\nhaving considered the matter in the light of the law laid\ndown by this Court in the judgments referred hereinabove,\nfind that these petitions under Article 184(3) of the\nConstitution are not maintainable and we are not\npersuaded to agree with the assertion that in view of the\nnature of dispute and importance of the matter, the\nCourt may ignore the objection and decide these\npetitions’ on merits. This may be pointed out that in the\nlight of constitutional mandate as contemplated in Article\n184(3) of the Constitution this Court may not entertain a\ndirect petition under Article 184(3) in a matter not\ninvolving the enforcement of any of Fundamental Rights\nmentioned therein. The question raised in the present\npetitions do not as such relate to the Fundamental Rights\nconferred by Part II, Chapter 1 of the Constitution and\nmost of these questions even otherwise are speculative\nand presumptive in nature at this stage. There is clear\ndistinction between Article 199 and Article 184(3) of the\nConstitution and this Court has repeatedly held that in\nthe matters which do not involve enforcement of the\nFundamental Rights of the public at large as envisaged in\nArticle 184 (3) of the Constitution, a direct petition in\noriginal jurisdiction is not entertainable.” (Jamat-e-Islami\nv. Federation of Pakistan PLD 2008 SC 30).\n\n27. As the facts surrounding the instant petition are rather\npeculiar and merit a complete appreciation of the various factors\ninvolved, it is to be noted at the cost of repetition that the petitioner is\na renowned, well reputed and respected religious scholar, jurist and\nprofessor of law. However, as per his own declaration in his petition\nand concise statement submitted before this Court, he is a citizen of\nCanada. He holds the nationality of Canada and carries a Canadian\npassport which he uses to travel the world for his frequent\ninternational engagements. As per his own admission, he only travels\nto Pakistan on his Pakistani passport and is otherwise allowed to enter,\nremain in and treated as a Canadian national throughout the world. As\nalready noted hereinabove, acquisition of nationality of any foreign\n\ncountry is not an impediment by itself in filing a petition under Article\n\nConst.P.5/13 28\n\n184(3) or 199 of the Constitution. However, there are other\ncircumstances surrounding the matter that aggravate the effect of\nseeking relief through the enforcement of Fundamental Rights for all\ncitizens of Pakistan. First and foremost, the petition is geared against\nthe election Commission of Pakistan, an independent institution and\ncreature of the Constitution that ensures the very strength, survival\nand continuity of our democratic system. Given that this is an election\nyear, the importance of the Election Commission is highlighted more\nthan ever and we must be ever more cautious to not even appear to\nbe partaking in placing restrictions upon its independent and\nConstitutional functions. In this regard, this is certainly a matter of\ngreat public concern as it pertains to the deliverance of the right of\nrepresentation through fair and free elections which has been held to\nbe a key aspect of democracy identified by the Constitution in Workers\n\nParty Pakistan v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD 2012 Sc 681). Therefore,\n\nan attack on the constitutional validity of such an important institution\ncannot be well received from the petitioner.\n\n28. From the perusal of the petition it is clear that the\npetitioner primarily has emphasized that the procedure provided in\nArticles 213 and 218 of the Constitution with regard to appointment of\nthe Chief Election Commissioner as well as the Members of ECP has\nnot been followed in letter and spirit. However, neither infraction of\nany of the Fundamental Rights has been listed in the petition nor\nenforcement of the same has been sought in the prayer clause; and\neven during the course of arguments the petitioner has failed to\nidentify any of the Fundamental Rights, which may have been violated.\nDespite insistence of the Court, the petitioner did not show as to which\n\nof the Fundamental Rights had been violated. Thus, one of the\n\nConst.P.5/13 29\n\nfundamental requirements of Article 184(3) of the Constitution,\nnamely, the violation of any of the Fundamental Rights, enabling this\nCourt to exercise jurisdiction conferred by said Article, is apparently\nmissing in the instant case.\n\n29. At this stage, it would be appropriate to consider the scope\nof Article 184(3) of the Constitution as deliberated upon by this Court\n\nin various pronouncements. In the cases of Benazir Bhutto Vv.\n\nFederation of Pakistan (PLD 1988 SC 416), it has been held as under:-\n\n“Article 184(3) of the Constitution empowers Supreme\nCourt to enforce the Fundamental Rights where the\nquestion of public importance arises in relation thereto.\nAnd if looked at from this angle it is hardly of any\nimportance whether the Executive has passed a prejudicial\norder or not when the infraction of the Fundamental Rights\ntakes place by the operation of the law itself. In this\ncontext what would be relevant would be the language of\nthe provisions of the impugned Act itself. It will then not\nbe a question of the Court merely granting a declaration as\nto the validity or invalidity of law in the abstract. An\nenactment may immediately on its coming into force take\naway or abridge the Fundamental Rights of a person by its\nvery terms and without any further overt act being done.\nIn such a case the infringement of the Fundamental Right\nis complete co instant the passing of the enactment and,\ntherefore, there can be no reason why the person so\nprejudicially affected by the law should not be entitled\nimmediately to avail himself of the constitutional remedy.\nTo say that a person, whose fundamental Right has been\ninfringed by the mere operation of an enactment, is not\nentitled to invoke the jurisdiction of Supreme Court for the\nenforcement of his right, will be to deny him the benefit of\na salutary constitutional remedy which is itself his\nFundamental Right. The infractions alleged cannot be\nregarded as seeking a declaration in the air or asking the\nCourt to decide, in abstract, and for that matter\nhypothetical or contingent questions.”\n\nSimilarly, this Court in the case of_Muhammad Nawaz_ Sharif _v.\n\nPresident of Pakistan (PLD 1993 SC 473) has held as under:-\n\nArticle 184(3) of the Constitution of Pakistan pertains to\noriginal jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and its object is\nto ensure the enforcement of Fundamental Rights\nreferred to therein. This provision is an _ edifice of\ndemocratic way,,of life and manifestation of responsibility\ncasts on this Court as a protector and guardian of the\n\nConst.P.5/13 30\n\nConstitution. The jurisdiction conferred by it is fairly wide\nand the Court can make an order of the nature envisaged\nby Article 199, in a case where a question of public\nimportance, with reference to enforcement of any\nfundamental right conferred by Chapter 1 of Part II of the\nConstitution is involved. Article 184(3) is remedial in\ncharacter and is conditioned by three _ prerequisites,\nnamely: -\n\n(i) | There is a question of public importance.\n\n(ii) Such a question involves the enforcement of a\nfundamental right, and\n\n(iii) The fundamental right sought to be enforced is\nconferred by Chapter 1, Part II of the Constitution.”\n\nIn case of Jamat-e-Islami_v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD 2008\n\nSupreme Court 30) following observations have been made:-\n\n31. There are two essential conditions for invoking the\njurisdiction of Supreme Court of Pakistan under Article\n184(3) of the Constitution. The first condition is that\nsubject matter of the petition under this Article must be of\npublic importance and second condition is that it must\nrelate to the enforcement of any of the Fundamental\nRights conferred by Part II, Chapter 1 of the Constitution.\nWe, therefore, in the light of law laid down by this Court\non the subject, would like to examine the question whether\nthe present petitions qualify the above test to entertain the\nsame under Article 184(3) of the Constitution.”\n\nIn the case of Bank of Punjab v. Haris Steel Industries (PLD 2010 SC\n\n1109) relief was granted to the petitioner on the ground that the right\nof property granted under Articles 9 and 24 of the Constitution were\ninvolved, as due to gravest financial scams in the history of Pakistan,\nthe bank stood cheated of an enormous amount of around 11 billions\n\nRupees. In the case of Shahid Orakzai_ v. Pakistan (PLD 2011 SC 365)\n\nthe appointment of the Chairman National Accountability Bureau (NAB)\nwas declared illegal and ultra vires the Constitution and the law on the\nground that Article 5(2) of the Constitution mandated an obligation of\nobedience to the Constitution and law as an inviolable obligation of\n\nevery citizen. In the case of Al-Jehad Trust v. Lahore High Court (2011\n\n\nConst.P.5/13 31\n\nSCMR 1688), a petition was filed under Article 184(3) of the\nConstitution against initiation of disciplinary proceedings against the\nDistrict & Sessions Judge/Special Judge (Central) Rawalpindi by the\nLahore High Court. This Court declined to entertain the petition on the\nground that the jurisdiction, as conferred upon this Court under Article\n184(3) of the Constitution, can be exercised only where a question of\npublic importance with reference to the enforcement of any of the\nFundamental Rights was involved, which was missing in the said case.\n\nIn the case of Workers’ Party Pakistan v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD\n\n2012 SC 681), the petitioner invoked the original jurisdiction of this\nCourt, questioning the contents of a memo published in a newspaper\nas being violative of the Fundamental Rights of the petitioners. The\nCourt declared the petitions to be maintainable for the reasons that\nthe issues involved in the case were justiciable and a question of\npublic importance with reference to Fundamental Rights under Articles\n9, 14 and 19A of the Constitution had been made out.\n\n30. The upshot of the above discussion is that the burden of\nproof was upon the petitioner to demonstrate as to which of his\nfundamental rights had been infringed upon but he failed to point out\nan infraction of any of his fundamental rights. Thus, judgments relied\nupon by the petitioner are not attracted to the facts of the instant\ncase.\n\n31. Before parting with the judgment, it is to be noted with\nregard to the question of extending the right of vote to citizens of\nPakistan living abroad, some of whom may be holding dual citizenship,\nthat as a voter, the petitioner can also exercise his right of vote like\nother overseas Pakistanis whose names have been incorporated in the\n\nElectoral Rolls. This right has been recognized under the Constitution\n\nConst.P.5/13 32\n\nand has also been held by this Court in the case of Yasmin Akhtar v.\n\nElection Commission of Paksitan (1994 SCMR 113), which was finally\ndisposed of vide judgment dated 18.12.1993 in Constitution Petition\nNo.26/1993. Reference in this regard may also be made to the case\n\nCh. Nasir _Igbal_v. Federation of Pakistan (Constitutional Petition\n\nNo.39/2011 etc.), wherein vide order dated 14.02.2013, the ECP was\ndirected to ensure that all the overseas citizens of Pakistan, who are\nqualified/eligible for the registration of their votes in accordance with\nthe Electoral Rolls Act, 1974 and the Rules framed thereunder must be\nregistered before the forthcoming elections.\n\n32. Hereinabove are the reasons of our short order of even\n\ndate, which reads as under:-\n\n“For reasons to be recorded later it is held that petitioner, Dr.\nMuhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri has failed to make out a case for\nexercising the discretionary jurisdiction by this Court under\nArticle 184(3) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of\nPakistan, for the facts that violation of any of the Fundamental\nRights under Chapter 1 of Part II of the Constitution has neither\nbeen listed in the petition nor established during course of\narguments, despite of insistence by the Bench to do so. The\npetitioner has also failed to prove his bona fides in view of the\nfacts, which have been noticed at the hearing of the case, to\ninvoke the jurisdiction of this Court coupled with the fact that\nunder the peculiar circumstances he has no locus standi to claim\nrelief as it has been prayed for in the petition, inter alia, for the\nreasons that being a holder of dual citizenship, he is not\nqualified (disqualified) to contest the election to the Parliament\nin view of the constitutional bar under Article 63(1)(c) of the\nConstitution, which has been interpreted by this Court in the\ncase of Syed Mehmood Akhtar Naqvi v. Federation of Pakistan\n(PLD 2012 SC 1089).\n\n2. However, it is loudly and clearly observed that as a\n\nvoter like other overseas Pakistanis, whose names have been\nincorporated in the Electoral Rolls, he can exercise his right of\n\nvote as this right is recognized under the Constitution and has\n\nConst.P.5/13 33\n\nalso been held by this Court in the case of Yasmin Khan v.\nElection Commission of Pakistan (1994 SCMR 113), which was\nfinally disposed of vide judgment in Constitution Petition\n26/1993 dated 18.12.1993. Thus, the petition is dismissed.\n\n3. Before parting with the short order, it is essential\nto note that at the time of concluding his arguments on the\npoints noted hereinabove, he started making uncalled for\naspersions against the member of the Bench, which are\ntantamount prima facie to undermine its authority calling for\naction against him for Contempt of Court under Article 204(3) of\nthe Constitution read with section 3 of the Contempt of Court\nOrdinance, 2003. However we, while exercising restraint, have\ndecided not to proceed against him following the principle that\nsuch jurisdiction has to be exercised sparingly on case to case\n\nbasis.”\n\nChief Justice\n\nJudge\n\nJudge\n\nIslamabad, the\n13 February, 2013\nNisar/*\n\nAPPROVED FOR REPORTING\n\n\n(orb )\n\nCrP) bun ABI\n(@evik yey\n5 Jevldy % 1162013\neee, KE Soe i 4\nAS eb Sai pb 4-13\na\n\net Bus\n\nah Asrtiptigste gpk\n\nwPolh : Neely’\n\net Jz Lelwh bret ee SAU Binal SIL ae\nbbs otedokl Belts\nLEB hole\n\n1201354713 611: ae Gt\n\nLb VPRO LIM ter Se Bi Cur (ify a te Ae\nCle SUL el Fe Ut pele Lz Uk\nwee Wl on Gl SLI OF bus Solas celles « GIT Ll Sunt GU Le\nFIR ep TU tee Seb but of TAT PL\nGEE a te SPY EV L 4 Sst earch iN€ sk“ byeeusl\nHL I fTSZ PAPE WL yeu Fle 56S coc PLbay\n\nEb tn be le Yo b&\n\nHL Sah pb Fb IS eid FL 184(3) KIL of Tels» 2\n2 Lull 6b Bo Utetvet Sted dugidet\n\nBIE ft bed Sue TA Hur iae (i\n\nLU MeN ee UL Felty We UP AY £218 1213\n\nsh Foi Seb Sob elles LP SIS WIL A A Sy (ii)\nKE 61973 2f wt of al WF Foe St 7 gt\nLU Pek L ite bEL Hs Ut 218(2)(a)(b) 11! 213(2)(a)\n\nSIE Ii sleber SE BK ylules Zt elPle tt\n\n-Exn\nBNL Ie Ue sa KLE Os J ut oT ft Fi\nPEI ot bn HOLES FALL LGC ber ul wT Syhe¥\nSib FL 218(2)(b) KIL ef Tz 16.06.2011 2.F.3(13)/2010-Estt-!\nSete ( babe L ale ede Ltt weFl STOW Lf\n\nBCS av wt L Ble GY GAL os vi uit ot wl BL\neb BW ut 16.07.2012 1F.5(7)/2011-PA(C) Pes A\nOb L219 BIL of Ta £ bn hy HPL Pe ee\n6 We SU FOF eB L Fi bbe SFE SCF tr leone Unb\nSETI, ble 6 CWP E eer ty Gb se Sured ul al 66\nUdi byeut Fo AA Cutt eed OF ete Fi od Sur”\nUE 2013G2FL55 BTL of TeP ire Ole ip ABIL eWIL\nwe eeldy war op bb La LE Se Je GS ek\nWi diez WEE MPS ti YE az tt 2 ES 702.2013\nBPE Shetek OGL Me toerr Ten BU\n\nAK be SLIP ok BIS 11.02.2013\n\nE£ 1756/2013 4 eit OF?

It is the will of the people of Pakistan to establish an order wherein the State shall exercise its powers and authority through the chosen representatives of the people and wherein the principle of democracy, freedom, equality, tolerance and social justice, as enunciated by the Islam, shall be fully observed and to achieve the principle and provisions set out in 2 the objective resolution, they have to elect their representatives i.e. Members of the National Assembly and Provincial Assemblies and Senate as well as Local Government, through the process/procedure of elections to be organized and conducted honestly, justly, fairly and in accordance with law, by the Election Commission, constituted under the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan. 2. This petition has been filed under Article 184 3 of the Constitution by the petitioner Dr. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri in his personal capacity as a citizen of Pakistan. Following relief has been claimed in the petition: - i The appointment of Chief Election Commissioner and four Hon ble Members of the Election Commission of Pakistan is not in accordance with the provisions of Article 213 and 218 of the Constitution. Hence, all these appointments are void ab-initio. ii That a direction to respondent No.1 may graciously be issued on an urgent basis to appoint the Chief Election Commissioner and all other Members of the Election Commission of Pakistan immediately in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 213 2 a and 218 2 a and b of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, so that the forthcoming election may not be delayed on any pretext and is conducted, fairly, justly and in accordance with law. 3. The Election Commission of Pakistan ECP has to conduct/organize elections enabling the people of Pakistan to elect their representatives by means of a free and fair electoral process. As per prevailing constitutional dispensation, vide notification No. F.3 13 /2010-Estt-I dated 16.06.2011, issued under Article 218 2 b of the Constitution, four former Judges of the High Courts were 3 appointed as members of ECP by the President of Pakistan. Thereafter, on the retirement of the then Chief Election Commissioner, incumbent Chief Election Commissioner was appointed vide notification No.F.5 7 /2011-PA C dated 16.07.2012. Admittedly, the Commission, after fully becoming operational, performed the duties envisaged under Article 219 of the Constitution i.e. preparing electoral rolls for elections to the National Assembly, the Provincial Assemblies, and revising such rolls annually; organizing and conducting elections to the Senate or to fill up casual vacancies in a House or a Provincial Assembly; appointing Election Tribunals, etc. and is now ready for holding general elections to the National Assembly and the Provincial Assemblies as the general elections are due on the completion of their five year terms in the month of March 2013 under Article 55 of the Constitution. Instant petition has been filed on 07.02.2013, challenging the appointment of Chief Election Commissioner as well as members of ECP. As the petitioner had not established his /ocus standi to file instant petition, therefore, on 11.02.2013, he was directed to file a concise statement. 4. A Perusal of the concise statement dated 14.2.2013 filed vide CMA No. 756/2013 has revealed that he also holds citizenship of Canada, which he has acquired under section 24 of the Canadian Citizenship Act, 1985 as a consequence whereof, he has shown allegiance on oath to the following effect: - From this day forward, I pledge my loyalty and allegiance to Canada and Her Majesty Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Canada. I promise to respect our country s Rights and freedoms, to uphold our democratic values, to faithfully observe our laws and fulfill my duties and obligations as a Canadian citizen. 4 5. Under section 14 1 of the Pakistan Citizenship Act, 1951, if any person is a citizen of Pakistan under the provisions of that Act, and is at the same time a citizen or national of any other country, he shall, unless he makes a declaration according to the laws of that other country renouncing his status as citizen or national thereof, cease to be a citizen of Pakistan. However, under sub-section 3 , the said provision shall not apply to a person who being, or having at any time been, a citizen of Pakistan, is also the citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies or of such other country as the Federal Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, specify in this behalf. However, for a person with dual citizenship, there is an express prohibition that disqualifies him to be elected as Member of Parliament under Article 63 1 c of the Constitution, which reads as under: - 63. Disqualifications for membership of Majlis-e-Shoora Parliament . 1 A person shall be disqualified from being elected or chosen as, and from being, a member of the Majlis-e-Shoora Parliament , if:- c he ceases to be a citizen of Pakistan, or acquires the citizenship of a foreign State; Reliance in this behalf is also made on the case of Syed Mehmood Akhtar Naqvi v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 2012 SC 1089 . 6. Petitioner contended that being a citizen of Pakistan there is no bar to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 184 3 of the Constitution. Reliance has been placed on the cases of Benazir Bhutto v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 1988 SC 416 , Muhammad Saifullah Khan v. Federation of Pakistan 1989 SCMR 22 , Shehla Zia v. WAPDA PLD 1994 SC 693 , Yasmin Khan v. Election Commission of 5 Pakistan 1994 SCMR 113 , Al-Jehad Trust v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 1996 SC 324 , Asad Ali v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 1998 SC 161 , Ardeshir Kowasjee v. Karachi Building Control Authority 1999 SCMR 2883 , Wattan Party v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 2006 SC 697 , Sindh High Court Bar Association v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 2009 SC 879 , Bank of Punjab v. Haris Steel Industries PLD 2010 SC 1109 , Al-Jehad Trust v. Lahore High Court 2011 SCMR 1688 , Shahid Orakzai v. Pakistan PLD 2011 SC 365 Workers Party Pakistan v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 2012 SC 681 and Umar Ahmed Ghuman v. Government of Pakistan PLD 2002 Lahore 521 . 7. Learned Attorney General stated as follows: - a If the case law cited by the petitioner is taken to be correct, he has /ocus standi in this case. b The judgment of 31.03.2009 reported as Sindh High Court Bar Association v. Federation PLD 2009 SC 879 , relied upon by the petitioner is unconstitutional, especially when Supreme Court Bar Association has passed a resolution for revisiting it. c Any judgment of the Supreme Court is not important but the provisions of the Constitution are important and as he has been appointed under Article 100 of the Constitution, therefore, as a Constitutional functionary it is his first and foremost duty to follow the Constitution and any decision of the Court, which runs contrary to the Constitution, he cannot subscribe to that. d Articles 189 and 190 of the Constitution will only apply to those judgments, which are within the confines of Article 175 2 of the Constitution. e f 9 As far as the bona fide of the petitioner is concerned, it is something which is not to be proven but bona fides are to be presumed, unless and until mala fides are attributed. And this is exactly what the law of evidence says, that question of good conduct and character is irrelevant unless evidence is given of a bad character in which it becomes relevant. In the instant case the question of bona fides would pale into insignificance and would not be relevant unless we have evidence that all this has been brought with mala fide intention and Courts have held in a number of rulings that mala fides are not only to be stated but they are to be proven. The petitioner has laid information before this Court and the Court can always take notice of that information irrespective of any bona fides and if the Court feels that there is a law point involved which touches upon Fundamental Rights and is a matter of public importance which has been brought to the notice of the Court then surely the Court on the basis of such information laid before it can assume jurisdiction, which it has done in a number of cases. There is no mala fide of the petitioner apparent from the record. However, this Court has to examine the question of laches that at this point of time the petitioner has approached this Court. Why has the petitioner not approached this Court at an appropriate time? 7 8. Mr. Muhammad Munir Peracha, learned counsel who appeared on behalf of the ECP stated that:- a The petition is barred by /aches. Therefore, at this stage, discretion may not be exercised by granting relief claimed by the petitioner. b Petitioner has no /ocus standi to file this petition as neither a request has been made to enforce any Fundamental Right involving question of public importance nor any bona fide has been shown to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 184 3 of the Constitution. 9. It is the contention of Mr. Muhammad Munir Piracha, learned ASC that petitioner demanded in his first public address, inter alia, that appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner and the Members be set aside for being contrary to constitutional provisions. Subsequently, he arranged Long March and a sitting in Islamabad from 14 to 17 January, 2013 wherein he had put forward the same demand, among others. Having failed to achieve his object, he has initiated instant petition with the prayer noted above. Therefore, mere filing of petition under Article 184 3 of the Constitution itself would not provide him /ocus standi to seek relief as he has not put forward any question of public importance and the enforcement of fundamental rights. Hence, discretion may not be exercised in his favour. At one stage, the learned counsel also stated that the petitioner in his first public address after coming to Pakistan raised a slogan, wv! gles Gul - Uad Gul save the State, not politics and to achieve this object, stated that the postponement of elections for a period of two years would be in the interests of the State. 8 The petitioner controverted the stand taken by the learned counsel and presented a transcript of his speech, forcefully stating that he had never demanded postponement of elections for a period of two years. 10. The factual aspect of the case as has been alleged by the parties has to be resolved either in view of the pleadings and facts which have been brought on record or by taking into consideration certain constitutional provisions relating to the completion of five year term of Parliament in the month of March, 2013 in terms of Article 55 of the Constitution. 11. It is to be noted that under Article 184 3 of the Constitution, the appointment of Chief Election Commissioner and the members of the ECP have been challenged. Therefore, it would be advantageous to reproduce the text of the provision here:- 184. Original Jurisdiction of Supreme Court. 1 ... ... 3 Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 199, the Supreme Court shall, if it considers that a question of public importance with reference to the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights conferred by Chapter I of Part II is involved have the power to make an order of the nature mentioned in the said Article. A perusal of above noted sub-Article 3 of Article 184 manifests that there are two conditions, on the availability of which, original jurisdiction of this Court is to be exercised i.e. question of public importance and enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights, subject to discretion of the Court as the words if it considers have been prefaced. 12. As per the case law which has developed so far, the jurisdiction of the Court can be invoked individually and collectively by citizen s who succeed s in establishing his/their /ocus standi to 9 achieve the purposes envisaged by the Constitution. In the instant case, the petitioner has relied upon various judgments of this Court to determine his focus standi but he has lost sight of the fact that jurisdiction has to be exercised subject to consideration by the Court that a question of public importance with reference to enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights has been raised. Essentially, consideration of the Court remains on the existence of public importance, which is to be interpreted depending upon the particular facts raised before it on a case to case basis. A citizen who invokes the jurisdiction of the Court is bound to satisfy the Court that he has come before the Court with bona fide intentions and therefore, he has /ocus standi to seek enforcement of the Fundamental Rights in question. In the cases relied upon by him, this Court exercised jurisdiction where it was established that violation of any one or more Fundamental Rights were involved. It would be appropriate to note that in the case of Benazir Bhutto v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 1988 SC 416 this Court held that after all, the law is not a closed shop and even in the adversarial procedure, it is permissible for the next of kin or friends to move the Court on behalf of a minor or a person under disability, or a person under detention or in restraint. Why not then a person, if he were to act bona fide to activate a Court for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights of a group or a class of persons who are unable to seek relief from the Court for several reasons. Article 184 3 does not say as to what proceedings should be followed. Whatever its nature may be must be judged in light of the purpose, that is, the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights. The said Article provides abundant scope for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights of an individual or a group or a class of persons in the event of their 10 infraction. However, it would be for the Court to generally lay down the contours in order to regulate the proceedings initiated by a group or class actions from case to case. Having regard to the connotation of the words public importance , it will be for the Supreme Court to consider each case to determine whether an element of public importance is involved in the enforcement of Fundamental Rights irrespective of the violation of an individual s rights or the infractions against the rights of a group or a class of persons. The Court granted relief on the ground that the petitioner had succeeded to show the violation of his Fundamental Rights provided under Article 17 of the Constitution. In the case of Muhammad Saifullah Khan v. Federation of Pakistan 1989 SCMR 22 , this Court declined to accept the plea of the petitioner with regard to unconstitutionality of certain amendments made in the Delimitation of Constituencies Ordinance, 1988 and Representation of People Ordinance, 1988 and for declaring the constitution of Election Commission to be illegal, on the ground that he invoked the jurisdiction of the Court under Article 184 3 of the Constitution without alleging any infringement of his Fundamental Rights for the enforcement of which he sought to invoke the jurisdiction of the Court. In the case of Shehla Zia v. WAPDA PLD 1994 SC 693 , though the proceedings were initiated on a letter but the relief was granted for the reasons that violation of Article 9 of the Constitution had been proven. In the case of Yasmin Khan v. Election Commission of Pakistan 1994 SCMR 113 , the petitioners who were permanent residents of Pakistan but were earning their livelihood abroad, sought enrolment as voters in the electoral rolls. In the case of Al-Jehad Trust v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 1996 SC 324 , the appointment of the Chief Justice of Pakistan and other Judges of the 11 superior judiciary was challenged for being contrary to the mode prescribed in the Constitution for such appointments. It was held that this Court is entitled to take cognizance of a matter which involves a question of public importance with reference to any of the Fundamental Rights conferred by Chapter 1 of Part II of the Constitution, even suo motu, without requiring any formal petition. The relief was granted as the Court found that the petitioner s right of access to justice for all enshrined in Article 25 of the Constitution was violated. In the case of Asad Ali v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 1998 SC 161 , relief was granted to the petitioner on the ground that the petitioner had /ocus standi to approach this Court as his right to have free, fair and equal access to an independent and impartial tribunal granted under Articles 9 and 25 of the Constitution was violated. Proceedings in the case of Ardeshir Cowasjee v. Karachi Building Control Authority 1999 SCMR 2883 were initiated under Article 185 3 of the Constitution against the judgment of Lahore High Court and thus not applicable in the instant case. Further, the petitioner had succeeded in proving a violation of Article 25 of the Constitution as construction of high rise buildings was allowed on an amenity plot in a park. In the case of Wattan Party v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 2006 SC 697 , relief was granted to the petitioners on the ground of violation of Articles 4 and 9 of the Constitution. In the case of Sindh High Court Bar Association v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 2009 SC 879 , the Proclamation of Emergency and issuance of PCO of 2007 was challenged. The Court declared the petition to be maintainable on the ground that violation of Fundamental Rights of the petitioners under Articles 9 and 25 was involved. 12 13. An analysis of the above referred case law shows that in all these cases, the Court was inclined to grant relief where the petitioner s therein succeeded in establishing the violation of any of the Fundamental Rights conferred by Chapter 1 Part II of the Constitution. In the instant case, neither violation of any of the Fundamental Rights has been listed in the petition nor established during the course of arguments. 14. It is to be noted that the petitioner has acquired the citizenship of Canada and has taken an oath inter alia to pledge his loyalty and allegiance to Canada, and as such this disqualifies him from contesting elections to Parliament, in view of the bar contained in Article 63 1 c of the Constitution which has been elaborately discussed in the case of Syed Mehmood Akhtar Naqvi v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 2012 SC 1089 . It is to be noted that after acquiring the citizenship of another country and pledging his loyalty to that country, he has to lose some of his rights including the right to be elected as Member of Parliament, even though he does not lose his Pakistani citizenship as well as other rights granted under the Constitution and the law, as a consequence of his dual nationality. 15. Similarly, a person who has acquired dual citizenship can claim his individual rights such as the right to acquire property or other private rights and can also sue for the enforcement of such rights. This court has been entertaining such petitions in the past. Reference may be made to Constitution Petition No.15/2007 Amjad Malik v. Federation of Pakistan . The said petition was clubbed with identical petitions, wherein the action of former President of Pakistan against one of us Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, Chief Justice of Pakistan was challenged. Chief Justice of Pakistan Iftikhar 13 Muhammad Chaudhry v. President of Pakistan PLD 2010 SC 61 . In the said case, the petitioner, Amjad Malik introduced himself as a life member of the Supreme Court Bar Association and a SolicitorAdvocate of the Supreme Court of England Wales, member of International Bar Association and current chair of Association of Pakistan Lawyers UK practicing from his office at 149 Dark Street, Rochadle, OL 11 IEF UK . He made the following prayer:- The leave to move a petition may graciously be granted as it involves a question of public importance as well as interpretation of Article of which the whole nation is concerned, and a larger is formed as Respondents have shown blatant disregard to the rule of law, and norms of Constitution and petitioner believes and disputes there is no term as such as non functional Chief Justice of Pakistan as it is only the Honourable Office of the Chief Justice which upholds the supremacy of the Constitution, the custodian and guardian of justice rule of law and the sooner larger bench settles the actual interpretation of Article 209 and relevant proposition the better it is to avoid any further media trial of the sitting Chief Justice as well as future media trial of the sitting Chief Justice as well as future Chief Justice s of Pakistan. Petitioner fears that filing a reference under Art.209 may be used as ploy with mala fide intentions to remove a pro active Chief Justice in future if the law is not settled now and may create serius legal questions for the independence of judiciary and safety of the work and well being of the judges of the Superior Court. It is also prayed that direction may be issued to Respondent to remove all restraints on the Chief Justice, allow him and his family move freely, access to Chief Justice to Court and restore his protocol and privileges befitting to his office until reference and or the question of law is settled by this superior court and may be permitted to perform his functions in Court as Chief Justice of Pakistan. 16. It is abundantly clear that for a person to activise the jurisdiction of this Court as a public interest litigant, for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights of a group or a class of persons, he must show on the given facts that he is acting bona fide. However, it would be for this Court to decide, on the given facts 14 whether he is acting bona fide or not and whether the petition is suffering from laches or not. 17. It is a settled principle of law that mala fides are to be pleaded and proven by the persons so pleading whereas bona fides are always to be apparent or should be shown from the record. It is also settled that the superior Courts exercise discretionary jurisdiction conferred under Articles 184 3 of the Constitution where the petitioner succeeds in establishing his bona fides from the record. Reference may be made to the cases of Shahid Hussain Qureshi v. Manager SBFC 2001 YLR 454 . Similarly, in the case of Wagar Haider Butt v. Judge Family Court 2009 SCMR 1243 this Court has held that constitutional jurisdiction is always discretionary in nature and he who seeks equity must come with clean hands. 18. It may also be noted that the expression bona fide , for the purpose of invoking jurisdiction of this Court under Article 184 3 of the Constitution, has to be applied in contradistinction to the expression mala fide . Because mala fides, if alleged against any person, is to be proven by bringing admissible evidence on record, as it has been held in the case of Government of West Pakistan v. Begum Agha Abdul Karim Shorish Kashmiri PLD 1969 SC 14 , whereas to prove bona fide, burden is placed upon the person who has approached the Court and persuaded it to exercise jurisdiction, particularly with reference to the circumstances of the instant case. The expression, bona fide has been defined as per dictionary meanings as follows: - Corpus Juris Secundum : Latin literally, by or in good faith . It has been defined as meaning acting honestly without purpose to defraud; good 15 faith, as distinguished from bad fait; honest; without fraud or unfair dealing; also, in a derived sense, real. Chambers 20 Century Dictionary: In good faith; genuine . The word genuine means natural: not spurious: pure: sincere . Law Dictionary, Mosley and Whitley: Bona fide means good faith, without fraud or deceit. Stroud s Judicial Dictionary: Bona fide . 1 The equivalent of this phrase is honestly ... Concise Law Dictionary of Osborn: Bona fide - In good faith, honestly, without fraud, collusion or participation in wrong-doing. While dealing with the question of bona fides of a petitioner, especially in the case of a person approaching the Court in the name of Public Interest Litigation, the Indian Supreme Court in the case of Ashok Kumar Pandey v. State of West Bengal AIR 2004 SC 280 has held as under: - Public interest litigation is a weapon which has to be used with great care and circumspection and the judiciary has to be extremely careful to see that behind the beautiful veil of public interest an ugly private malice, vested interest and/or publicity seeking is not lurking. It is to be used as an effective weapon in the armory of law for delivering social justice to the citizens. The attractive brand name of public interest litigation should not be used for suspicious products of mischief. It should be aimed at redressal of genuine public wrong or public injury and not publicity oriented or founded on personal vendetta. As indicated above, Court must be careful to see that a body of persons or member of public, who approaches the court is acting bona fide and not for personal gain or private motive or political motivation or other oblique consideration. The Court must not allow its process to be abused for oblique considerations. Some persons with vested interest indulge in the pastime of meddling with judicial process either by force of habit or from improper motives. Often they are 16 actuated by a desire to win notoriety or cheap popularity. The petitions of such busy bodies deserve to be thrown out by rejection at the threshold, and in appropriate cases with exemplary costs. Emphasis supplied Relying upon the said case, this Court in the case of Dr. Akhtar Hassan Khan v. Federation of Pakistan 2012 SCMR 455 has held that while holding that the petitions are maintainable, the Court has to guard against frivolous petitions as it is a matter of common observation that in the garb of Public Interest Litigation, matters are brought before the Court which are neither of public importance nor relatable to enforcement of a Fundamental Right or public duty. 19. Applying the above stated principle to the facts of instant case, it is to be observed that this country, after having remained in the clouds of extra-constitutional eras from time to time, as has been discussed in the case of Sindh High Court Bar Association supra finally succeeded in establishing a democratic order in the country through the process of elections when General Elections were held on 18.2.2008. Thereafter, all the unconstitutional actions of the then Military Regime were declared non est by this Court in the above cited judgment, including the appointment of Judges, who violated the restraint order passed by a seven-member Bench of this Court on 3.11.2007 against the Military Regime and appointment of Judges who were appointed on the recommendations of an unconstitutionally appointed Chief Justice, including the incumbent Attorney General of Pakistan. It is heartening to note that all unconstitutional actions of the Military Regime were also not confirmed by the Parliament, as it is manifest from the 18 Constitutional Amendment. Since then, the democratic system has continued for a period of 5 years, as the Parliament is about to complete its term on or before 18.03.2013, and 17 approximately 80 million registered voters are ready to elect their representatives within the coming few months. For that reason, at this critical stage, no one amongst the 180 to 200 million citizens or registered voters has come forward to question the appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner and Members of the ECP, who were appointed vide notifications dated 16.7.2012 and 16.6.2011 respectively. At the same time, no objection or reservation has been admittedly shown to such appointments by the 342 incumbent Members of the National Assembly and 104 Members of the Senate as well as 65, 124, 371 and 168 Members of the Provincial Assemblies of Balochistan, KPK, Punjab and Sindh respectively. Nor have the prospective candidates for the forthcoming Elections raised a question of public importance for enforcement of any of their Fundamental Rights, either in this Court or before any of the Provincial High Courts, for the simple reason that the entire nation is fully ready for the forthcoming elections. Further, the ECP has also geared up the process of Elections and statistical pre-poll preparations have almost been completed by taking all necessary steps in accordance with the Constitution and law, as well as the recommendations made by this Court in the cases of Imran Khan v. Election Commission of Pakistan 2012 SCMR 448 and Workers Party Pakistan v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 2012 SC 681 . In such a situation, the appointments to the ECP both the Chief Election Commissioner and Members of the Commission have been challenged by a person, who though can exercise his own right to vote but is disqualified from contesting Elections in view of the bar contained in Article 63 1 c of the Constitution, for the relief which has been noted hereinabove. It may not be out of context to note that in the speech delivered by the 18 petitioner on 23.12.2012 at Lahore transcript of which he has provided himself , he insisted upon the invocation of Article 254 of the Constitution to delay the elections. Relevant portion thereof is reproduced here: - Gil lS 2S Leal sil jue AS 55 lS AS SIS 28 US asl dey 8 alls Sy gales! ie le Liga 9S als Gul pail jail S Gas -ux i elections 55! interim government ux use 4: S 2 8 Lala ls os! ol ysl if amy act au lS LAS AS pa GS ol within a particular 3 ails Ua sl jail jail US ails phe S 53! period and it is not done within that period the Sus bi ES os si UKs a 4 ul -S period ules pass 5 doing of the act or thing shall not be invalid 18 58 G38 Ctl GS 5! gl GE act 05 2S los SBS CS os OL CS usl Liles 84: period 5 S CS Oail AS US Ue Gs!

It is to be noted that the petitioner, to achieve his declared agenda, admittedly led a Long March from Lahore to Islamabad on 14.01.2013, which was concluded after a bilateral agreement dated 16.01.2013 signed between him and the coalition Government. In one of the clauses whereof it was provided that the parties shall examine the dissolution of the ECP. It is not known whether a decision, if any, 19 was taken officially in this behalf, but it seems that following the above events, instant petition has been filed. If the facts and circumstances noted above are put in juxtaposition, no difficulty is experienced in holding that the petitioner lacks bona fides in approaching this Court under Article 184 3 of the Constitution. 21. As the petitioner lacks bona fides, therefore, at one stage he stated that he has instituted instant petition in the nature of quo warranto. We enquired from him as to whether he had any objection s to the eligibility or competency of the Chief Election Commissioner and the Members of the Election Commission? He replied that he had no such objection against them. Learned Attorney General for Pakistan also stated that the petitioner has laid information before this Court to exercise/issue a writ in the nature of quo warranto. Suffice it to say that in view of the above noted statement of the petitioner about eligibility and competence of Chief Election Commissioner and Members a writ of quo warranto cannot be issued. For these reasons the Chief Election Commissioner and Members of the ECP have not been made party in this petition. Therefore, the cases noted in the petition, being distinguishable, are not attracted. It must also be explained that in Sindh High Court Bar Association s case ibid no writ of quo warranto was issued. The Judges who took oath under PCO and Oath of Office Judges Order in violation of the order of this Court dated 03.11.2007 were declared to have rendered themselves liable to action under and in accordance with the Constitution. Resultantly, notices for Contempt of Court were issued to them and they subsequently submitted their resignations from such positions voluntarily. Additionally, the appointments of the Judges which were made without the requisite consultation of the de jure Chief Justice of 20 Pakistan were declared to be unconstitutional, illegal, void ab initio and of no legal effect. The judges so removed approached this Court by means of review petitions which were dismissed by the judgment dated 13.10.2009 in the case of Justice Khurshid Anwar Bhinder v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 2010 SC 483 . Thus, clearly moulded relief of issuing writ of quo warranto reflects on the bona fides of the petitioner for these added reasons as well. 22. It is now a settled position in our system of administration of justice that relief is not to be denied to the litigants on technical consideration. However, in peculiar circumstances where the Courts, owing a duty to preserve and protect the Constitution, consider that on the one hand, the object of a case and the relief sought from the Court as under Article 184 3 by one person alone as against public at large. The question of maintainability of proceedings would arise that of suffering from an infirmity/hurdle to effect the result of such proceedings and cannot be left unnoticed by the Court. A constitutional bar of limitation is not applicable to the proceedings under Article 199 or Article 184 of the Constitution, however, insistence is placed on initiating proceedings promptly and within a reasonable time to avoid the question of laches. 23. The doctrine of laches has been discussed in detail by this Court in the case of State Bank of Pakistan v. Imtiaz Ali Khan 2012 PLC C.S. 218 . Relevant portion from the judgment is reproduced here:- 30. ww. Laches is a doctrine whereunder a party which may have a right, which was otherwise enforceable, loses such right to the extent of its enforcement if it is found by the Court of a law that its case is hit by the doctrine of laches/limitation. Right remains with the party but it cannot enforce it. The limitation is examined by the 21 Limitation Act or by special laws which have inbuilt provisions for seeking relief against any grievance within the time specified under the law and if party aggrieved do not approach the appropriate forum within the stipulated period/time, the grievance though remains but it cannot be redressed because if on one hand there was a right with a party which he could have enforced against the other but because of principle of limitation/laches, same right then vests/accrues in favour of the opposite party. It is settled principle of our jurisprudence as well that delay defeats equity and that equity aids the vigilant and not the indolent. In the case of Jawad Mir Muhammadi v. Haroon Mirza PLD 2007 SC 472 , a full Bench of this Court has held that lathes per se is not a bar to the constitutional jurisdiction and question of delay in filing would have to be examined with reference to the facts of each case; question of delay/lathes in filing constitutional petition has to be given serious consideration and unless a satisfactory and plausible explanation is forthcoming for delay in filing , constitutional petition, the same cannot be overlooked or ignored subject to facts and circumstances of each case. In this very case reference has also been made to words of Lord Camden L.C. from the judgment of Smith v. Clay 1767 3 Bro. C.C. 639n at 640n wherein it has been observed that a Court of equity has always refused its aid to stale demands, where a party has slept upon his right and acquiesced for a great length of time; nothing can call forth this Court into activity, but conscience, good faith, and reasonable diligence, where these are wanting the Court is passive, and does nothing . Cited judgment also refers to a book titled Snell s Equity by John Meghee 13th Edition, wherein at it has been observed that the doctrine of laches in Courts of equity is not an arbitrary or a technical doctrine; where it would be practically unjust to give a remedy, either because the party has, by his conduct, done that which might fairly be regarded as equivalent to a waiver of it, or where by his conduct and neglect he has, though perhaps not waiving that remedy, yet put the other party in a situation in which it would not be reasonable to place him if the remedy were afterwards to be asserted in either of these lapse of time and delay are most material . In Member S R / Chief Settlement Commissioner v. Ashfaque Ali PLD 2003 SC 132 , this Court has held that writ jurisdiction is undoubtedly discretionary and extraordinary which may not be invoked by a party who demonstrates a style of slackness and laxity on his part: law is well-settled that a party guilty of gross negligence and laches is not entitled to the equitable relief. In S.A. Jameel v. Secretary to the Govt. of the Punjab 22 2005 SCMR 126 , this Court while addressing the question of laches has observed that there is marked distinction between delay in filing of a legal proceedings within the period specified under the provisions of Limitation Act, 1908 and undue time consumed by a party in filing of Constitutional petition, for which no statutory period is prescribed under the law; in the former case, delay of - each day is to be explained by furnishing sufficient cause for enlargement of time and condonation of delay within the contemplation of section 5 of the Limitation Act whereas in the later case lapse of time or the question of lathes has to be examined on equitable principles for the reason that the exercise of Constitutional jurisdiction is always discretionary with the Court and the relief so granted is always in the nature of equitable relief in case if the Court finds that the party invoking writ jurisdiction of the High Court is guilty of contumacious lethargy, inaction, laxity or gross negligence in the prosecution or a cause for enforcement of a right, the Court would be justified in nonsuiting such person on the premise of laches emphasis provided . Hon ble Mr. Justice Rana Bhagwandas as he then was , also relied upon the following para of Pakistan Post Office v. Settlement Commissioner 1987 SCMR 1119 :- There is absolutely no justification to equate laches with statutory bar of limitation. While the former operates as a bar in equity, the latter operates as a legal bar to the grant of remedy. Thus, in the former, all the dictates of justice and equity and balance of legitimate rights are to be weighed, in the latter, subject to statutory relaxations in this behalf nothing is left to the discretion of the Court. It is a harsh law. Thus, passage of time per se brings the statute of limitation in operation, but the bar of laches does not deny the grant of right or slice the remedy unless the grant of relief in addition to being delayed, must also perpetuate injustice to another party. It is also in this very context that the condonation of delay under section 5 of the Limitation Act will be on different harder considerations than those in a case of laches. For, example, while it is essential to explain and condone the delay of each day vis-a-vis statutory limitation, there is no such strict requirement in cases of laches. The doctrine of laches was also under discussion and dealt with by Privy Council in the judgment reported as John Objobo Agbeyegbe, v. Festus Makene Ikomi PLD 1953 PC 19 where the Lord Oakseyquoted the following para from Erlanger v. New Sombrero Phosphate Company 1878 LR 3 AC at :- In Lindsay Petroleum Company v. Hurd LR 5 PC 23 239 it is Said: The doctrine of laches in Courts of Equity is not an arbitrary or a technical doctrine. Where it would be practically unjust to give a remedy, either because the party has, by his conduct done that which might fairly be regarded as equivalent to a waiver of it, or where, by his conduct and neglect he has, though perhaps not waiving that remedy, yet put the other party in a situation in which it would not be reasonable to place him if the remedy were afterwards to be asserted, in either of these cases lapse of time and delay are most material. But in every case if an argument against relief, which otherwise not amounting to a bar in any statute of limitations, the validity of that defence must be tried upon principles substantially equitable Two circumstances always important in such cases are the length of the delay and the nature of the acts done during the interval, which might affect either party and cause a balance of justice or injusticein taking the one course or the other, so far as relates to the remedy. In the instant case doctrine of laches will have double force against the respondent-employees because in the first instance they could not prove or show the infringement of any right as held by us in the T preceding paras hereinabove and secondly because they are guilty of laches in approaching the legal forum in for redressal of their grievance, if at all they had a legal and genuine grievance. In the case of Muhammad Azhar Siddiqui v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 2012 SC 774 , this Court has held that the Supreme Court retains the discretion to deny petitioners who approach the Court after undue delay or with unclean hands and the question as to whether a particular case involves the element of public importance is to be determined by the Court with reference to the facts and circumstances of each case. In the case of Dr. Akhtar Hussain Khan v. Federation of Pakistan 2012 SCMR 455 this Court after relying upon the judgment of the Indian Supreme Court in the case of Air India Ltd. v. Cochin International Airport Ltd. 2002 2 SCC 617 has held that in the event of some irregularity in the decision making process, the Court 24 must exercise its discretionary power of judicial review with circumspection and only in furtherance of public interest and not merely for making out a legal point. It should always keep the larger public interest in mind to interfere or not to interfere. 24. As pointed out by Mr. Muhammad Munir Peracha, learned counsel for the Election Commission of Pakistan, the petitioner came to Pakistan on 21.12.2012 and filed the instant petition on 07.02.2013 after almost a period of about two months, when the general elections are just around the corner. A number of bye-elections have been held under the supervision of incumbent Chief Election Commissioner and the Members of the Commission. The National Assembly as well as Provincial Assemblies are about to complete their Constitutional terms, Electoral Rolls by and large have been completed and as such much water has flown under the bridge. In such a situation, the arguments raised by the learned counsel for the Election Commission of Pakistan as well as the learned Attorney General that the petition is hit by laches, appeal to mind. 25. Laches are vital in the instant case, as noted hereinabove, the Election Commission is functioning from the day of the notification dated 6.2.2011 appointing the members, followed by notification dated 16.07.2012 of the appointment of Chief Election Commissioner. After having become fully functional, the Commission is headed towards holding elections and no one except the petitioner alone, as a voter, has questioned their appointments through the instant petition on 07.02.2013 which was taken up for hearing on 11.02.2013. Therefore, arguments of the Attorney General and Mr. Muhammad Munir Piracha, learned ASC in this behalf, in view of the discussion above is 25 accordingly accepted that the petition suffers from laches. Thus, it is held that the petition is not maintainable on this score as well. 26. As far as the other pre-requisite under Article 184 3 of the Constitution is concerned, namely, an element of public importance enabling this Court to exercise such jurisdiction, the petitioner, in addition to proving his bona fides in approaching this Court and seeking relief as has been prayed for by instituting instant petition, has to show that a question of public importance is involved in the matter and that therefore, Fundamental Rights have to be enforced. The expression public importance was interpreted in the cases of Manzoor Elahi v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 1975 SC 66 , Shahida Zaheer Abbasi v. President of Pakistan PLD 1996 SC 632 , Syed Zulfigar Mehdi v. Pakistan International Corporation 1998 SCMR 793 , wherefrom following principles have been determined: - a The term public is invariably employed in contradistinction to the terms private or individual and connotes, as an adjective, something pertaining to or belonging to the people; relating to a nation, State or community. In other words, it refers to something which is to be shared or participated in or enjoyed by the public at large, and is not limited or restricted to any particular class of the community. b The phrase public purpose , whatever else it may meet must include a purpose, that is an object or aim, in which the general interest of the community as opposed to the particular interest of individuals is directly and vitally concerned . c Itis quite clear that whether a particular case involved the element of public importance is a question which is first to be determined by this Court with reference to the facts and circumstances of each case. d The public importance should be viewed with reference to freedom and liberties guaranteed under Constitution, their protection and invasion of these Rights in a manner which raises a serious question regarding their enforcement irrespective of the fact whether such infraction of right, freedom or liberty is alleged by an individual or a group of individuals. e f 9 h 26 The issues arising in a case cannot be considered as a question of public importance if the decision of the issues affects only the Rights of an individual or a group of individuals. The issue, in order to assume the character of public importance, must be such that its decision affects the rights and liberties of people at large. The objective public necessarily implies a thing belonging to people at large, the nation, the State or a community as a whole. If a controversy is raised in which only a particular group of people is interested and the body of the people as a whole or the entire community has no interest, it cannot be treated as a case of public importance. In all systems of law which cherish individual freedom and liberty and which provide Constitutional safeguards and guarantees in this behalf, any invasion of such freedom in circumstances which raise serious questions regarding the effectiveness and availability of those safeguards, must be regarded as a matter of great public importance. This Court discussed in the case of Al-Jehad Trust v. Lahore High Court 2011 SCMR 1688 , all the cases wherein the scope of Article 184 3 with reference to the jurisdiction of this Court was highlighted, and held as under: - 11. We have also examined cases titled Zafar Ali Shah v. Pervez Musharraf PLD 2000 SC 869 , Qazi Hussain Ahmad v. Pervez Musharraf, Chief Executive PLD 2002 SC 853 , Sabir Shah v. Shad Muhammad Khan PLD 1995 SC 66 , Wattan Party v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 2006 SC 697 , Wasim Sajjad v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 2001 SC 233 , Muhammad Nawaz Sharif v. President of Pakistan PLD 1993 SC 473 , Amanullah Khan v. Chairman Medical Research Council 1995 SCMR 202 , Zulfiqar Mehdi v. Pakistan International Airlines Corporation 1998 SCMR 793 , All Pakistan Newspapers Society v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 2004 SC 600 , State Life Insurance Employees Federation v. Federal Government of Pakistan 1994 SCMR 1341 , Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 2004 SC 583 , Muhammad Siddique v. Government of Pakistan PLD 2005 Supreme Court 1 ,. Benazir Bhutto v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 1988 SC 416 , Javed Jabbar and 14 others v. Federation of Pakistan and others PLD 2003 Supreme Court 955 . The ratio of the judgment referred hereinabove is that unless the matter is of public importance relating to the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights conferred by Part II, Chapter 1 of the Constitution Articles 8 to 28 , the jurisdiction of the Court under Article 184 3 of the 27 Constitution, cannot be invoked. The mere importance of a matter, without enforcement of any fundamental right or reference to a fundamental right without any public importance, will not attract the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 184 3 of the Constitution. Consequently, we having considered the matter in the light of the law laid down by this Court in the judgments referred hereinabove, find that these petitions under Article 184 3 of the Constitution are not maintainable and we are not persuaded to agree with the assertion that in view of the nature of dispute and importance of the matter, the Court may ignore the objection and decide these petitions on merits. This may be pointed out that in the light of constitutional mandate as contemplated in Article 184 3 of the Constitution this Court may not entertain a direct petition under Article 184 3 in a matter not involving the enforcement of any of Fundamental Rights mentioned therein. The question raised in the present petitions do not as such relate to the Fundamental Rights conferred by Part II, Chapter 1 of the Constitution and most of these questions even otherwise are speculative and presumptive in nature at this stage. There is clear distinction between Article 199 and Article 184 3 of the Constitution and this Court has repeatedly held that in the matters which do not involve enforcement of the Fundamental Rights of the public at large as envisaged in Article 184 3 of the Constitution, a direct petition in original jurisdiction is not entertainable. Jamat-e-Islami v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 2008 SC 30 . 27. As the facts surrounding the instant petition are rather peculiar and merit a complete appreciation of the various factors involved, it is to be noted at the cost of repetition that the petitioner is a renowned, well reputed and respected religious scholar, jurist and professor of law. However, as per his own declaration in his petition and concise statement submitted before this Court, he is a citizen of Canada. He holds the nationality of Canada and carries a Canadian passport which he uses to travel the world for his frequent international engagements. As per his own admission, he only travels to Pakistan on his Pakistani passport and is otherwise allowed to enter, remain in and treated as a Canadian national throughout the world. As already noted hereinabove, acquisition of nationality of any foreign country is not an impediment by itself in filing a petition under Article   28 184 3 or 199 of the Constitution. However, there are other circumstances surrounding the matter that aggravate the effect of seeking relief through the enforcement of Fundamental Rights for all citizens of Pakistan. First and foremost, the petition is geared against the election Commission of Pakistan, an independent institution and creature of the Constitution that ensures the very strength, survival and continuity of our democratic system. Given that this is an election year, the importance of the Election Commission is highlighted more than ever and we must be ever more cautious to not even appear to be partaking in placing restrictions upon its independent and Constitutional functions. In this regard, this is certainly a matter of great public concern as it pertains to the deliverance of the right of representation through fair and free elections which has been held to be a key aspect of democracy identified by the Constitution in Workers Party Pakistan v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 2012 Sc 681 . Therefore, an attack on the constitutional validity of such an important institution cannot be well received from the petitioner. 28. From the perusal of the petition it is clear that the petitioner primarily has emphasized that the procedure provided in Articles 213 and 218 of the Constitution with regard to appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner as well as the Members of ECP has not been followed in letter and spirit. However, neither infraction of any of the Fundamental Rights has been listed in the petition nor enforcement of the same has been sought in the prayer clause; and even during the course of arguments the petitioner has failed to identify any of the Fundamental Rights, which may have been violated. Despite insistence of the Court, the petitioner did not show as to which of the Fundamental Rights had been violated. Thus, one of the 29 fundamental requirements of Article 184 3 of the Constitution, namely, the violation of any of the Fundamental Rights, enabling this Court to exercise jurisdiction conferred by said Article, is apparently missing in the instant case. 29. At this stage, it would be appropriate to consider the scope of Article 184 3 of the Constitution as deliberated upon by this Court in various pronouncements. In the cases of Benazir Bhutto Vv. Federation of Pakistan PLD 1988 SC 416 , it has been held as under:- Article 184 3 of the Constitution empowers Supreme Court to enforce the Fundamental Rights where the question of public importance arises in relation thereto. And if looked at from this angle it is hardly of any importance whether the Executive has passed a prejudicial order or not when the infraction of the Fundamental Rights takes place by the operation of the law itself. In this context what would be relevant would be the language of the provisions of the impugned Act itself. It will then not be a question of the Court merely granting a declaration as to the validity or invalidity of law in the abstract. An enactment may immediately on its coming into force take away or abridge the Fundamental Rights of a person by its very terms and without any further overt act being done. In such a case the infringement of the Fundamental Right is complete co instant the passing of the enactment and, therefore, there can be no reason why the person so prejudicially affected by the law should not be entitled immediately to avail himself of the constitutional remedy. To say that a person, whose fundamental Right has been infringed by the mere operation of an enactment, is not entitled to invoke the jurisdiction of Supreme Court for the enforcement of his right, will be to deny him the benefit of a salutary constitutional remedy which is itself his Fundamental Right. The infractions alleged cannot be regarded as seeking a declaration in the air or asking the Court to decide, in abstract, and for that matter hypothetical or contingent questions. Similarly, this Court in the case of Muhammad Nawaz Sharif v. President of Pakistan PLD 1993 SC 473 has held as under:- Article 184 3 of the Constitution of Pakistan pertains to original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and its object is to ensure the enforcement of Fundamental Rights referred to therein. This provision is an edifice of democratic way,,of life and manifestation of responsibility casts on this Court as a protector and guardian of the 30 Constitution. The jurisdiction conferred by it is fairly wide and the Court can make an order of the nature envisaged by Article 199, in a case where a question of public importance, with reference to enforcement of any fundamental right conferred by Chapter 1 of Part II of the Constitution is involved. Article 184 3 is remedial in character and is conditioned by three prerequisites, namely: - i There is a question of public importance. ii Such a question involves the enforcement of a fundamental right, and iii The fundamental right sought to be enforced is conferred by Chapter 1, Part II of the Constitution. In case of Jamat-e-Islami v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 2008 Supreme Court 30 following observations have been made:- 31. There are two essential conditions for invoking the jurisdiction of Supreme Court of Pakistan under Article 184 3 of the Constitution. The first condition is that subject matter of the petition under this Article must be of public importance and second condition is that it must relate to the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights conferred by Part II, Chapter 1 of the Constitution. We, therefore, in the light of law laid down by this Court on the subject, would like to examine the question whether the present petitions qualify the above test to entertain the same under Article 184 3 of the Constitution. In the case of Bank of Punjab v. Haris Steel Industries PLD 2010 SC 1109 relief was granted to the petitioner on the ground that the right of property granted under Articles 9 and 24 of the Constitution were involved, as due to gravest financial scams in the history of Pakistan, the bank stood cheated of an enormous amount of around 11 billions Rupees. In the case of Shahid Orakzai v. Pakistan PLD 2011 SC 365 the appointment of the Chairman National Accountability Bureau NAB was declared illegal and ultra vires the Constitution and the law on the ground that Article 5 2 of the Constitution mandated an obligation of obedience to the Constitution and law as an inviolable obligation of every citizen. In the case of Al-Jehad Trust v. Lahore High Court 2011 31 SCMR 1688 , a petition was filed under Article 184 3 of the Constitution against initiation of disciplinary proceedings against the District Sessions Judge/Special Judge Central Rawalpindi by the Lahore High Court. This Court declined to entertain the petition on the ground that the jurisdiction, as conferred upon this Court under Article 184 3 of the Constitution, can be exercised only where a question of public importance with reference to the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights was involved, which was missing in the said case. In the case of Workers Party Pakistan v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 2012 SC 681 , the petitioner invoked the original jurisdiction of this Court, questioning the contents of a memo published in a newspaper as being violative of the Fundamental Rights of the petitioners. The Court declared the petitions to be maintainable for the reasons that the issues involved in the case were justiciable and a question of public importance with reference to Fundamental Rights under Articles 9, 14 and 19A of the Constitution had been made out. 30. The upshot of the above discussion is that the burden of proof was upon the petitioner to demonstrate as to which of his fundamental rights had been infringed upon but he failed to point out an infraction of any of his fundamental rights. Thus, judgments relied upon by the petitioner are not attracted to the facts of the instant case. 31. Before parting with the judgment, it is to be noted with regard to the question of extending the right of vote to citizens of Pakistan living abroad, some of whom may be holding dual citizenship, that as a voter, the petitioner can also exercise his right of vote like other overseas Pakistanis whose names have been incorporated in the Electoral Rolls. This right has been recognized under the Constitution 32 and has also been held by this Court in the case of Yasmin Akhtar v. Election Commission of Paksitan 1994 SCMR 113 , which was finally disposed of vide judgment dated 18.12.1993 in Constitution Petition No.26/1993. Reference in this regard may also be made to the case Ch. Nasir Igbal v. Federation of Pakistan Constitutional Petition No.39/2011 etc. , wherein vide order dated 14.02.2013, the ECP was directed to ensure that all the overseas citizens of Pakistan, who are qualified/eligible for the registration of their votes in accordance with the Electoral Rolls Act, 1974 and the Rules framed thereunder must be registered before the forthcoming elections. 32. Hereinabove are the reasons of our short order of even date, which reads as under:- For reasons to be recorded later it is held that petitioner, Dr. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri has failed to make out a case for exercising the discretionary jurisdiction by this Court under Article 184 3 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, for the facts that violation of any of the Fundamental Rights under Chapter 1 of Part II of the Constitution has neither been listed in the petition nor established during course of arguments, despite of insistence by the Bench to do so. The petitioner has also failed to prove his bona fides in view of the facts, which have been noticed at the hearing of the case, to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court coupled with the fact that under the peculiar circumstances he has no locus standi to claim relief as it has been prayed for in the petition, inter alia, for the reasons that being a holder of dual citizenship, he is not qualified disqualified to contest the election to the Parliament in view of the constitutional bar under Article 63 1 c of the Constitution, which has been interpreted by this Court in the case of Syed Mehmood Akhtar Naqvi v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 2012 SC 1089 . 2. However, it is loudly and clearly observed that as a voter like other overseas Pakistanis, whose names have been incorporated in the Electoral Rolls, he can exercise his right of vote as this right is recognized under the Constitution and has 33 also been held by this Court in the case of Yasmin Khan v. Election Commission of Pakistan 1994 SCMR 113 , which was finally disposed of vide judgment in Constitution Petition 26/1993 dated 18.12.1993. Thus, the petition is dismissed. 3. Before parting with the short order, it is essential to note that at the time of concluding his arguments on the points noted hereinabove, he started making uncalled for aspersions against the member of the Bench, which are tantamount prima facie to undermine its authority calling for action against him for Contempt of Court under Article 204 3 of the Constitution read with section 3 of the Contempt of Court Ordinance, 2003. However we, while exercising restraint, have decided not to proceed against him following the principle that such jurisdiction has to be exercised sparingly on case to case basis.

Federation of Pakistan PLD 2008 Supreme Court 30 following observations have been made:- 31.", "There are two essential conditions for invoking the jurisdiction of Supreme Court of Pakistan under Article 184 3 of the Constitution.", "The first condition is that subject matter of the petition under this Article must be of public importance and second condition is that it must relate to the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights conferred by Part II, Chapter 1 of the Constitution.", "We, therefore, in the light of law laid down by this Court on the subject, would like to examine the question whether the present petitions qualify the above test to entertain the same under Article 184 3 of the Constitution.", "In the case of Bank of Punjab v. Haris Steel Industries PLD 2010 SC 1109 relief was granted to the petitioner on the ground that the right of property granted under Articles 9 and 24 of the Constitution were involved, as due to gravest financial scams in the history of Pakistan, the bank stood cheated of an enormous amount of around 11 billions Rupees.", "In the case of Shahid Orakzai v. Pakistan PLD 2011 SC 365 the appointment of the Chairman National Accountability Bureau NAB was declared illegal and ultra vires the Constitution and the law on the ground that Article 5 2 of the Constitution mandated an obligation of obedience to the Constitution and law as an inviolable obligation of every citizen.", "In the case of Al-Jehad Trust v. Lahore High Court 2011 31 SCMR 1688 , a petition was filed under Article 184 3 of the Constitution against initiation of disciplinary proceedings against the District Sessions Judge/Special Judge Central Rawalpindi by the Lahore High Court.", "This Court declined to entertain the petition on the ground that the jurisdiction, as conferred upon this Court under Article 184 3 of the Constitution, can be exercised only where a question of public importance with reference to the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights was involved, which was missing in the said case.", "In the case of Workers Party Pakistan v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 2012 SC 681 , the petitioner invoked the original jurisdiction of this Court, questioning the contents of a memo published in a newspaper as being violative of the Fundamental Rights of the petitioners.", "The Court declared the petitions to be maintainable for the reasons that the issues involved in the case were justiciable and a question of public importance with reference to Fundamental Rights under Articles 9, 14 and 19A of the Constitution had been made out.", "The upshot of the above discussion is that the burden of proof was upon the petitioner to demonstrate as to which of his fundamental rights had been infringed upon but he failed to point out an infraction of any of his fundamental rights.", "Thus, judgments relied upon by the petitioner are not attracted to the facts of the instant case.", "Before parting with the judgment, it is to be noted with regard to the question of extending the right of vote to citizens of Pakistan living abroad, some of whom may be holding dual citizenship, that as a voter, the petitioner can also exercise his right of vote like other overseas Pakistanis whose names have been incorporated in the Electoral Rolls.", "This right has been recognized under the Constitution 32 and has also been held by this Court in the case of Yasmin Akhtar v. Election Commission of Paksitan 1994 SCMR 113 , which was finally disposed of vide judgment dated 18.12.1993 in Constitution Petition No.26/1993.", "Reference in this regard may also be made to the case Ch.", "Nasir Igbal v. Federation of Pakistan Constitutional Petition No.39/2011 etc.", ", wherein vide order dated 14.02.2013, the ECP was directed to ensure that all the overseas citizens of Pakistan, who are qualified/eligible for the registration of their votes in accordance with the Electoral Rolls Act, 1974 and the Rules framed thereunder must be registered before the forthcoming elections.", "Hereinabove are the reasons of our short order of even date, which reads as under:- For reasons to be recorded later it is held that petitioner, Dr. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri has failed to make out a case for exercising the discretionary jurisdiction by this Court under Article 184 3 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, for the facts that violation of any of the Fundamental Rights under Chapter 1 of Part II of the Constitution has neither been listed in the petition nor established during course of arguments, despite of insistence by the Bench to do so.", "The petitioner has also failed to prove his bona fides in view of the facts, which have been noticed at the hearing of the case, to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court coupled with the fact that under the peculiar circumstances he has no locus standi to claim relief as it has been prayed for in the petition, inter alia, for the reasons that being a holder of dual citizenship, he is not qualified disqualified to contest the election to the Parliament in view of the constitutional bar under Article 63 1 c of the Constitution, which has been interpreted by this Court in the case of Syed Mehmood Akhtar Naqvi v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 2012 SC 1089 .", "However, it is loudly and clearly observed that as a voter like other overseas Pakistanis, whose names have been incorporated in the Electoral Rolls, he can exercise his right of vote as this right is recognized under the Constitution and has 33 also been held by this Court in the case of Yasmin Khan v. Election Commission of Pakistan 1994 SCMR 113 , which was finally disposed of vide judgment in Constitution Petition 26/1993 dated 18.12.1993.", "Before parting with the short order, it is essential to note that at the time of concluding his arguments on the points noted hereinabove, he started making uncalled for aspersions against the member of the Bench, which are tantamount prima facie to undermine its authority calling for action against him for Contempt of Court under Article 204 3 of the Constitution read with section 3 of the Contempt of Court Ordinance, 2003.", "However we, while exercising restraint, have decided not to proceed against him following the principle that such jurisdiction has to be exercised sparingly on case to case basis.", "Chief Justice Judge Judge Islamabad, the 13 February, 2013 Nisar/ APPROVED FOR REPORTING orb CrP bun ABI evik yey 5 Jevldy 1162013 eee, KE Soe i 4 AS eb Sai pb 4-13 a et Bus ah Asrtiptigste gpk wPolh : Neely et Jz Lelwh bret ee SAU Binal SIL ae bbs otedokl Belts LEB hole 1201354713 611: ae Gt Lb VPRO LIM ter Se Bi Cur ify a te Ae Cle SUL el Fe Ut pele Lz Uk wee Wl on Gl SLI OF bus Solas celles GIT Ll Sunt GU Le FIR ep TU tee Seb but of TAT PL GEE a te SPY EV L 4 Sst earch iN sk byeeusl HL I fTSZ PAPE WL yeu Fle 56S coc PLbay Eb tn be le Yo b HL Sah pb Fb IS eid FL 184 3 KIL of Tels 2 2 Lull 6b Bo Utetvet Sted dugidet BIE ft bed Sue TA Hur iae i LU MeN ee UL Felty We UP AY 218 1213 sh Foi Seb Sob elles LP SIS WIL A A Sy ii KE 61973 2f wt of al WF Foe St 7 gt LU Pek L ite bEL Hs Ut 218 2 a b 11!", "213 2 a SIE Ii sleber SE BK ylules Zt elPle tt -Exn BNL Ie Ue sa KLE Os J ut oT ft Fi PEI ot bn HOLES FALL LGC ber ul wT Syhe Sib FL 218 2 b KIL ef Tz 16.06.2011 2.F.3 13 /2010-Estt-!", "Sete babe L ale ede Ltt weFl STOW Lf BCS av wt L Ble GY GAL os vi uit ot wl BL eb BW ut 16.07.2012 1F.5 7 /2011-PA C Pes A Ob L219 BIL of Ta bn hy HPL Pe ee 6 We SU FOF eB L Fi bbe SFE SCF tr leone Unb SETI, ble 6 CWP E eer ty Gb se Sured ul al 66 Udi byeut Fo AA Cutt eed OF ete Fi od Sur UE 2013G2FL55 BTL of TeP ire Ole ip ABIL eWIL we eeldy war op bb La LE Se Je GS ek Wi diez WEE MPS ti YE az tt 2 ES 702.2013 BPE Shetek OGL Me toerr Ten BU AK be SLIP ok BIS 11.02.2013 E 1756/2013 4 eit OF?", "Wis 242 14.2.2013 2 -

DG (Elections)\nMr. Sanaullah Malik, Director (L)\n\n\nCMA.64/2013, ete. 2\n\nDate of Hearing > 13.03.2013.\nORDER\n\nMr. Muhammad Munir Paracha, the learned counsel\nwho appeared on behalf of the Election Commission of Pakistan,\nhas furnished details of all the steps being taken for arranging\nfree and fair election, and in this respect, a request has been made\nto the Government of Pakistan for legislation. He has stated that\nout of the same, one relates to the amendment in Section 104 of\nthe Representation of the People Act, 1996 (ROPA), by insertion\nof Section 104B. The proposed provision reads as follows:\n\n“25. Insertion of section 104B, Act LXXXV\nof 1976.- In the said Act, after section 104A,\ninserted as aforesaid, the following new section\nshall be inserted, namely,\n\n“104B. Monitoring of election\ncampaign, etc. (1) The Commission\nshall appoint teams of monitors\nconsisting of such number of\nmembers as may be determined by\nthe Commission, for a constituency\nor a group of constituencies which\nshall monitor election campaign of\nthe candidates and shall report in\nthe format approved by the\nCommission violations of the code\nof conduct on daily basis, if any, by\nthe candidates, to the District\nReturning Officer.\n\n(2) The District Returning\nOfficer, on receipt of reports\nmentioned in sub-rule (1), shall\nproceed in accordance with the\n\nCMA.64/2013, ete. 3\n\nprovisions of Section 86B(1) of the\nAct.”\n\nBut the Government of Pakistan has shown reservations in\nmaking the said amendment.\n\n2. Mr. Bilal Hassan Minto, learned counsel for the\npetitioner pointed out that in substance the above amendment\nrelates to one of the observation of this Court in the case of\n\nWorkers’ Party Pakistan through Akhtar Hussain, Advocate,\n\nGeneral Secretary and 6 others v. Federation of Pakistan and 2\n\nothers (PLD 2012 SC 681). He had made reference to an extent\nthere from, which is reproduced herein below:\n\n(b) The Election Commission is\nempowered to check not just illegal actions\nrelating to the election (violating the limits\nset for campaign finance, etc.) or corrupt\npractices (bribery, etc.), but is also\nempowered to review all election activities,\nincluding Jalsas, Jaloos, use of\nloudspeakers, etc. for their effects on the\nstandards of ‘fairness, justness and honesty’\nthat elections are expected to meet. The\nElection Commission is also empowered to\ntake pre-emptive measures to ensure that\nthe spirit of democracy and ‘fairness,\njustness and honesty’ of elections is fully\nobserved. The Election Commission is,\ntherefore, directed to take all necessary\nsteps to ensure the same;.””\n\n3. Mr. Hamid Khan, learned Sr. ASC the counsel for one\n\nof the political parties i.e. PTI, while addressing the Court and\n\nCMA.64/2013, ete. 4\n\nsupporting the application of Article 218(3) of the Constitution of\nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, contended that the\nElection Commission is charged with making arrangements as\nare necessary to ensure that the election is conducted honestly,\njustly, freely and in accordance with law and that corrupt\npractices are guarded against, therefore, while making such\narrangements, monitoring of the election campaign, etc., as it\nhas been proposed in Section 104B of the ROPA, 1976, is most\nvital by any standard as this mechanism shall empower the\nElection Commission to arrange the elections to achieve the\nobjects in terms of Article 218(3) of the Constitution,\nparticularly, to guard against corrupt practices. The amendment\nso being sought is already part of the judgment as noted\nhereinabove and it has a binding force on all concerned,\nincluding the candidates, voters and the citizens who all are\ninterested in ensuring that the country is governed by the chosen\nrepresentatives and it is the requirement of the day that such\nchosen representatives must be elected by holding a free and fair\nelection and such representatives should not suffer from any kind\nof corruption nor they should adopt any corrupt measures during\nthe process of election. Therefore, to guard against such corrupt\n\npractices the Government of Pakistan should have no objection in\n\nCMA.64/2013, ete. 5\n\nthis behalf as it is the requirement of the Constitution, as noted\nherein above.\n\n4. Learned Deputy Attorney General appeared on behalf\nof the Government of Pakistan but without making any\ncomments. We would like to have the view point of the learned\nDeputy Attorney General, who stated that as he could not seek\ninstructions regarding the order dated 12.03.2013 as copy of the\nsaid order was received by him late.\n\n5. We have also directed on 12.03.2013 that the learned\ncounsel for the parties to file details of the measures in respect of\nwhich the Election Commission has sought amendment and the\nreaction of the Government thereto in order to resolve the\ndifficulties, if any, and also to examine as to whether there is any\ninterest at all in the implementation of the judgment noted herein\nabove. However, details have been submitted by the Election\nCommission of Pakistan but the learned counsel is directed that\nhe should obtain further instructions from by the Election\nCommission.\n\n6. Learned counsel appearing for the Election\nCommission is directed to bifurcate these details firstly showing\nthe portion which is to be implemented in pursuance of the\n\ndirections of this Court in the judgment noted herein above, and\n\nCMA.64/2013, ete. 6\n\nfor which no legislation is called for. Secondly with a separate\nportion in respect of those directions, observations and\nimprovements that the Election Commission on its own intends\nto achieve the objective under Article 218(3) of the Constitution,\nso that the matter could be resolved. This exercise must be\ncarried out as early as possible. On receipt of the reply and after\nhearing the parties’ counsel further appropriate orders shall be\npassed in this behalf, as the general elections are around the\ncorner. Therefore, there should be no delay by any corner and\nthey should do the needful as is required to be done under the\nConstitution and the law as early as could be possible in the\n\ngreater national interest.\n\n7.

He has stated that out of the same, one relates to the amendment in Section 104 of the Representation of the People Act, 1996 ROPA , by insertion of Section 104B. The proposed provision reads as follows: 25. Insertion of section 104B, Act LXXXV of 1976.- In the said Act, after section 104A, inserted as aforesaid, the following new section shall be inserted, namely, 104B. Monitoring of election campaign, etc. 1 The Commission shall appoint teams of monitors consisting of such number of members as may be determined by the Commission, for a constituency or a group of constituencies which shall monitor election campaign of the candidates and shall report in the format approved by the Commission violations of the code of conduct on daily basis, if any, by the candidates, to the District Returning Officer. 2 The District Returning Officer, on receipt of reports mentioned in sub-rule 1 , shall proceed in accordance with the CMA.64/2013, ete. 3 provisions of Section 86B 1 of the Act. But the Government of Pakistan has shown reservations in making the said amendment. 2. Mr. Bilal Hassan Minto, learned counsel for the petitioner pointed out that in substance the above amendment relates to one of the observation of this Court in the case of Workers Party Pakistan through Akhtar Hussain, Advocate, General Secretary and 6 others v. Federation of Pakistan and 2 others PLD 2012 SC 681 . He had made reference to an extent there from, which is reproduced herein below: b The Election Commission is empowered to check not just illegal actions relating to the election violating the limits set for campaign finance, etc. or corrupt practices bribery, etc. , but is also empowered to review all election activities, including Jalsas, Jaloos, use of loudspeakers, etc. for their effects on the standards of fairness, justness and honesty that elections are expected to meet. The Election Commission is also empowered to take pre-emptive measures to ensure that the spirit of democracy and fairness, justness and honesty of elections is fully observed. The Election Commission is, therefore, directed to take all necessary steps to ensure the same;. 3. Mr. Hamid Khan, learned Sr. ASC the counsel for one of the political parties i.e. PTI, while addressing the Court and CMA.64/2013, ete. 4 supporting the application of Article 218 3 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, contended that the Election Commission is charged with making arrangements as are necessary to ensure that the election is conducted honestly, justly, freely and in accordance with law and that corrupt practices are guarded against, therefore, while making such arrangements, monitoring of the election campaign, etc., as it has been proposed in Section 104B of the ROPA, 1976, is most vital by any standard as this mechanism shall empower the Election Commission to arrange the elections to achieve the objects in terms of Article 218 3 of the Constitution, particularly, to guard against corrupt practices. The amendment so being sought is already part of the judgment as noted hereinabove and it has a binding force on all concerned, including the candidates, voters and the citizens who all are interested in ensuring that the country is governed by the chosen representatives and it is the requirement of the day that such chosen representatives must be elected by holding a free and fair election and such representatives should not suffer from any kind of corruption nor they should adopt any corrupt measures during the process of election. Therefore, to guard against such corrupt practices the Government of Pakistan should have no objection in CMA.64/2013, ete. 5 this behalf as it is the requirement of the Constitution, as noted herein above. 4. Learned Deputy Attorney General appeared on behalf of the Government of Pakistan but without making any comments. We would like to have the view point of the learned Deputy Attorney General, who stated that as he could not seek instructions regarding the order dated 12.03.2013 as copy of the said order was received by him late. 5. We have also directed on 12.03.2013 that the learned counsel for the parties to file details of the measures in respect of which the Election Commission has sought amendment and the reaction of the Government thereto in order to resolve the difficulties, if any, and also to examine as to whether there is any interest at all in the implementation of the judgment noted herein above. However, details have been submitted by the Election Commission of Pakistan but the learned counsel is directed that he should obtain further instructions from by the Election Commission. 6. Learned counsel appearing for the Election Commission is directed to bifurcate these details firstly showing the portion which is to be implemented in pursuance of the directions of this Court in the judgment noted herein above, and CMA.64/2013, ete. 6 for which no legislation is called for. Secondly with a separate portion in respect of those directions, observations and improvements that the Election Commission on its own intends to achieve the objective under Article 218 3 of the Constitution, so that the matter could be resolved. This exercise must be carried out as early as possible. On receipt of the reply and after hearing the parties counsel further appropriate orders shall be passed in this behalf, as the general elections are around the corner. Therefore, there should be no delay by any corner and they should do the needful as is required to be done under the Constitution and the law as early as could be possible in the greater national interest. 7.

Details of the compliance of observations/directions\ncontained in the judgment reported as Workers’ Party\nPakistan through Akhtar Hussain and 6 others vv.\n\n\nCMA No. 64 of 2013 in Const.P.No.87 of 2011 -2-\n\nFederation of Pakistan and 2 others (PLD 2012 SC 681),\nwhich were to be implemented without promulgation or\namendment in the Representation of the People Act, 1976,\n(ROPA).\n\nli. And details of those directions which were to be\nimplemented through legislation.\n\n2. On behalf of the Federation, the learned Attorney\nGeneral for Pakistan has appeared and _ stated that the\nGovernment of Pakistan (GOP) got examined the proposed\namendments through Law Ministry and in the meanwhile a\nSpecial Committee of the Senate was also constituted and on the\nbasis of the same coupled with the observations made by the Law\nMinistry, draft of the proposed amendments was sent back to the\nECP for further action and according to his instructions reply of\nthe same has not been received so far.\n\nOn our query, learned counsel for ECP stated that he has no\ninstructions and after contacting the Commission, he would be in\na position to react in this behalf.\n\n3. The learned Attorney General also informed that in all\nfairness perhaps it would not be now possible for the Parliament\nto legislate the law as it was desired by the ECP because on 15™\nMarch, 2013, the Parliament is going to complete its term of five\nyears under Article 55 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic\nof Pakistan, 1973, but if need be, subsequent thereto by adhering\n\nto the process of legislation in terms of Article 89 of the\n\nCMA No. 64 of 2013 in Const.P.No.87 of 2011 -3-\n\nConstitution, needful can conveniently be done through issuance\nof an Ordinance.\n\n4. Learned counsel for the ECP stated that in view of\nvarious provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1976\n(ROPA) some of which have been read in the Court i.e. Section 70\nonward covering the definition of corrupt practices etc., and\ndirections & observations made in the case of Workers’ Party\nPakistan (supra) etc., ECP is of the opinion that it is equipped\nwith sufficient powers under the Constitution to arrange/organize\nfree and fair elections. However, if ECP decided to take up any\nissue requiring legislation, a request shall be sent to the\nconcerned authority for approaching the President of Pakistan to\nissue the Ordinance.\n\n5. Thus, it is observed that in view of the importance of\nthe issue of holding general elections in the country, if need be,\nthe President of Pakistan in accordance with the Constitution is\nalways competent to issue Ordinance to meet the requirement\nand to fulfil the objects and purposes, for which it is to be\npromulgated and there should not be any difficulty either for the\nECP or the Competent Authority to act in accordance with the\n\nConstitution.\n\nCMA No. 64 of 2013 in Const.P.No.87 of 2011 -4-\n\n6. The ECP has also placed on record nomination paper,\nwhich has been prepared by it, for the forthcoming elections of\nthe National and Provincial Assemblies.\n\n7. We have gone through it with the assistance of learned\ncounsel for parties.\n\n8. Learned Attorney General has stated that under Section\n107 of the ROPA, a request was sent by ECP for the amendment\nof Rule 3 of the Representation of the People (Conduct of\nElection) Rules, 1977, but the President of Pakistan so far has not\napproved the amendments, therefore, without adhering to the\nrules, the Election Commission may have not got printed\nnomination papers as GOP had reservations on some of its\nportions like ‘as what is the necessity to seek information about a\nperson with regards to his involvement in any criminal case in the\nlast six months etc. because a person cannot be disqualified\nunless he has been convicted and sentenced for the commission\nof offence, if committed by him’. In the same manner the\nrequirement of disclosing information about the travelling of a\ncandidate outside the country, etc. are unnecessary.\n\n9. The argument so raised by the learned Attorney\nGeneral has been opposed by learned counsel for the ECP. He\nhas contended that the Election Commission has to arrange/\n\norganize free, fair and honest elections and also to guard against\n\nCMA No. 64 of 2013 in Const.P.No.87 of 2011 -5-\n\nthe corruption in terms of Article 218(3) of the Constitution.\nTherefore, when a candidate who presents himself before the\nelectors, they are entitled to know about his full credentials and\nissuance of such nomination papers is not beyond the scope of\nthe Constitution and law.\n\n10. Mr. Hamid Khan, learned Sr. ASC appearing for one of\nthe political parities, i.e. PTI stated that there was no necessity\nfor seeking amendment of Rule 3 of the Representation of the\nPeople (Conduct of Election) Rules, 1977, as the proforma of the\nNomination Paper has been improved to gather further\ninformation with regard to a candidate to fulfil the object,\npurpose and command of the Constitution. He stated that besides\nArticle 218(3), Article 222 of the Constitution also empowers the\nCommission as according to it “subject to Constitution, no such\nlaw shall have the effect of taking away or abridging any of the\npowers of the Commissioner or an Election Commission under\nthis Part”. He has also referred to the residuary powers of the\nECP under Section 104 of the ROPA. He further stated that no one\namongst the present Parliamentarians or prospective candidates\nand the voters have come forward to raise objection on this\nproforma.\n\n11. Mr. Bilal Hassan Minto, learned counsel for the\n\npetitioner also supported the contentions of learned counsel for\n\nCMA No. 64 of 2013 in Const.P.No.87 of 2011 -6-\n\nthe ECP as well as Mr. Hamid Khan, learned Sr. ASC and also\nrelied upon relevant Section 103(c) of the ROPA, which deals with\nthe powers of the Commission to ensure fair elections.\n\n12. This Court in the case of Workers’ Party Pakistan vide\n\norder dated 28.03.2012 directed that any of the respondents or\nany other political party, which is interested to join the\nproceedings, may appear and file their concise statements\nwithout seeking any formal permission from the Court and in\nresponse thereto some of the political parties entered appearance\nto assist the Court.\n\n13. The object and the purpose of pronouncement of the\n\njudgment in the case of Workers’ Party Pakistan, was to ensure\n\nthat elections are arranged and organized by the ECP strictly\nunder Article 218(3) of the Constitution. For convenience the\nsame is reproduced herein below:\n\n\"218(3) It shall be the duty of the Election Commission to\norganize and conduct the election and to make such\narrangements as are necessary to ensure that the\nelection is conducted honestly, justly, fairly and in\naccordance with law, and that corrupt practices are\nguarded against.”\n\n14. The observations and the directions were made in the\nsaid case keeping in view the above provisions of the Constitution\nand the law. Expressions ‘fairly’, ‘justly’ and ‘honestly’ used\ntherein were elaborately interpreted. Neither the learned counsel,\n\nwho appeared to assist the Court nor anyone else subsequent\n\nCMA No. 64 of 2013 in Const.P.No.87 of 2011 -7-\n\nthereto, either representing any political party or the general\npublic had objected on the judgment by seeking its review.\n\n15. Now the ECP has made some additions in the\nnomination forms following command of Constitution under\nArticle 218(3) as well as keeping in view observations/directions\n\nin Workers party’s case. A copy of the same has been placed on\n\nrecord. It is not possible to reproduce the contents of the same,\nhowever, for sake of convenience the contents of the Nomination\nPaper shall be read as a part of this Order.\n\n16. Mr. Hamid Khan, learned Sr. ASC for PTI stated that\nthe contents of Nomination Paper are in the knowledge of all\nstakeholders i.e. electors, prospective candidates as well as the\nincumbent Parliamentarians and no objection on it has been\nraised by any one of them. The learned Attorney General for\nPakistan at this stage stated that the GOP itself is a supporter for\nholding free and fair general elections in the country but subject\nto law, and Government has also not expressed any objection but\nsome observations were made. It was the ECP, which had itself\napproached the President of Pakistan for amendment of the Rules\nand has now decided to print the nomination papers without his\ndecision. The learned counsel for the ECP stated that after having\ngiven second thought as he has already stated in his arguments it\n\nwas decided not to press for amendment of Rule 3 of ROPA,\n\nCMA No. 64 of 2013 in Const.P.No.87 of 2011 -8-\n\n1976. Therefore, nomination papers were printed and made\navailable for the information of all concerned including interested\npersons, who are likely to contest elections, so he/they should\nhave information of its particulars, which are required to be\nfurnished at the time of filing the nomination paper.\n\n17. In our order dated 12.03.2013, we had already made it\nclear that the ECP is required to perform its functions strictly in\naccordance with the Constitution. For sake of convenience,\n\nrelevant paras from the judgment of Workers’ party were\n\nreproduced. No doubt the ECP has a Constitutional commitment\nand obligation to arrange and organize elections according to\nArticle 218(3) and it also enjoys powers to do so as it has been\ndescribed under Article 222 of the Constitution. Under the\nconstitutional provision, ECP is responsible to arrange, organize\nand conduct elections honestly, justly, fairly and in according with\nlaw and emphasis is that corrupt practices should be guarded\nagainst. Thus, in view of such provision of Constitution a solemn\nobject should be that no corrupt person is allowed to enter in\nParliament. With this commitment of the Constitution, the ECP\nwithout changing the complexion or contents of Rule 3 of the\nRules, 1977, has made improvements in the proforma, already\nappended with the ROPA. There is no hard and fast rule to make\n\nimprovement in a proforma of nomination paper, particularly\n\nCMA No. 64 of 2013 in Const.P.No.87 of 2011 -9-\n\nwhen required object is to enforce Article 218(3) of the\nConstitution. A detailed information about a candidate is essential\nto be obtained as on his success he has to represent a\nconstituency on behalf of more than hundred thousands electors,\nfor a period of five years and on winning the election he shall be a\nmost responsible person along with others who will govern the\ncountry. It is the mandate of the Constitution that the people of\nPakistan shall be governed by the Chosen Representatives,\ntherefore, a candidate who comes forward for election, is supposed\nto provide his complete credentials to the voters enabling them to\ncaste votes in favour of such person who is honest and believes in\nfairness and is free from any disqualification under Article 63 of\nthe Constitution and is also qualified under Article 62 of the\nConstitution. Mr. Hamid Khan, Sr. ASC has stated that no one has\nraised objection to the contents of nomination papers. We agree\nwith him and believe that GOP is also of the opinion that there\nmust be free, fair and honest elections as well as free from any\ncorruption. Therefore, when all the stakeholders i.e. the ruling\nparty and the other political parties, voters, whose number is\nabout eight crore and the Nation as a whole is expecting that\ntheir representation in the Parliament should be made by honest\nperson(s) who are not polluted by allegation of corruption in any\n\nmanner. Thus, it is declared that ECP in compliance of Article\n\nCMA No. 64 of 2013 in Const.P.No.87 of 2011 -10-\n\n218(3) read with Article 222 of the Constitution and sections 103\n& 104 of Representation of Peoples Act, 1976 as well as the\n\njudgment in the case of Workers’ Party Pakistan (supra) has\n\nprepared/improved nomination papers for the forthcoming\nGeneral Elections of Pakistan for National and _ Provincial\nAssemblies, in accordance with the Constitution and the law.\n\n18. As far as the other amendments are concerned, if any,\n\nthe ECP may point out to the Court on the next date of hearing.\n\n19. Adjourned to 15™ March, 2013.\nChief Justice\nJudge\nIslamabad\n14.03.2013 Judge\n\nAPPROVED FOR REPORTING", "CleanedText": "ORDER Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, CJ. In continuation of our order dated 13.03.2013, the Election Commission of Pakistan ECP and the learned DAG were required to submit as under: i. Details of the compliance of observations/directions contained in the judgment reported as Workers Party Pakistan through Akhtar Hussain and 6 others vv. CMA No. 64 of 2013 in Const.P.No.87 of 2011 -2Federation of Pakistan and 2 others PLD 2012 SC 681 , which were to be implemented without promulgation or amendment in the Representation of the People Act, 1976, ROPA . li. And details of those directions which were to be implemented through legislation. 2. On behalf of the Federation, the learned Attorney General for Pakistan has appeared and stated that the Government of Pakistan GOP got examined the proposed amendments through Law Ministry and in the meanwhile a Special Committee of the Senate was also constituted and on the basis of the same coupled with the observations made by the Law Ministry, draft of the proposed amendments was sent back to the ECP for further action and according to his instructions reply of the same has not been received so far. On our query, learned counsel for ECP stated that he has no instructions and after contacting the Commission, he would be in a position to react in this behalf. 3. The learned Attorney General also informed that in all fairness perhaps it would not be now possible for the Parliament to legislate the law as it was desired by the ECP because on 15 March, 2013, the Parliament is going to complete its term of five years under Article 55 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, but if need be, subsequent thereto by adhering to the process of legislation in terms of Article 89 of the CMA No. 64 of 2013 in Const.P.No.87 of 2011 -3Constitution, needful can conveniently be done through issuance of an Ordinance. 4. Learned counsel for the ECP stated that in view of various provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1976 ROPA some of which have been read in the Court i.e. Section 70 onward covering the definition of corrupt practices etc., and directions observations made in the case of Workers Party Pakistan supra etc., ECP is of the opinion that it is equipped with sufficient powers under the Constitution to arrange/organize free and fair elections. However, if ECP decided to take up any issue requiring legislation, a request shall be sent to the concerned authority for approaching the President of Pakistan to issue the Ordinance. 5. Thus, it is observed that in view of the importance of the issue of holding general elections in the country, if need be, the President of Pakistan in accordance with the Constitution is always competent to issue Ordinance to meet the requirement and to fulfil the objects and purposes, for which it is to be promulgated and there should not be any difficulty either for the ECP or the Competent Authority to act in accordance with the Constitution. CMA No. 64 of 2013 in Const.P.No.87 of 2011 -46. The ECP has also placed on record nomination paper, which has been prepared by it, for the forthcoming elections of the National and Provincial Assemblies. 7. We have gone through it with the assistance of learned counsel for parties. 8. Learned Attorney General has stated that under Section 107 of the ROPA, a request was sent by ECP for the amendment of Rule 3 of the Representation of the People Conduct of Election Rules, 1977, but the President of Pakistan so far has not approved the amendments, therefore, without adhering to the rules, the Election Commission may have not got printed nomination papers as GOP had reservations on some of its portions like as what is the necessity to seek information about a person with regards to his involvement in any criminal case in the last six months etc. because a person cannot be disqualified unless he has been convicted and sentenced for the commission of offence, if committed by him . In the same manner the requirement of disclosing information about the travelling of a candidate outside the country, etc. are unnecessary. 9. The argument so raised by the learned Attorney General has been opposed by learned counsel for the ECP. He has contended that the Election Commission has to arrange/ organize free, fair and honest elections and also to guard against CMA No. 64 of 2013 in Const.P.No.87 of 2011 -5the corruption in terms of Article 218 3 of the Constitution. Therefore, when a candidate who presents himself before the electors, they are entitled to know about his full credentials and issuance of such nomination papers is not beyond the scope of the Constitution and law. 10. Mr. Hamid Khan, learned Sr. ASC appearing for one of the political parities, i.e. PTI stated that there was no necessity for seeking amendment of Rule 3 of the Representation of the People Conduct of Election Rules, 1977, as the proforma of the Nomination Paper has been improved to gather further information with regard to a candidate to fulfil the object, purpose and command of the Constitution. He stated that besides Article 218 3 , Article 222 of the Constitution also empowers the Commission as according to it subject to Constitution, no such law shall have the effect of taking away or abridging any of the powers of the Commissioner or an Election Commission under this Part . He has also referred to the residuary powers of the ECP under Section 104 of the ROPA. He further stated that no one amongst the present Parliamentarians or prospective candidates and the voters have come forward to raise objection on this proforma. 11. Mr. Bilal Hassan Minto, learned counsel for the petitioner also supported the contentions of learned counsel for CMA No. 64 of 2013 in Const.P.No.87 of 2011 -6the ECP as well as Mr. Hamid Khan, learned Sr. ASC and also relied upon relevant Section 103 c of the ROPA, which deals with the powers of the Commission to ensure fair elections. 12. This Court in the case of Workers Party Pakistan vide order dated 28.03.2012 directed that any of the respondents or any other political party, which is interested to join the proceedings, may appear and file their concise statements without seeking any formal permission from the Court and in response thereto some of the political parties entered appearance to assist the Court. 13. The object and the purpose of pronouncement of the judgment in the case of Workers Party Pakistan, was to ensure that elections are arranged and organized by the ECP strictly under Article 218 3 of the Constitution. For convenience the same is reproduced herein below: 218 3 It shall be the duty of the Election Commission to organize and conduct the election and to make such arrangements as are necessary to ensure that the election is conducted honestly, justly, fairly and in accordance with law, and that corrupt practices are guarded against. 14.

D.G (L)\nDate of Hearing : 26.03.2013.\nORDER\n\nIn response to order of this Court, dated 25.03.2013, the\nSecretary, Election Commission of Pakistan has appeared and filed a\n\ncomprehensive report (CMA No.1557 of 2013) and stated that the\n\nCMA No.1535-2013 etc -2-\n\nElection Commission of Pakistan (hereinafter referred to as “the ECP”)\nhas already undertaken an exercise to verify the Educational\nTestimonials of 1170 elected Representatives i.e. Members of the\nNational and Provincial Assemblies as well as the Senate, who\nparticipated in the General Elections in the year 2008 and the Election\nof the Senate subsequent thereto. Except in 69 cases the Educational\nTestimonials of all of them were authenticated to be correct by the\nHigher Education Commission. He further stated that the ECP itself\nexamined the cases which were not authenticated and concluded that\nthe Educational Testimonials of 27 of such Representatives suffer from\nno deficiency. However, out of the remaining 34 cases, references were\nmade to the respective DPOs and the Courts and except for two cases,\none by the Sessions Judge at Dera Alllahyar and the other by the\nSessions Judge Dera Ismail Khan, rest of the cases have not been\ndecided and he needs some time to collect information about the\nprogress in the remaining cases, which shall be done within a period of\ntwo days. Request so made by him is allowed.\n\nIn the meanwhile, a letter be sent to all the Registrars of the\nrespective Provincial High Courts and the Islamabad High Court, to\ncollect and furnish details from the Sessions Judges about pendency of\nsuch cases with reasons as to why the same have not been disposed of\nso far.\n\n2. The Secretary, ECP further stated that for the current\n\nprocess of the General Elections, which has been scheduled for\n\nCMA No.1535-2013 etc -3-\n\n11.5.2013, the Higher Education Commission has also been involved to\nattest the Educational Testimonials of the candidates to ensure that no\ncandidate who on his own has disclosed his educational qualification\nmay rely on Educational Testimonials, which are fake because it is the\nduty of the ECP under the command of the Constitution in terms of\nArticle 218 (3) to organize/conduct honest, free and fair elections. We\nhave pointed out to him that it is not necessary that all the prospective\ncandidates intending to participate in the General Elections are holders\nof the Degrees from the Universities because there would be\ncandidates, who claim to be holder of a Sanad of Deeni Madaras, such\nSanads have to be verified by the Institution known as Wafaq-\nTanzeem-ul-Madaras, which grants recognition to Deeni Madrissas and\nas far as Matriculation or Intermediate Certificates are concerned, the\nGovernment of Pakistan under Section 3 of the Federal Supervision of\nthe Curricula Textbooks and Maintenance of Standards of Education\nAct, 1976 read with Notification No.D.773/76-JEA,(CW), dated\n04.12.1976, has constituted the Inter Board Committee of Chairman\n(IBCC), which is the Competent Authority for determining of\nequivalence of the Certificates/Diplomas upto Higher Secondary level\nand as far as the Matriculate or Intermediate Certificates are concerned,\nthose are to be attested by the respective Boards functioning in the\nProvinces and Federation respectively.\n\n3. Needless to observe that as far as the Higher Education\n\nCommission (HEC) is concerned, it would be its duty to verify or attest\n\nCMA No.1535-2013 etc -4-\n\nthe Educational Testimonials of the Universities and all institutions of\nHigher Education. However, it would be appreciated if a mechanism is\nadopted by the ECP, enabling the HEC to supervise the\nscrutiny/examination of the Educational Testimonials of the candidates\nwithout wasting time and making reference to different institutions, the\nHEC may adopt an effective procedure on the basis of which, the ECP\nwithout loss of time may get correct information about the authenticity\nof the Educational Testimonials.\n\n4. It is to be noted that under Section 14 of the Representation\nof the People Act, 1976, an elector has also right to raise objections to\nthe nomination of a candidate, relevant provision therefrom are\nreproduced herein below:\n\n14(1) The candidates, their election agents, [the proposers\nand seconders and one other person authorized in this\nbehalf by each candidate][and an elector who has filed an\nobjection to the nomination of a candidate,]may attend the\nscrutiny of nomination papers, and the Returning Officer\nshall give them reasonable opportunity for examining all\nnomination papers delivered to him under section 12.\n[Provided that an elector who has filed an objection\nto the nomination of candidate shall only attend the scrutiny\n\nof the nomination paper of that candidate. ]\n\n“14 (5) A candidate, may prefer an appeal against the\ndecision of the Returning Officer rejecting or, as the case\nmay be, accepting the nomination paper of the candidate to\nthe Tribunal constituted for the constituency to which the\n\nnomination relates and consisting of not less than two nor\n\nCMA No.1535-2013 etc -5-\n\nmore than three Judges of the High Court nominated by the\nCommissioner, with the approval of the President; and such\nappeal shall be summarily decided within such time as may\nbe notified by the Commission and any other passed thereon\nshall be final.\n\n14(5A) If on the basis of any information or material\nbrought to its knowledge by any source, a Tribunal\nconstituted under sub-section (5) is of the opinion that a\ncandidate whose nomination papers have been accepted is a\ndefaulter of loan, taxes government dues or utility charges\nor has had any loan written off or suffers from another\ndisqualification from being elected as a member of an\nAssembly, it may, on its own motion, call upon such\ncandidate to show cause why his nomination papers may not\nbe rejected, and if the Tribunal is satisfied that the\ncandidate is actually a defaulter as aforesaid or has had a\nloan written off or suffers from any disqualification, it may\n\nreject the nomination papers.”\n\n5. Undoubtedly, a citizen, who is also an elector or voter, has\na right to have access to the information in all manners with reference\nto credentials, antecedents etc of a candidate for whom he is going to\nvote for electing him as his representative, therefore, in terms of Article\n19-A of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, it is\nthe Fundamental Right of a citizen to have access to information about\nthe candidate for whom elector/voter may cast his vote.

Except in 69 cases the Educational Testimonials of all of them were authenticated to be correct by the Higher Education Commission. He further stated that the ECP itself examined the cases which were not authenticated and concluded that the Educational Testimonials of 27 of such Representatives suffer from no deficiency. However, out of the remaining 34 cases, references were made to the respective DPOs and the Courts and except for two cases, one by the Sessions Judge at Dera Alllahyar and the other by the Sessions Judge Dera Ismail Khan, rest of the cases have not been decided and he needs some time to collect information about the progress in the remaining cases, which shall be done within a period of two days. Request so made by him is allowed. In the meanwhile, a letter be sent to all the Registrars of the respective Provincial High Courts and the Islamabad High Court, to collect and furnish details from the Sessions Judges about pendency of such cases with reasons as to why the same have not been disposed of so far. 2. The Secretary, ECP further stated that for the current process of the General Elections, which has been scheduled for CMA No.1535-2013 etc -311.5.2013, the Higher Education Commission has also been involved to attest the Educational Testimonials of the candidates to ensure that no candidate who on his own has disclosed his educational qualification may rely on Educational Testimonials, which are fake because it is the duty of the ECP under the command of the Constitution in terms of Article 218 3 to organize/conduct honest, free and fair elections. We have pointed out to him that it is not necessary that all the prospective candidates intending to participate in the General Elections are holders of the Degrees from the Universities because there would be candidates, who claim to be holder of a Sanad of Deeni Madaras, such Sanads have to be verified by the Institution known as WafaqTanzeem-ul-Madaras, which grants recognition to Deeni Madrissas and as far as Matriculation or Intermediate Certificates are concerned, the Government of Pakistan under Section 3 of the Federal Supervision of the Curricula Textbooks and Maintenance of Standards of Education Act, 1976 read with Notification No.D.773/76-JEA, CW , dated 04.12.1976, has constituted the Inter Board Committee of Chairman IBCC , which is the Competent Authority for determining of equivalence of the Certificates/Diplomas upto Higher Secondary level and as far as the Matriculate or Intermediate Certificates are concerned, those are to be attested by the respective Boards functioning in the Provinces and Federation respectively. 3. Needless to observe that as far as the Higher Education Commission HEC is concerned, it would be its duty to verify or attest CMA No.1535-2013 etc -4the Educational Testimonials of the Universities and all institutions of Higher Education. However, it would be appreciated if a mechanism is adopted by the ECP, enabling the HEC to supervise the scrutiny/examination of the Educational Testimonials of the candidates without wasting time and making reference to different institutions, the HEC may adopt an effective procedure on the basis of which, the ECP without loss of time may get correct information about the authenticity of the Educational Testimonials. 4. It is to be noted that under Section 14 of the Representation of the People Act, 1976, an elector has also right to raise objections to the nomination of a candidate, relevant provision therefrom are reproduced herein below: 14 1 The candidates, their election agents, the proposers and seconders and one other person authorized in this behalf by each candidate and an elector who has filed an objection to the nomination of a candidate, may attend the scrutiny of nomination papers, and the Returning Officer shall give them reasonable opportunity for examining all nomination papers delivered to him under section 12. Provided that an elector who has filed an objection to the nomination of candidate shall only attend the scrutiny of the nomination paper of that candidate. 14 5 A candidate, may prefer an appeal against the decision of the Returning Officer rejecting or, as the case may be, accepting the nomination paper of the candidate to the Tribunal constituted for the constituency to which the nomination relates and consisting of not less than two nor CMA No.1535-2013 etc -5more than three Judges of the High Court nominated by the Commissioner, with the approval of the President; and such appeal shall be summarily decided within such time as may be notified by the Commission and any other passed thereon shall be final. 14 5A If on the basis of any information or material brought to its knowledge by any source, a Tribunal constituted under sub-section 5 is of the opinion that a candidate whose nomination papers have been accepted is a defaulter of loan, taxes government dues or utility charges or has had any loan written off or suffers from another disqualification from being elected as a member of an Assembly, it may, on its own motion, call upon such candidate to show cause why his nomination papers may not be rejected, and if the Tribunal is satisfied that the candidate is actually a defaulter as aforesaid or has had a loan written off or suffers from any disqualification, it may reject the nomination papers. 5. Undoubtedly, a citizen, who is also an elector or voter, has a right to have access to the information in all manners with reference to credentials, antecedents etc of a candidate for whom he is going to vote for electing him as his representative, therefore, in terms of Article 19-A of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, it is the Fundamental Right of a citizen to have access to information about the candidate for whom elector/voter may cast his vote. When we inquired from the Secretary, ECP, he stated that it has been decided to place the nomination papers on the web-site, enabling the electors or the voters to obtain information and file objections in terms of the CMA No.1535-2013 etc -6above provisions of the law, which is to be read along with Article 19A of the Constitution but we have also asked him that besides making available the nomination papers on the web-site, a simple procedure should also be adopted, enabling the electors/voters, who intend to raise objections to obtain a copy of the nomination paper by making a request subject to payment of prescribed fee, etc. On this, he stated that in this behalf a mechanism and SOP shall be issued because the object and the purpose of the ECP is to adhere strictly to the legal provisions refereed to herein before and as well as Article 218 3 of the Constitution. 6.

Khawaja\nMr. Justice Khilji Arif Hussain\nMr. Justice Amir Hani Muslim\nMr. Justice Ejaz Afzal Khan\n\nCMA No.16522013 in SMC No.16 of 2011\n\nOn Court’s Notice: Mr. Qasim Mir Jat, Addl. A.G. Sindh\nMr. Zafar Abbas Bokhari, DIG (West), Karachi\nMr. Amir Farooqi, SSP (Central), Karachi.\nDate of Hearing: 29.03.2013\nORDER\n\nIftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, CJ. The Daily EXPRESS TRIBUNE published a\n\nstory on March, 23\"4, 2013 under caption “WHERE LAW ENFORCERS FEAR TO TREAD:\nTHE ENTRY FEE FOR THESE SPOTS OF KARACHI MAY BE YOUR LIFE”. The publisher\nhad also appended a sketch; contents whereof have shown “NO-GO AREAS ONLY FOR A\nPARTICULAR ETHNICITY IN TIMES OF ETHNIC VIOLENCE” AND “COMPLETE NO-GO\nAREAS BECAUSE OF THE PRESENCE OF MILITANTS OR GANGSTERS”. The report and\nthe sketch are hereby made part of the instant proceedings and instead of making reference\n\nof its contents it is considered appropriate to reproduce the same in extenso.\n\n“Shortly after the armed forces launched the Kalosha II operation in South\nWaziristan back in 2004, the crocodiles lazing in the murky natural pond in\nManghopir got new neighbours. Suddenly, they weren’t the most dangerous\nresidents of the area.\n\nEmbedded in the increased influx of Mehsud tribesmen coming to Karachi were\nmilitants who settled in Pakhtun-dominated areas of the city, attempting to blend in\nunnoticed. They would soon go on to disrupt the life of the city’s residents —\nincluding the crocodiles at Hazrat Khawaja Hassan’s shrine, which was closed for\nover a month following the bomb attack in 2010 on Abdullah Shah Ghazi's shrine.\n\n“First, the hunters — the law enforcers — used to only get hurt when they dared to put\ntheir hands in the den of the lions, the militants. Now it seems as if the lions have\ncome out of the den and are stalking the hunters themselves,”” DSP Qamar Ahmed\ntold The Express Tribune.\n\nThe militants, including Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) members, now have an\niron grip over parts of the city, including Sohrab Goth, Manghopir and Ittehad\nTown. Over the years, they made increasingly brazen attacks, including one on\nSohrab Goth police station on January 29 this year\n\nFirst, the hunters — the law enforcers — used to only get\nhurt when they dared to put their hands in the den of\nthe lions, the militants. Now it seems as if the lions have\n\ncome out of the den and are stalking the hunters\nthemselves\nDSP Qamar Ahmed\n\nSHO Ashfaq Baloch of the Manghopir police station admits that it is difficult to\nimpose the writ of the state in his jurisdiction and that standard operating\nprocedures followed by law enforcers elsewhere in the city have to be bent — very\ndrastically.\n\n“When a killing occurs somewhere else in the city, a lone constable usually hops\nonto a motorcycle and speeds off to the scene of the crime. Here, we can’t think of\ndoing that unless we have a death wish,” he said. “We have to make sure our\nweapons are loaded.

The Daily EXPRESS TRIBUNE published a story on March, 23 4, 2013 under caption WHERE LAW ENFORCERS FEAR TO TREAD: THE ENTRY FEE FOR THESE SPOTS OF KARACHI MAY BE YOUR LIFE . The publisher had also appended a sketch; contents whereof have shown NO-GO AREAS ONLY FOR A PARTICULAR ETHNICITY IN TIMES OF ETHNIC VIOLENCE AND COMPLETE NO-GO AREAS BECAUSE OF THE PRESENCE OF MILITANTS OR GANGSTERS . The report and the sketch are hereby made part of the instant proceedings and instead of making reference of its contents it is considered appropriate to reproduce the same in extenso. Shortly after the armed forces launched the Kalosha II operation in South Waziristan back in 2004, the crocodiles lazing in the murky natural pond in Manghopir got new neighbours. Suddenly, they weren t the most dangerous residents of the area. Embedded in the increased influx of Mehsud tribesmen coming to Karachi were militants who settled in Pakhtun-dominated areas of the city, attempting to blend in unnoticed. They would soon go on to disrupt the life of the city s residents including the crocodiles at Hazrat Khawaja Hassan s shrine, which was closed for over a month following the bomb attack in 2010 on Abdullah Shah Ghazi s shrine. First, the hunters the law enforcers used to only get hurt when they dared to put their hands in the den of the lions, the militants. Now it seems as if the lions have come out of the den and are stalking the hunters themselves, DSP Qamar Ahmed told The Express Tribune. The militants, including Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan TTP members, now have an iron grip over parts of the city, including Sohrab Goth, Manghopir and Ittehad Town. Over the years, they made increasingly brazen attacks, including one on Sohrab Goth police station on January 29 this year First, the hunters the law enforcers used to only get hurt when they dared to put their hands in the den of the lions, the militants. Now it seems as if the lions have come out of the den and are stalking the hunters themselves DSP Qamar Ahmed SHO Ashfaq Baloch of the Manghopir police station admits that it is difficult to impose the writ of the state in his jurisdiction and that standard operating procedures followed by law enforcers elsewhere in the city have to be bent very drastically. When a killing occurs somewhere else in the city, a lone constable usually hops onto a motorcycle and speeds off to the scene of the crime. Here, we can t think of doing that unless we have a death wish, he said. We have to make sure our weapons are loaded. Then an entire team, headed by me, gets into a police mobile. Only when we pacify the criminals that we haven t come to apprehend them can we advance safely to retrieve the body. SHO Baloch added that he prefers not to send the officers on duty to pick up a body. We often wait for a body to turn up at one of the hospitals and then head there to question the family and any eyewitnesses. What about raids and patrols in the area? SHO Baloch shakes his head. DSP Ahmed s statement seems to suggest that no-go areas in the city will grow organically like cancer. Should we fear that criminals want all-out anarchy where the law of the jungle is followed all over the city? SSP Amir Faroogi, who heads the police s Orangi division, doesn t think so.

Secy (Exp)\nDate of Hearing : 19.04.2013\nORDER\n\nIFTIKHAR MUHAMMAD CHAUDHRY, CJ.—The Secretary,\n\nCabinet Division, Government of Pakistan, filed the requisite\nreply (CMA No.2222 of 2013) in pursuance of the earlier order\ndated 16.04.2013. She has explained the procedure of\nallocating the funds by the Prime Minister from Peoples Works\nProgramme-II (PWP-II). However, she stated that according to\nthe budgetary provisions, an amount of Rs.22 billion (annual)\nwas made available to the Prime Minister with an authority to\nsanction the amount in favour of the Parliamentarians and\nNotables for the development programmes. She further stated\nthat being the Cabinet Secretary, she is not aware about the\ncriteria/preferences of the Prime Minister for making allocation\nto different development schemes, as this subject is assigned\n\nto the Special Secretary of the Prime Minister and no sooner a\n\nConst.P.No.20 of 2013 2\n\nsanction letter is issued, the same is processed in the Cabinet\nDivision for onward transmission to the Accountant General\nPakistan Revenues (AGPR) and the concerned Executing\nAgency. Admittedly, there is no system in place for monitoring\nthe sanctioned funds. The AGPR is required to issue cheques\nto Executing Agency and then ultimately, it is only the\nExecuting Agency, which had to monitor the execution of the\ndevelopment schemes. For our perusal, besides offering\nexplanation about the expenditures of the PWP-II funds, a\ncopy of sanction letter as a sample has also been placed on\nrecord.\n\n2. Prima facie, it seems that at the initial stage of\nsanctioning the funds from the Peoples Works Programme, no\npreliminary formalities were carried out about the feasibility\netc. of the development programmes. It appears from the\nletter dated 15.04.2013, issued by Mr. Tahir Maqsood,\nAdditional Secretary (P-I), Prime Minister’s Secretariat\n(Public), and the list attached therewith that on the demand of\nthe Parliamentarians or the “Notables”, who somehow\nsucceeded in approaching the Prime Minister for allocation of\nthe funds for development from PWP, were obliged by making\nsanctions without following a transparent procedure nor the\nfeasibility of the scheme for which the funds have been\nsanctioned was considered inasmuch as according to the list\n\nwhich has been furnished, not only the worthy Members of the\n\nConst.P.No.20 of 2013 3\n\nParliament, the Members of the Provincial Assemblies, the\n“Notables” have succeeded in getting allocation of their\nschemes from the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is a\nperson who represents the Government and the citizens,\ntherefore, in sanctioning/allocating funds for the schemes, he\nis bound to follow the high standard of transparency. In doing\nso for the well-being of the general public and for this\npurpose, a system has to be institutionalized following the\nrecognized principles of exercising discretion judiciously. The\nPrime Minister, being elected representative, is required to\nfollow the procedure to prove equitable distribution of funds\nfor schemes without any discrimination in any manner. In the\ninstant case, what we have noticed as former Prime Minster,\nRaja Pervaiz Ashraf sanctioned for himself the following\n\namounts from time to time:-\n\nS.No. Dir Issue date Subject Beneficiary Amount Released /\nNo. Approved stuck Up\n13 0007 27.07.2012 Supply of gas to | Raja Pervaiz 200.000 Released\n\nvillages/localities in NA-51, | Ashraf, MNA,\nTehsil Gujjar Khan, District | NA-51, District\nRawalpindi.

Out of Rs.25 billion, Rs.15 billion are diverted funds\n\nfrom the PSDP originally allocated for Diamer Basha Dam,\n\nHigh Education Commission, Lowari Tunnel, FATA and Saving\n\nSchemes etc, (emphasis provided), whereas Rs.10 billion are\nthree supplementary grants (Rs.5 + Rs.3 + Rs.2 billion),\nsanctioned by the Finance Division. The Secretary, Cabinet\nDivision further stated that Rs.42.486 billion have already\nbeen released whereas balance amount of about Rs.4.5 billion\nis still available with the Cabinet Division. She informed that\nthere were certain sanctions were made by the former Prime\nMinister on completion of the tenure of the Government but\nshe declined and they were not processed.\n\n5. It may be noted that in pursuance of an article\npublished in the daily news “A/-Akhbar”, Islamabad, dated\n25.03.2013, under the caption (lies dy: cy S Ge Se lly it Ui pth\nan application was registered as HRC No.11504-G/2013, and\nthe Secretary Planning and Development Division has filed\n\ncomments by offering the following explanations: -\n\n\nConst.P.No.20 of 2013 6\n\n“Sub: REPORT IN HRC _NO.11504-G/2013-\nAPPLICATION: THE DAILY NEWS _ AL-\nAKHBAR, DATED __25'\" | MARCH, _2013,\nISLAMABAD (REGARDING CORRUPTION OF\nEX-GOVERNMENT\n\nThe daily Al-Akhbar has reported in the\neditorial of its publication of 25 March, 2013 that\nthe former Government in its last days has diverted\nRs.5 billion from important projects for the schemes\nof Members of National Assembly and powerful\nMinisters to facilitate their success in the\nforthcoming elections. The paper has reported that\nfunds have been diverted from Diamer Basha Dam,\nHigher Education Commission, Lowari Tunnel, FATA,\nSaving Schemes along with other important projects\nand a total of Rs.43 billion have been provided to\nthem (Annex-I)\n\n2. While the contents of the newspaper clipping\nare not specific, these appear to allude to\nallocations made for schemes under the Peoples\nWorks Programme-II. Allocation for Peoples Works\nProgramme-II (PWP-II) is kept in Public Sector\nDevelopment Programme (PSDP) as a_ block\nprovision in the Demand of Cabinet Division. Funds\nfrom the block provision are released by the Cabinet\nDivision on the directives of the Prime Minister\nissued by the Prime Minister’s Secretariat to the\nexecuting agencies for implementation — of\nschemes/projects directly without involvement of\nPlanning and Development Division. An allocation\nof Rs.22 billion was kept for PWP-II in the PSDP\n2012-13.\n\n3. On a request from the Prime Minister’s\nSecretariat, a summary was moved by the Finance\nDivision on 11° October, 2012, proposing provision\nof additional funds of Rs.10.00 billion for PWP-II\nduring fiscal year 2012-13. The proposal was\napproved by the then Prime Minister. Pursuant to\nthe approval of the Prime Minister, Finance Division\nadvised Planning and Development Division on 15\"\nOctober, 2012 for making necessary adjustments\nwithin the allocations of PSDP 2012-13 while\nensuring that the overall size of PSDP does not\nincrease beyond its existing size as a result of this\nsupplementary grant (Annex-II). Consequently, the\nPlanning and Development Division issued\nadjustments letters on 6\" November, 2012 and 23”\nNovember, 2012 to allocate Rs.5 billion each (Rs.10\nbillion) by diverting funds from other PSDP projects,\nwith the approval of the then Finance Minister\n(Annex-III, IV).\n\n4. The above adjustments included diversion\nfrom allocations to Diamer Basha Dam, Lowari\nTunnel, FATA & Higher Education Commission.\nHowever, on the request of Governor, Khyber\n\nConst.P.No.20 of 2013 7\n\nPakhtunkhwa, the amount of Rs.4 billion was\nsubsequently recouped to FATA by reducing the\nequivalent allocation of other PSDP projects on 27\"\nDecember, 2012 (Annex-V).\n\n5. The Finance Division, after having been\nconveyed verbal directions for approval of additional\nallocation of Rs.10 billion by the then Prime\nMinister, moved a summary on 24‘ December,\n2012 proposing another supplementary grant of\nRs.10 billion for PWP-II through internal adjustment\nin the PSDP 2012-13 by the Planning and\nDevelopment Division, which was approved by the\nthen Prime Minister. Planning and Development\nDivision carried out an exercise and adjusted Rs.5\nbillion only instead of Rs.10 billion, by reducing the\nallocations of other PSDP projects with the approval\nof the then Finance Minister (Annex-VI). As such a\ntotal Rs.15 billion was allocated to PWP-II through\nadjustments during the fiscal year 2012-13.\n\n6. In addition to above internal adjustments in\nthe PSDP 2012-13, Finance Division has also\napproved an additional allocation of Rs.10 billion for\nPWP-II through supplementary grant, over and\nabove the existing size of the PSDP 2012-13.\nResultantly, allocation for PWP-II increased from\nRs.22 billion to Rs.47 billion.”\n\n6. It is interesting to note that along with the report,\nan Office Memorandum of the Government of Pakistan,\nPlanning Commission, Planning and Development Division,\ndated 06.11.2012 is appended, under’ the _ subject\n“SUPPLEMENTARY GRANT FOR PEOPLES WORKS PROGRAMME-\nII (PWP-IIT) WITHIN THE EXISTING SIZE OF PSDP 2012-13”. It\nfinds mention in the letter that the Federal Minister for\nFinance, Revenue and Planning & Development has been\npleased to accord approval for the provision of additional funds\nof Rs.5.0 billion through adjustment in PSDP 2012-13,\nproposed by the Planning & Development Division, to divert it\nto PWP-II. The approved funds would be surrendered by the\n\nconcerned Ministries/Divisions in favour of Cabinet Division for\n\nConst.P.No.20 of 2013 8\n\nPWP-II. This document is available on the file of HRC\nNo.11504-G of 2013 as Annexure-II, which is hereby directed\nto be clubbed with the instant case. For convenience, the\nnames of the Ministries/Divisions, who were directed to divert\nthe funds in favour of the Cabinet Division for PWP-II, are\nnoted herein below: -\n\ni. States and Frontier Regions Division;\n\nii. Capital Administration and Development Division;\n\niii. Communication Division;\n\niv. Education & Training Division;\n\nVv. Finance Division;\n\nvi. | Higher Education Commission;\n\nvii. Interior Division;\n\nviii. Ministry of Narcotics Control;\n\nix. Railways Division; and\n\nx. Water & Power Division (Water Sector)\n7. It is true that there were savings as the\nMinistry/Division indicated in the above Memorandum but the\nquestion arises that instead of spending these amounts on any\nother Public Development Programme, the same have been\ndiverted in favour of the Cabinet Division for PWP-II for the\npurpose of allocating/distributing these funds to the\nParliamentarians and the “Notables” knowing fully well that\nbudgetary allocations of Rs.22 billion under this Head has\nalready been exhausted, therefore, prima facie inference could\nonly be drawn that the object and the purpose was the same\nas has been captioned in the news item of daily “A/-Akhbar”\nnoted herein above, particularly, knowing well that there is no\n\nmonitoring system in stricto senso to ensure the expenditure\n\nof PWP-II funds in a transparent manner. It is also to be noted\n\nConst.P.No.20 of 2013 9\n\nthat under the New System of Financial Control and Budgeting\nin order to maintain the financial disciplines, certain\ninstructions were issued from time to time to be followed\nincluding with regard to the power of sanctioning projects, etc.\n8. We have also issued notice to the Secretary Finance\nfor the purpose of answering the questions, which have been\nframed in the order dated 16.04.2013, and are reproduced\n\nherein below:-\n\ni. As to whether the funds belonging to public\nexchequer have been allocated/distributed to\nMNAs/MPAs/ Notables in accordance with the\nConstitution and the law?\n\nii. What is the phenomenon or procedure to\nmonitor the spending of amount and as to whether\nthe details of such developments are available?\n\niii. Whether the contracts were granted to the\ncontractors by following the PPRA Rules?\n\nNo reply has been filed except contending that in HRC\nNo.11504-G of 2013, reply was filed. The Finance Division is\ndirected to file the reply of the above forthwith.\n\n9. After having taken into consideration the above-\nnoted facts along with the viewpoint put forward by the\nSecretary, Cabinet Division, it is necessary to issue notice to\nthe Special Secretary to the Prime Minister to submit SOPs,\nTORs or any instructions on the basis of which the Prime\nMinster is persuaded to allocate funds from PWP-II and as to\nwhether there is any system in place for subjecting the\nschemes to technical scrutiny before allocating funds or it is\n\nleft for the Prime Minster to exercise his discretion, without\n\nConst.P.No.20 of 2013 10\n\nadhering to the Rules of Business and without sanction of the\nCabinet, the Prime Minister alone enjoys unfettered powers to\nmake allocations from the programmes on the request of the\npublic representatives, including the Members of the Provincial\nAssemblies and the “Notables” and if it is so what is the\njustification available with the Special Secretary or the Prime\nMinister to accommodate any person being a representative or\notherwise, etc.\n\n10. The Accountant General Pakistan Revenues, is\nhereby directed to put up the details in respect of each\ndevelopment scheme, which finds mention in the list appended\nwith letter dated 15.04.2013, copy of which shall also be\nsupplied to the AGPR along with the names of the Executing\nAgency to whom the amounts have been allocated for\nspending for the execution of the schemes. Similarly, each of\nthe Executing Agency in whose favour the cheques were\nissued, shall submit reply through the AGPR about feasibility\nof the scheme and also to disclose as to whether the PPRA\nRules were followed in order to ensure transparency in the\nexecution of the schemes and to what extent schemes have\nbeen executed alongwith details of funds so far utilized for\neach scheme separately.\n\n11. Apparently, it seems that funds were diverted from\nthe most important projects, like Diamer Basha Dam, Higher\n\nEducation Commission, Lowari Tunnel, FATA, Saving Schemes\n\nConst.P.No.20 of 2013 11\n\netc noted herein above to the tune of Rs.22 billion, which in\nfact should not have been so done because of the importance\nof those projects, which undoubtedly have national importance\nand if are completed, the same being in the interest of the\neconomic development of the country, ultimate benefit will\npass on to the whole Nation. The manner in which the Finance\nDivision and the Planning & Development Division had diverted\nthese funds to the Cabinet Division to increase the budgetary\nallocation to PWP-II from Rs.22 billion also seems to be non-\ntransparent because in such like situation, when an amount\nhas already been spent for the purpose, the preference should\nhave been given for completion of the projects of national\nimportance, instead of allocating this budget for execution of\nsmall schemes, which are meant only for the benefit of\nindividuals and not for the whole Nation.\n\n12. In view of the above, we direct the AGPR to ensure\nthat pending decision of the instant petition the funds which\nhave already been released to the Executing Agencies,\nincluding for the schemes enumerated in the list appended\nwith the letter dated 15.04.2013 referred to herein above are\nnot further distributed and the payments in respect of the\nschemes, details of which have been furnished by the Prime\nMinister’s Secretariat shall be stopped immediately and a\ncompliance report shall be sent to the Registrar of this Court\n\nby the AGPR for our perusal in Chamber within a period of\n\nConst.P.No.20 of 2013 12\n\nthree days, after receipt of this Order. Similarly, the Executing\nAgencies to whom the work has been assigned or the process\nof assigning of work is yet to be completed shall not proceed\nfurther with these schemes, till further orders passed by this\nCourt.\n\nSimilarly, notice to the Secretary, Planning &\nDevelopment Division, Government of Pakistan, be issued for\nfiling reply of the facts and consideration which have already\nbeen noted in the order dated 16.04.2013 as well as in the\ninstant order. Notice to the learned Attorney General for\n\nPakistan be also issued for the next date.\n\n13. Let this case be fixed on 30.04.2013.\nCJ.\nJ.\n\nIslamabad\n\n19.04.2013 J.", "CleanedText": "ORDER IFTIKHAR MUHAMMAD CHAUDHRY, CJ. The Secretary, Cabinet Division, Government of Pakistan, filed the requisite reply CMA No.2222 of 2013 in pursuance of the earlier order dated 16.04.2013. She has explained the procedure of allocating the funds by the Prime Minister from Peoples Works Programme-II PWP-II . However, she stated that according to the budgetary provisions, an amount of Rs.22 billion annual was made available to the Prime Minister with an authority to sanction the amount in favour of the Parliamentarians and Notables for the development programmes. She further stated that being the Cabinet Secretary, she is not aware about the criteria/preferences of the Prime Minister for making allocation to different development schemes, as this subject is assigned to the Special Secretary of the Prime Minister and no sooner a Const.P.No.20 of 2013 2 sanction letter is issued, the same is processed in the Cabinet Division for onward transmission to the Accountant General Pakistan Revenues AGPR and the concerned Executing Agency. Admittedly, there is no system in place for monitoring the sanctioned funds. The AGPR is required to issue cheques to Executing Agency and then ultimately, it is only the Executing Agency, which had to monitor the execution of the development schemes. For our perusal, besides offering explanation about the expenditures of the PWP-II funds, a copy of sanction letter as a sample has also been placed on record. 2. Prima facie, it seems that at the initial stage of sanctioning the funds from the Peoples Works Programme, no preliminary formalities were carried out about the feasibility etc. of the development programmes. It appears from the letter dated 15.04.2013, issued by Mr. Tahir Maqsood, Additional Secretary P-I , Prime Minister s Secretariat Public , and the list attached therewith that on the demand of the Parliamentarians or the Notables , who somehow succeeded in approaching the Prime Minister for allocation of the funds for development from PWP, were obliged by making sanctions without following a transparent procedure nor the feasibility of the scheme for which the funds have been sanctioned was considered inasmuch as according to the list which has been furnished, not only the worthy Members of the Const.P.No.20 of 2013 3 Parliament, the Members of the Provincial Assemblies, the Notables have succeeded in getting allocation of their schemes from the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is a person who represents the Government and the citizens, therefore, in sanctioning/allocating funds for the schemes, he is bound to follow the high standard of transparency. In doing so for the well-being of the general public and for this purpose, a system has to be institutionalized following the recognized principles of exercising discretion judiciously. The Prime Minister, being elected representative, is required to follow the procedure to prove equitable distribution of funds for schemes without any discrimination in any manner.

It is informed by the Additional Secretary, Finance Division that a further sum of Rs.25 billion were allowed to be expended over and above the budgetary allocation of Rs.22 billion. Out of Rs.25 billion, Rs.15 billion are diverted funds from the PSDP originally allocated for Diamer Basha Dam, High Education Commission, Lowari Tunnel, FATA and Saving Schemes etc, emphasis provided , whereas Rs.10 billion are three supplementary grants Rs.5 Rs.3 Rs.2 billion , sanctioned by the Finance Division. The Secretary, Cabinet Division further stated that Rs.42.486 billion have already been released whereas balance amount of about Rs.4.5 billion is still available with the Cabinet Division. She informed that there were certain sanctions were made by the former Prime Minister on completion of the tenure of the Government but she declined and they were not processed. 5. It may be noted that in pursuance of an article published in the daily news A/-Akhbar , Islamabad, dated 25.03.2013, under the caption lies dy: cy S Ge Se lly it Ui pth an application was registered as HRC No.11504-G/2013, and the Secretary Planning and Development Division has filed comments by offering the following explanations: - Const.P.No.20 of 2013 6 Sub: REPORT IN HRC NO.11504-G/2013APPLICATION: THE DAILY NEWS ALAKHBAR, DATED 25 MARCH, 2013, ISLAMABAD REGARDING CORRUPTION OF EX-GOVERNMENT The daily Al-Akhbar has reported in the editorial of its publication of 25 March, 2013 that the former Government in its last days has diverted Rs.5 billion from important projects for the schemes of Members of National Assembly and powerful Ministers to facilitate their success in the forthcoming elections. The paper has reported that funds have been diverted from Diamer Basha Dam, Higher Education Commission, Lowari Tunnel, FATA, Saving Schemes along with other important projects and a total of Rs.43 billion have been provided to them Annex-I 2. While the contents of the newspaper clipping are not specific, these appear to allude to allocations made for schemes under the Peoples Works Programme-II. Allocation for Peoples Works Programme-II PWP-II is kept in Public Sector Development Programme PSDP as a block provision in the Demand of Cabinet Division. Funds from the block provision are released by the Cabinet Division on the directives of the Prime Minister issued by the Prime Minister s Secretariat to the executing agencies for implementation of schemes/projects directly without involvement of Planning and Development Division. An allocation of Rs.22 billion was kept for PWP-II in the PSDP 2012-13. 3. On a request from the Prime Minister s Secretariat, a summary was moved by the Finance Division on 11 October, 2012, proposing provision of additional funds of Rs.10.00 billion for PWP-II during fiscal year 2012-13. The proposal was approved by the then Prime Minister. Pursuant to the approval of the Prime Minister, Finance Division advised Planning and Development Division on 15 October, 2012 for making necessary adjustments within the allocations of PSDP 2012-13 while ensuring that the overall size of PSDP does not increase beyond its existing size as a result of this supplementary grant Annex-II . Consequently, the Planning and Development Division issued adjustments letters on 6 November, 2012 and 23 November, 2012 to allocate Rs.5 billion each Rs.10 billion by diverting funds from other PSDP projects, with the approval of the then Finance Minister Annex-III, IV . 4. The above adjustments included diversion from allocations to Diamer Basha Dam, Lowari Tunnel, FATA Higher Education Commission. However, on the request of Governor, Khyber Const.P.No.20 of 2013 7 Pakhtunkhwa, the amount of Rs.4 billion was subsequently recouped to FATA by reducing the equivalent allocation of other PSDP projects on 27 December, 2012 Annex-V . 5. The Finance Division, after having been conveyed verbal directions for approval of additional allocation of Rs.10 billion by the then Prime Minister, moved a summary on 24 December, 2012 proposing another supplementary grant of Rs.10 billion for PWP-II through internal adjustment in the PSDP 2012-13 by the Planning and Development Division, which was approved by the then Prime Minister. Planning and Development Division carried out an exercise and adjusted Rs.5 billion only instead of Rs.10 billion, by reducing the allocations of other PSDP projects with the approval of the then Finance Minister Annex-VI . As such a total Rs.15 billion was allocated to PWP-II through adjustments during the fiscal year 2012-13. 6. In addition to above internal adjustments in the PSDP 2012-13, Finance Division has also approved an additional allocation of Rs.10 billion for PWP-II through supplementary grant, over and above the existing size of the PSDP 2012-13. Resultantly, allocation for PWP-II increased from Rs.22 billion to Rs.47 billion. 6. It is interesting to note that along with the report, an Office Memorandum of the Government of Pakistan, Planning Commission, Planning and Development Division, dated 06.11.2012 is appended, under the subject SUPPLEMENTARY GRANT FOR PEOPLES WORKS PROGRAMMEII PWP-IIT WITHIN THE EXISTING SIZE OF PSDP 2012-13 . It finds mention in the letter that the Federal Minister for Finance, Revenue and Planning Development has been pleased to accord approval for the provision of additional funds of Rs.5.0 billion through adjustment in PSDP 2012-13, proposed by the Planning Development Division, to divert it to PWP-II. The approved funds would be surrendered by the concerned Ministries/Divisions in favour of Cabinet Division for Const.P.No.20 of 2013 8 PWP-II. This document is available on the file of HRC No.11504-G of 2013 as Annexure-II, which is hereby directed to be clubbed with the instant case.

It is true that there were savings as the Ministry/Division indicated in the above Memorandum but the question arises that instead of spending these amounts on any other Public Development Programme, the same have been diverted in favour of the Cabinet Division for PWP-II for the purpose of allocating/distributing these funds to the Parliamentarians and the Notables knowing fully well that budgetary allocations of Rs.22 billion under this Head has already been exhausted, therefore, prima facie inference could only be drawn that the object and the purpose was the same as has been captioned in the news item of daily A/-Akhbar noted herein above, particularly, knowing well that there is no monitoring system in stricto senso to ensure the expenditure of PWP-II funds in a transparent manner. It is also to be noted Const.P.No.20 of 2013 9 that under the New System of Financial Control and Budgeting in order to maintain the financial disciplines, certain instructions were issued from time to time to be followed including with regard to the power of sanctioning projects, etc. 8. We have also issued notice to the Secretary Finance for the purpose of answering the questions, which have been framed in the order dated 16.04.2013, and are reproduced herein below:- i. As to whether the funds belonging to public exchequer have been allocated/distributed to MNAs/MPAs/ Notables in accordance with the Constitution and the law? ii. What is the phenomenon or procedure to monitor the spending of amount and as to whether the details of such developments are available? iii. Whether the contracts were granted to the contractors by following the PPRA Rules? No reply has been filed except contending that in HRC No.11504-G of 2013, reply was filed. The Finance Division is directed to file the reply of the above forthwith. 9. After having taken into consideration the abovenoted facts along with the viewpoint put forward by the Secretary, Cabinet Division, it is necessary to issue notice to the Special Secretary to the Prime Minister to submit SOPs, TORs or any instructions on the basis of which the Prime Minster is persuaded to allocate funds from PWP-II and as to whether there is any system in place for subjecting the schemes to technical scrutiny before allocating funds or it is left for the Prime Minster to exercise his discretion, without Const.P.No.20 of 2013 10 adhering to the Rules of Business and without sanction of the Cabinet, the Prime Minister alone enjoys unfettered powers to make allocations from the programmes on the request of the public representatives, including the Members of the Provincial Assemblies and the Notables and if it is so what is the justification available with the Special Secretary or the Prime Minister to accommodate any person being a representative or otherwise, etc. 10. The Accountant General Pakistan Revenues, is hereby directed to put up the details in respect of each development scheme, which finds mention in the list appended with letter dated 15.04.2013, copy of which shall also be supplied to the AGPR along with the names of the Executing Agency to whom the amounts have been allocated for spending for the execution of the schemes. Similarly, each of the Executing Agency in whose favour the cheques were issued, shall submit reply through the AGPR about feasibility of the scheme and also to disclose as to whether the PPRA Rules were followed in order to ensure transparency in the execution of the schemes and to what extent schemes have been executed alongwith details of funds so far utilized for each scheme separately. 11. Apparently, it seems that funds were diverted from the most important projects, like Diamer Basha Dam, Higher Education Commission, Lowari Tunnel, FATA, Saving Schemes Const.P.No.20 of 2013 11 etc noted herein above to the tune of Rs.22 billion, which in fact should not have been so done because of the importance of those projects, which undoubtedly have national importance and if are completed, the same being in the interest of the economic development of the country, ultimate benefit will pass on to the whole Nation. The manner in which the Finance Division and the Planning Development Division had diverted these funds to the Cabinet Division to increase the budgetary allocation to PWP-II from Rs.22 billion also seems to be nontransparent because in such like situation, when an amount has already been spent for the purpose, the preference should have been given for completion of the projects of national importance, instead of allocating this budget for execution of small schemes, which are meant only for the benefit of individuals and not for the whole Nation. 12. In view of the above, we direct the AGPR to ensure that pending decision of the instant petition the funds which have already been released to the Executing Agencies, including for the schemes enumerated in the list appended with the letter dated 15.04.2013 referred to herein above are not further distributed and the payments in respect of the schemes, details of which have been furnished by the Prime Minister s Secretariat shall be stopped immediately and a compliance report shall be sent to the Registrar of this Court by the AGPR for our perusal in Chamber within a period of Const.P.No.20 of 2013 12 three days, after receipt of this Order. Similarly, the Executing Agencies to whom the work has been assigned or the process of assigning of work is yet to be completed shall not proceed further with these schemes, till further orders passed by this Court. Similarly, notice to the Secretary, Planning Development Division, Government of Pakistan, be issued for filing reply of the facts and consideration which have already been noted in the order dated 16.04.2013 as well as in the instant order. Notice to the learned Attorney General for Pakistan be also issued for the next date. 13. Let this case be fixed on 30.04.2013. CJ. J. Islamabad 19.04.2013 J.", "Sentences": ["The Secretary, Cabinet Division, Government of Pakistan, filed the requisite reply CMA No.2222 of 2013 in pursuance of the earlier order dated 16.04.2013.", "She has explained the procedure of allocating the funds by the Prime Minister from Peoples Works Programme-II PWP-II .", "However, she stated that according to the budgetary provisions, an amount of Rs.22 billion annual was made available to the Prime Minister with an authority to sanction the amount in favour of the Parliamentarians and Notables for the development programmes.", "She further stated that being the Cabinet Secretary, she is not aware about the criteria/preferences of the Prime Minister for making allocation to different development schemes, as this subject is assigned to the Special Secretary of the Prime Minister and no sooner a Const.P.No.20 of 2013 2 sanction letter is issued, the same is processed in the Cabinet Division for onward transmission to the Accountant General Pakistan Revenues AGPR and the concerned Executing Agency.", "Admittedly, there is no system in place for monitoring the sanctioned funds.", "The AGPR is required to issue cheques to Executing

the PWP-II funds, a copy of sanction letter as a sample has also been placed on record.", "Prima facie, it seems that at the initial stage of sanctioning the funds from the Peoples Works Programme, no

Public , and the list attached therewith that on the demand of the Parliamentarians or the Notables , who somehow succeeded in approaching the Prime Minister for allocation of the funds for development from PWP, were obliged by making sanctions without following a transparent procedure nor the feasibility of the scheme for which the funds have been sanctioned was considered inasmuch as according to the list which has been furnished, not only the worthy Members of the Const.P.No.20 of 2013 3 Parliament, the Members of the Provincial Assemblies, the Notables have succeeded in getting allocation of their schemes from the Prime Minister.", "The Prime Minister is a person who represents the Government and the citizens, therefore, in sanctioning/allocating funds for the schemes, he is bound to follow the high standard of transparency.", "In doing so for the well-being of the general public and for this purpose, a system has to be institutionalized following the recognized principles of exercising discretion judiciously.", "The Prime Minister, being elected representative, is required to follow the procedure to prove equitable distribution of funds for schemes without

DATED 25 MARCH, 2013, ISLAMABAD REGARDING CORRUPTION OF EX-GOVERNMENT The daily Al-Akhbar has reported in the editorial of its publication of 25 March, 2013 that the former Government in its last days has diverted Rs.5 billion from important projects for the schemes of Members of National Assembly and powerful Ministers to facilitate their success in the forthcoming elections.", "The paper has reported that funds have been diverted from Diamer Basha Dam, Higher Education Commission, Lowari Tunnel, FATA, Saving Schemes along with other important projects and a total of Rs.43 billion have been provided to them Annex-I 2.", "While the contents of the newspaper clipping are not specific, these appear to allude to allocations made for schemes under the Peoples Works Programme-II.", "Allocation for Peoples Works Programme-II PWP-II is kept in Public Sector Development Programme PSDP as a block provision in the Demand of Cabinet Division.", "Funds from the block provision are released by the Cabinet Division on the directives of the Prime Minister issued by the Prime Minister s Secretariat to the executing agencies for implementation of schemes/projects directly without involvement of Planning and Development Division.", "An allocation of Rs.22 billion was kept for PWP-II in the PSDP 2012-13.", "On a request from the Prime Minister s Secretariat, a summary was moved by the Finance Division on 11 October, 2012, proposing provision of additional funds of Rs.10.00 billion for PWP-II during fiscal year 2012-13.", "The proposal was approved by the then Prime Minister.", "Pursuant to the approval of the Prime Minister, Finance Division advised Planning and Development Division on 15 October, 2012 for making necessary adjustments within the allocations of PSDP 2012-13 while ensuring that the overall size of PSDP does not increase beyond its existing size as a result of this supplementary grant Annex-II .", "Consequently, the Planning and Development Division issued adjustments letters on 6 November, 2012 and 23 November, 2012 to allocate Rs.5 billion each Rs.10 billion by diverting funds from other PSDP projects, with the approval of the then Finance Minister Annex-III, IV .", "The above adjustments included diversion from allocations to Diamer Basha Dam, Lowari Tunnel, FATA Higher Education Commission.", "However, on the request of Governor, Khyber Const.P.No.20 of 2013 7 Pakhtunkhwa, the amount of Rs.4 billion was subsequently recouped to FATA by reducing the equivalent allocation of other PSDP projects on 27 December, 2012 Annex-V .", "The Finance Division, after having been conveyed verbal directions for approval of additional allocation of Rs.10 billion by the then Prime Minister, moved a summary on 24 December, 2012 proposing another supplementary grant of Rs.10 billion for PWP-II through internal adjustment in the PSDP 2012-13 by the Planning and Development Division, which was approved by the then Prime Minister.", "Planning and Development Division carried out an exercise and adjusted Rs.5 billion only instead of Rs.10 billion, by reducing the allocations of other PSDP projects with the approval of the then Finance Minister Annex-VI .", "As such a total Rs.15 billion was allocated to PWP-II through adjustments during the fiscal year 2012-13.", "In addition to above internal adjustments in the PSDP 2012-13, Finance Division has also approved an additional allocation of Rs.10 billion for PWP-II through supplementary grant, over and above the existing size of the PSDP 2012-13.", "Resultantly, allocation for PWP-II increased from Rs.22 billion to Rs.47 billion.", "It is interesting to note that along with the report, an Office Memorandum of the Government of Pakistan, Planning Commission, Planning and Development Division, dated 06.11.2012 is appended, under the subject SUPPLEMENTARY GRANT FOR PEOPLES WORKS PROGRAMMEII PWP-IIT WITHIN THE EXISTING SIZE OF PSDP 2012-13 .", "It finds mention in the letter that the Federal Minister for Finance, Revenue and Planning Development has been pleased to accord approval for the provision of additional funds of Rs.5.0 billion through adjustment in PSDP 2012-13, proposed by the Planning Development Division, to divert it to PWP-II.", "The approved funds would be surrendered by the concerned Ministries/Divisions in favour of Cabinet Division for Const.P.No.20 of 2013 8 PWP-II.", "This document is available on the file of HRC No.11504-G of 2013 as Annexure-II, which is hereby directed to be clubbed with the instant case.", "For

"No reply has been filed except contending that in HRC No.11504-G of 2013, reply was filed.", "The Finance Division is directed to file the reply of the above forthwith.", "After having taken into

Precisely stating, facts of the case are that respondent\nNo.34 Ghulam Haider Thind s/o Malik Ghulam Rasool [hereinafter\nreferred to as “the respondent”] submitted nomination papers as a\ncandidate for Constituency PP-266 Layyah. An objection was raised\nagainst his candidature on the ground of non-payment of social\nsecurity dues of Rs.256500/- in respect of a flour mill (M/s Ahmad\nKhan Flour Mills, Layyah) owned by him for the months of March,\nMay & June, 2009 and April 2010 to March 2013. His nomination\npapers were rejected on 06.04.2013 for this and other reasons.\n\n3. It may not be out of context to note that in pursuance of\nthe letter dated 4.4.2013 by the Director, Punjab Employees Social\nSecurity, Institution an amount of Rs.1,40,300/- was deposited on\n\n5.4.2013.

As a consequence of the rejection of the Nomination\nPapers, an appeal was preferred by the respondent being Election\nAppeal No.09/2013, which has also been dismissed vide order dated\n\n10.4.2013. Relevant para therefrom reads thus: -\n\n“3. Although the appellant has made payment towards\nSocial Security Fund yet on account of the allegations\ndiscussed in he first part of the order, the appellant’s\ncandidature was to be dealt with consciously and by not\nallowing him to enter into the election process as qualified\ncandidate. The learned Returning Officer, in our considered\nview, has reached a right decision. The result of the above\ndiscussion is that the findings arrived at by the learned\nReturning Officer are upheld and this appeal preferred against\nrejection of the appellant’s nomination papers stands\n\ndismissed.”\n5. Against the above order, a Writ Petition No.9349/2013\nwas preferred by the respondent, which has been allowed vide\nimpugned order dated 23.4.2013, wherein regarding the outstanding\namount of contribution of Social Security it has been dealt with as\n\nunder:-\n\n“5. In our view the impugned order dated 10.4.2013\npassed by the learned Election Tribunal is not\n\nsustainable for the following reasons:-\n\n(1) eeseeseeseeseesevseesevsessesseseeeeeess\n\nCP No.636-2013 -4-\n\naii) ‘As far as the question of default is concerned,\nthere is nothing on record to show that the\npetitioner has controlling interest or majority\nshareholding in Ahmad Flour Mills, Layyah.\nThe fact that petitioner paid the liability of the\ncompany does not by itself indicate that the\npetitioner was liable to pay the said account.\nThe explanation offered by the learned counsel\nfor the petitioner that he paid the said amount as\na matter of abundant caution in order to avoid\nof possibility of being termed as a defaulter,\nseems plausible. Even otherwise, there is\nnothing on record that may indicate that the\npetitioner is in default of social security\ncontributions in his personal capacity or on the\nbasis of the liability of any company in which\n\nhe holds the controlling interest.”\n6. The petitioner, who is an objector being a voter, has\ninstituted instant petition for leave to appeal, inter alia, on the\nground that the case of the respondent falls within the mischief of\nArticle 63(1)(0) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan,\n1973 and on account of his default in making the payment of the\nGovernment dues, he was disqualified to contest the election.\nAccording to her, the learned High Court had not taken into\nconsideration, the judgment of the learned Returning Officer as well\nas the Appellate Forums. Because there was no question at all\nregarding holding the controlling shares or not, as admittedly, the\n\namount outstanding towards the Social Security Institution was\n\nCP No.636-2013 -5-\n\ndeposited by the respondent on 5.4.2013, as per the challan, which\nhas been produced before the Court.\n\n7. The learned counsel appearing for the respondent\nseriously controverted to the arguments, raised by her as according to\nhim in the Nomination Papers nothing was concealed and as the\npetitioner, while disclosing the factum of the outstanding dues had\nstated that to the extent of the shares of 9/16\" in M/s Ahmed Khan\nFlour Mills, his lady wife Saeeda Begum is the owner and so far the\nshares in her favour had not been transferred, as litigation is pending\nin the Civil Court as well as in the High Court, therefore, on account\nof this reason, that any amount, which was due, was not deposited\nhence the statement so made by the respondent is without concealing\nanything and therefore, following the law laid down by this Court in\n\nthe case of Munir Ahmed _and_another_yv. District Returning\n\nOfficer/Appellate Authority, Sargodha_and_others (2004 SCMR\n\n1456), the amount was deposited under the compelling\ncircumstances, as such, the respondent cannot be declared defaulter\nin the payment of Government Dues in terms of the Article 63(1)(0)\nof the Constitution. He has also stated that in order to examine an\nidentical question, a larger Bench of this Court has granted leave to\n\nappeal in Civil Petition No.626/2013 titled as “Jamil Hassan Khan v.\n\nReturning Officer, PP_174 Nankana Sahib and others”\n\n8. We have heard the petitioner and the learned counsel for\n\nthe respondent, Malik Muhammad Tariq, D.G., Punjab Employees’\n\nCP No.636-2013 -6-\n\nSocial Security Institution and Mr. Mumtaz Niazi, SSO, Layyah &\nD.G Khan and have perused the record.\n\n9. It may not be out of place to note that the Flour Mills in\nrespect whereof it is alleged that the respondent being its owner, was\noriginally registered by the Social Security Organization as Ahmed\nKhan Flour Mills, Layyah owned by Ch. Akram Khan and had been\ndepositing the Social Security Dues and according to DG, Punjab\nEmployees’ Social Security Institution an amount of Rs.1,40,000/-\nwas found due against the respondent commencing from the month\nof March, 2009 to onward and no sooner the Department learnt that\nthe respondent is contesting the election, it wrote a letter to the\nRetuning Officer pointing out the default, which had been committed\nby him and subsequent thereto on 5.4.2013 the amount referred to\nhereinabove has been deposited through different challans, the\nbreakup, which has been given hereinabove. Prima facie, it seems\nthat there is a default of the Government Dues for a period of more\nthan six months form the time when the Nomination Papers were\nfiled. Therefore, under the circumstances, the Returning Officer as\nwell as the appellate Court vide orders dated 06.04.2013 and\n10.4.2013 respectively came to the conclusion that the respondent\nwas disqualified from contesting the election.\n\n10. Leave to appeal is granted, inter alia, to examine as to\nwhether respondent Ghulam Haider Thind is not disqualified under\n\nArticle 63(1)(n) of the Constitution from contesting election from\n\nCP No.636-2013 -7-\n\nPP-266 Layyah, as admittedly he had paid government dues of\nRs.140300/- on 05.04.2013 towards Social Security for over six\nmonths at the time of filing of his nomination papers. And in the\nmeanwhile respondent Ghulam Haider Thind is restrained from\ncontesting election for Constituency PP-266 polling of which is\n\nscheduled to be held on 11.05.2013.\n\n11.

The learned Returning Officer, in our considered view, has reached a right decision. The result of the above discussion is that the findings arrived at by the learned Returning Officer are upheld and this appeal preferred against rejection of the appellant s nomination papers stands dismissed. 5. Against the above order, a Writ Petition No.9349/2013 was preferred by the respondent, which has been allowed vide impugned order dated 23.4.2013, wherein regarding the outstanding amount of contribution of Social Security it has been dealt with as under:- 5. In our view the impugned order dated 10.4.2013 passed by the learned Election Tribunal is not sustainable for the following reasons:- 1 eeseeseeseeseesevseesevsessesseseeeeeess CP No.636-2013 -4aii As far as the question of default is concerned, there is nothing on record to show that the petitioner has controlling interest or majority shareholding in Ahmad Flour Mills, Layyah. The fact that petitioner paid the liability of the company does not by itself indicate that the petitioner was liable to pay the said account. The explanation offered by the learned counsel for the petitioner that he paid the said amount as a matter of abundant caution in order to avoid of possibility of being termed as a defaulter, seems plausible. Even otherwise, there is nothing on record that may indicate that the petitioner is in default of social security contributions in his personal capacity or on the basis of the liability of any company in which he holds the controlling interest. 6. The petitioner, who is an objector being a voter, has instituted instant petition for leave to appeal, inter alia, on the ground that the case of the respondent falls within the mischief of Article 63 1 0 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 and on account of his default in making the payment of the Government dues, he was disqualified to contest the election. According to her, the learned High Court had not taken into consideration, the judgment of the learned Returning Officer as well as the Appellate Forums. Because there was no question at all regarding holding the controlling shares or not, as admittedly, the amount outstanding towards the Social Security Institution was CP No.636-2013 -5deposited by the respondent on 5.4.2013, as per the challan, which has been produced before the Court. 7. The learned counsel appearing for the respondent seriously controverted to the arguments, raised by her as according to him in the Nomination Papers nothing was concealed and as the petitioner, while disclosing the factum of the outstanding dues had stated that to the extent of the shares of 9/16 in M/s Ahmed Khan Flour Mills, his lady wife Saeeda Begum is the owner and so far the shares in her favour had not been transferred, as litigation is pending in the Civil Court as well as in the High Court, therefore, on account of this reason, that any amount, which was due, was not deposited hence the statement so made by the respondent is without concealing anything and therefore, following the law laid down by this Court in the case of Munir Ahmed and another yv. District Returning Officer/Appellate Authority, Sargodha and others 2004 SCMR 1456 , the amount was deposited under the compelling circumstances, as such, the respondent cannot be declared defaulter in the payment of Government Dues in terms of the Article 63 1 0 of the Constitution. He has also stated that in order to examine an identical question, a larger Bench of this Court has granted leave to appeal in Civil Petition No.626/2013 titled as Jamil Hassan Khan v. Returning Officer, PP 174 Nankana Sahib and others 8. We have heard the petitioner and the learned counsel for the respondent, Malik Muhammad Tariq, D.G., Punjab Employees CP No.636-2013 -6Social Security Institution and Mr. Mumtaz Niazi, SSO, Layyah D.G Khan and have perused the record. 9. It may not be out of place to note that the Flour Mills in respect whereof it is alleged that the respondent being its owner, was originally registered by the Social Security Organization as Ahmed Khan Flour Mills, Layyah owned by Ch. Akram Khan and had been depositing the Social Security Dues and according to DG, Punjab Employees Social Security Institution an amount of Rs.1,40,000/- was found due against the respondent commencing from the month of March, 2009 to onward and no sooner the Department learnt that the respondent is contesting the election, it wrote a letter to the Retuning Officer pointing out the default, which had been committed by him and subsequent thereto on 5.4.2013 the amount referred to hereinabove has been deposited through different challans, the breakup, which has been given hereinabove. Prima facie, it seems that there is a default of the Government Dues for a period of more than six months form the time when the Nomination Papers were filed. Therefore, under the circumstances, the Returning Officer as well as the appellate Court vide orders dated 06.04.2013 and 10.4.2013 respectively came to the conclusion that the respondent was disqualified from contesting the election. 10. Leave to appeal is granted, inter alia, to examine as to whether respondent Ghulam Haider Thind is not disqualified under Article 63 1 n of the Constitution from contesting election from CP No.636-2013 -7PP-266 Layyah, as admittedly he had paid government dues of Rs.140300/- on 05.04.2013 towards Social Security for over six months at the time of filing of his nomination papers. And in the meanwhile respondent Ghulam Haider Thind is restrained from contesting election for Constituency PP-266 polling of which is scheduled to be held on 11.05.2013. 11.

Precisely stating the facts of the case are that the\npetitioner being a candidate in the forthcoming elections from\nPP-61, Faisalabad, objected to the candidature of the respondent\nfrom the same constituency before the Returning Officer (RO)\ncontending that he being a candidate for the seat of Nazim of\nUnion Council 134 (held in the year 2005) produced a fake and\n\nforged matriculation certificate showing his date of birth to\n\nCP.No.756-L of 2013 -2-\n\n02.04.1979 instead of 02.08.1981, on this a case was registered\nagainst him thus he is not entitled to contest the election, as he\ndid not fulfil the conditions laid down in Article 62 of the\nConstitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. The\nobjection was contested by the respondent. The RO on having\ntaken into consideration the objection observed “the candidate\nhas not categorically denied in his written reply that he has not\nmentioned his date of birth in his matriculation certificate as\n02.04.1979 while filing his nomination papers for contesting the\nelection of Nazim Union Council No.134. A copy of the certificate\nhas been appended with the objection petition showing that birth\nentry has forged by the candidate as 02.04.1979 to make himself\neligible to contest the election for the seat of Nazim Union Council\nwas a person who has dishonestly forged an entry and made\nhimself eligible to contest the particular election cannot be terms\nas Sadiq and Amin so his nomination paper is hit by provision of\nArticle 62 of the Constitution”.

At this juncture, it would not be out of context to\nmention that according to Section 152 of the Punjab Local\nGovernment Ordinance, 2001, a person who is at least 25 years\nof age besides fulfilling other conditions was qualified to contest\nthe election. It seems that the respondent was not of 25 years of\n\nage as his date of birth has been shown to be 02.08.1981 in the\n\nCP.No.756-L of 2013 -3-\n\nmatriculation certificate but somehow he managed to produce a\nmatriculation certificate with the date of birth as 02.04.1979.\n\n4. The respondent preferred an appeal before the Election\nTribunal, which has been allowed on 13.04.2013, against which\nthe petitioner preferred a Constitution Petition before a larger\nBench of the Lahore High Court, Lahore, which has not been\ndisposed of on merits for the reasons mentioned in the impugned\norder, para 2 therefrom is reproduced herein below: -\n\n\"2. We have heard the learned counsel for the\nparties.

Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that in\nview of the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned High\nCourt may have not refused to exercise jurisdiction under Article\n199 of the Constitution, as there is a conclusive findings against\nthe respondent that he has forged his date of birth in the\nmatriculation certificate in order to make himself eligible to\ncontest the election of Union Council and had shown his date of\nbirth to be 02.04.1979 instead of 02.08.1981, as it was so held\nby the Election Tribunal constituted under the Punjab Local\nGovernment Ordinance, 2001, vide order dated 22.05.2007 copy\nof which is also available on record, passed in Election Petition\nNo.29-E of 2005.

Khawaja, J. - Constitution Petition No.105 of 2012 was filed by two\n\njournalists namely, Hamid Mir and Absar Alam Haider. They were later joined by other\njournalists. A number of issues have been raised in this Constitution Petition. Vide order\npassed by us on 15.01.2013, a two-Member Commission has been appointed by the Court\nfor the purpose of preparing a report on nine Terms of References (ToRs) numbered A to\nI, which have been set out in our order dated 15.01.2013. The Commission has already\nsubmitted a report in respect of ToR No.F and is due to finalize its report on the\nremaining ToRs by 31.05.2013.\n\n2. While the Commission is engaged in finalizing its report, the issue of establishing\nand maintenance of accounts by the Government (respondent No.1) which have not been\nsubjected to audit has come to the fore. Over the last few hearings of this petition, we\nhave been informed that substantial sums of money have been spent by the Ministry of\nInformation and Broadcasting. Details of these expenditures have neither been disclosed\n\nnor audited by the office of the Auditor General. This has raised constitutional issues. The\n\nConst.P.1052012 2\n\npetitioners have also highlighted the need for openness and transparency in spending\nfunds from the public exchequer which have been collected by the government by way of\ntaxes, fiscal levies and impositions. It has also been submitted by the petitioners that\nsubstantial amounts have been allocated to various ministries/departments which have\nnot been audited.\n\n3. There is a fundamental premise, relating to disclosure/audit, on which allocation\nof such funds and their spending is to be judged. Article 19A of the Constitution\nstipulates in very clear terms that “every citizen shall have the right to have access to\ninformation in all matters of public importance, subject to regulation and reasonable restrictions\nimposed by law”. Article 19 of the Constitution, inter alia, guarantees “ freedom of the press,\nsubject to any reasonable restrictions imposed by law”. Such reasonable restriction can only\nrelate to and be imposed “in the interest of the glory of Islam or the integrity, security or defence\nof Pakistan or friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality, or in\nrelation to contempt of Court, [commission of] or incitement to an offence”. The fundamental\npremise to be kept in mind, is that all funds in the State exchequer are funds which have\ncome out of the pockets of the people of Pakistan. These funds are the product of the toil,\nsweat, tears and blood of the people. The Government is at most a trustee and custodian\nof these funds and is accountable for the expenditure of these funds in a fiduciary\ncapacity as envisioned in the Constitution. The only exception against public disclosure is\ngiven in Articles 19 and 19A of the Constitution referred to above. Even where the\ngovernment or the legislature choose to regulate or impose restrictions upon disclosure of\ndisbursement of funds, such restrictions cannot be arbitrary but have to be reasonable. As\nto what is or what is not reasonable is a matter of which the government is not the sole\narbiter. It is constrained by the Constitution and by law. Any restriction on disclosure of\nexpenses made from the exchequer, which the government imposes, or the legislature\nprovides for, would be justiceable on the touchstone of Articles 19 and 19A of the\nConstitution.\n\n4. It is in this context that at least since September, 2012, we have repeatedly been\nasking the Government to state its basis to justify non-disclosure of expenses from the\n\npublic exchequer; but, it is most unfortunate that despite our repeated directions and\n\nConst.P.1052012 3\n\norders nothing material has been done. In our order dated 13.9.2012, we had directed the\nrespondent Ministry to “set out in detail the budget allocation for the financial years ending\n30.6.2010, 30.6.2011, 30.6.2012 and 30.6.2013 alongwith supplementary grants”. We had\nfurther required the Ministry to furnish details of the budget allocation and\nsupplementary grants for these years alongwith the report of the Auditor General of\nPakistan in respect of the said budget allocations. Although this was required to be done\nbefore 17.9.2012, we note that our order has not been complied with. Instead, on\n17.10.2012, learned counsel representing the respondent Ministry stated that there were\nonly three heads of account in respect of which a privilege against disclosure was being\nclaimed namely, (a) Special Publicity Fund, (b) Secret Service Expenditure and (c) the\nInstitute of Regional Studies. A relatively small amount totaling Rs.14,00,00,000/- (rupees\nfourteen crores) approximately was mentioned as the sum expended from these accounts.\nThe order which was then passed by us on 20.12.2012 is of relevance to the question\npresently being considered by us. The issue is as to whether “the federal budgets have\nallocated from time to time to the federal Ministry of Information and Broadcasting any funds that\nmay be spent in its discretion or that may be spent in secrecy without disclosing the purpose of the\ndisbursements or the identity of its recipients? If so did the said Ministry have a constitutional\nbasis for such disbursements?” It was clarified by us that in line with the provisions of\nArticles 19A and 19 of the Constitution, we were not inclined to accept the contention of\nthe Ministry that use and expenditure of these funds could be kept secret. We also\nobserved and recorded as under:\n\n“Prima facie, while the Ministry may claim privilege from making public disclosure\nof certain parts of its budget, such privilege is not automatically available to the\nGovernment. It must be claimed from the Court. Information for which secrecy is\nsought must be clearly marked and the reasons for seeking secrecy must also be\nclearly stated. The Court can then make a determination on this point in line with\n\nthe law and the Constitution”.\n\n5. In the same order we noted the submissions of Mr. Asad Kharal, a journalist, who\nhas been impleaded as a petitioner, that “the budgets of 27 other Ministries also contain secret\nfunds similar to the ones which are in place in the Ministry of Information”. If correct, this\n\nwould be a disturbing matter since secret funds can potentially be a tool for undermining\n\nConst.P.1052012 4\n\nthe rights of citizens protected under Articles 19 and 19A of the Constitution and may\nencourage waste and corruption. It has consistently been stated by this Court that all\npublic authorities and functionaries are fiduciaries of the public and receive their\nperquisites, positions and funding from the public. The Auditor General is\nconstitutionally empowered to have access to information relating to budgeted\nexpenditures and supplementary grants in order to ensure that there is no misuse of\nmoney spent from the public exchequer and the possibility of corrupt practices is\neliminated. It may also usefully be noted that in our three immediate preceding orders\ndated 25.04.2013, 02.05.2013 & 06.05.2013, we have again and again emphasized to the\nGovernment that without a lawful justification, there cannot be a denial of disclosure or\nwithholding of accounts from audit by the Auditor General. Numerous opportunities\nwere given to the learned Attorney General but as noted, he has not been able to render\nany assistance whatsoever or to give any meaningful response to the simple question\nraised by us.\n\n6. Today, the Attorney General started his submissions by referring to Article 241 of\nthe Constitution, in support of the Government's plea that some funds identified by the\nGovernment itself, are not subject to audit by the Auditor General. We have gone through\nArticle 241 of the Constitution and note that it is wholly irrelevant and has no nexus\nwhatsoever with the question of audit of accounts. Article 241 ibid relates to service\nmatters and deals with the “appointment to and conditions of service of persons in the service of\nPakistan”. We are, therefore, quite surprised that this Article was referred to in the context\nof expenditure from the exchequer referred to above.\n\n7. When this was pointed out to the Attorney General, he readily conceded that\nArticle 241 of the Constitution had no relevance in the present matter. We, therefore, are\nconstrained to record the lack of preparation and seriousness on the part of the Attorney\nGeneral in this important Constitutional case. The Attorney General then stated that Para-\n130, Appendix-VIII of the General Financial Rules, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as the\n‘GFR’) provided complete justification against disclosure/audit of expenses which the\ngovernment itself designates as being not subject to audit or disclosure. When we asked\n\nthe learned Attorney General to give us the legal sanction, under which the GFR were\n\nConst.P.1052012 5\n\nmade or adapted in Pakistan, he was unable to do so; instead he referred to Section 124 of\nthe Government of India Act, Article 224 of the Constitution of 1956, Article 241 of the\nConstitution of 1962 and Article 268 of the Constitution of 1973. Article 268 of the\nConstitution, inter alia, provides that “ except as provided by this Article, all existing laws shall,\nsubject to the Constitution, continue in force, so far as applicable and with the necessary\nadaptations, until altered, repealed or amended by the appropriate Legislature”. In the light of\nthis Article the obvious question which arose and which was put to the Attorney General\nwas to show as to how the GFR can be treated as existing law. We were given no\njustification from the government in support of a plea that GFR can be treated as ‘existing\nlaw’. At this point, we may add that there has been no adaptation of the GFR in Pakistan\nand none was shown to us by the learned Attorney General. In India, however, we have\ntentatively ascertained that some adaptation was made after 1947. We are also quite\namazed that nobody in government seems to be aware of the legal sanction behind the\nGFR and yet the same are being accepted (contrary to the Constitution and law) as having\nlegal backing. Surprisingly, this absence of relevant statutory backing is reflected in\nconfusing and misleading replies given in the CMAs filed by the Government. It is the\nGovernment's case in CMA No.3827 of 2012 that “transaction /operation under the head of\naccount “Secret Service Expenditure” is not auditable. A certificate is recorded by the Controlling\nOfficer as required vide S.No.37 of General Financial Rules Vol. II”. In CMA No. 3827 of 2012,\nno indication whatsoever is given as to the source of legitimacy of the GFR. Sub-Rule (5)\nof Rule 37 stipulates that “the accounts of secret service expenditure will not be subjected to\nscrutiny by the Audit authority”. CMA No. 446 of 2012 filed by the Government makes the\naverment, inter alia, that “the details of spending of amounts specified as secret funds in the\nbudget cannot be divulged to the petitioners as the same are different from other public funds which\nare open to scrutiny and audit”. While no basis has been given for this averment made in the\nCMA a brief has been appended with the said application. For ease of reference and in\n\nview of its significance, the brief is reproduced in its entirety as under:-\n\n“BRIEF :\n\n1. “Secret Service Fund is an allocation made under the Annual Budget Book (now\nCFY:2012-13) titled under “DEMAND NO.058: Head of Account ID 1358: Secret Service\nExpenditure” (Rs. 1,20,00,000/) which is similar in nature to Secret Fund provided to other\n\nGOP organizations. Besides, regular annual allocation in this Head of Account, special\n\nConst.P.1052012 6\n\nallocations are made by the Prime Minister for various specific assignments and projects\ngiven to this Ministry from time to time. The expenditure for such allocations are maintained\nseparately as per law.\n\n2. \"The Secret Service Fund is judiciously utilized by the Secretary of Information &\nBroadcasting as Principal Accounting Officer (PAO) to supplement and support the\npublicity and projection efforts of the Government's development policies /action plan, and to\ncounter negative propaganda which is against national interest, both within and outside the\ncountry. Since the expenditure incurred on such sensitive assignments cannot be met out of\nregular auditable budgetary allocation, all the previous governments in the past have been\nplacing these funds at the disposal of this Ministry which is strictly utilized in accordance\nwith the rules and regulations governing “Secret Service Expenditure” issued by the Finance\nDivision from time to time. The fund has always been audited by various Finance Secretaries\nin the past as and when required as per regulations” .\n\n3. “The Secret Service Fund was established since long most probably in the 70s. The\nallocation for specific assignments/projects was initiated sometimes in the 80s. Logically, it\nwould not be possible to trace the record of last 30 years in order to find out as to when the\nfund was formally established. However, one of the documents traced indicate that the Bank\nAccount was shifted from Muslim Commercial Bank, Civic Centre, Islamabad to National\nBank of Pakistan, Model Branch, Islamabad in 1997. At present the Accounts are being\nmaintained in the National Bank of Pakistan as per law.”\n\n5. “The annual budget documents of the Finance Division titled Demands for Grant and\nAppropriations provides details of budget allocation out of FEDERAL GOVERNMENT’S\nCONSOLIDATED FUND to each Ministry/Division/Department/rganization. The\n\nFinance Act 2012-13 which extends to whole of Pakistan in terms of Federal Government\n\nfinancial proposals gives legal effect to this authorized budget and its components including\nallocations under classified head of Secret Service Fund (SSF) of M/o I&B. The said Act\npassed by the Parliament is duly assented by the President, authorizing each\nMinister Division including I&B to incur expenditure as per allocation. Historically this\nfund has existed since 1947-50 onwards when the Federal Capital was located in Karachi. It\nhas time tested authenticity and utility.”\n\n6(a). “The AGPR’s quarterly release of SSF to 1&B Division is always preceded by provision\nof Certificate of Expenditure for the earlier quarter, a copy of which is invariably sent to\nDirectorate General of Audit in terms of Para- 37 of Appendix -8 of GFR Vol-Il, for its\n\nrecord and reference.”\n\n8. The salient aspects of the above brief, which represents the case of the Federation,\ncan now be noted. It is not disputed that the Secret Service Fund is an allocation made\nunder the Annual Budget Book titled Demand No.058. A self serving statement has been\nmade that the Secret Service Fund is judiciously utilized by the Secretary of Information &\nBroadcasting as Principal Accounting Officer. It has also been stated in the brief that the\nannual budget document of the Finance Division titled “Demands for Grant of\nAppropriations” provides details of budget allocations out of the Federal Government's\nConsolidated Fund to each Ministry/Division/Department/ Organization and these\n\namounts including allocations are classified as Secret Service Fund. From this, it is\n\nConst.P.1052012 7\n\nevident that the government has allocated funds to various Ministries, which funds or\nexpenses therefrom are neither disclosed nor audited. One of the petitioners namely, Mr.\nAsad Kharal has stated in his CMA No. 5226 of 2013 that there are 27 Ministries to which\nfunds have been allocated but which are neither audited nor disclosed to the public on the\nuntenable plea that the same are secret.\n\n9. What we also find surprising is that in the above referred brief, it is stated that “the\nSecret Service Fund was established since long, most probably in the 70s” (emphasis provided).\nAt another point in the brief, it has been stated contrary to this averment, that the “Secret\nService Fund is existing since 1947-50 onwards”. When the above submissions are analyzed,\nit becomes evident that without any statutory or constitutional backing, Rule 37(5) of GFR\ncannot be legally sustained. If indeed, the Federal Government is seeking protection under\nthe aforesaid Rule, this is not legally permissible because no justification or basis or source\nof Rule 37(5) of the GFR has been shown to us. Under the Constitution, in Articles 78 to 86\nthe financial procedure for the Federation’s accounts has been clearly spelt out. The entire\nrevenues of the Federation are either part of the Federal Consolidated Fund or the same\nare part of the Public Accounts of the Federation. There is no third account of the\nFederation. No part of the Consolidated Fund and the Public Accounts of the Federation,\nis exempted from audit under the Constitution.\n\n10. We can now advert to two Statutes, which are of direct relevance to the issue\nbefore us; these are the Auditor General’s (Functions, Powers and Terms & Conditions of\nService) Ordinance, 2001 and the Controller General of Accounts (Appointment, Functions &\nPowers) Ordinance, 2001. It is quite clear from the submissions made by the learned\nAttorney General in Court today, that the provisions of Article 169 and 170 of the\nConstitution have not been taken note of by him nor is he aware of the existence of these\nstatutes as is evident from his misguided reliance on Article 268 of the Constitution, noted\nabove. Article 170 of the Constitution, it may be noted, was materially amended in 2010\nthrough the 18 Amendment. The original Article was renumbered as sub-Article (1) and\na new sub-Article (2) was added. The same being directly relevant is reproduced as\n\nunder:-\n\nConst.P.1052012 8\n\n“(2) The audit of the accounts of the Federal and of the Provincial\nGovernments and the accounts of any authority or body established by, or\nunder the control of, the Federal or Provincial Government shall be\n\nconducted by the Auditor-General, who shall determine the extent and\n\nnature of such audit”. (underlining for emphasis is ours)\n\n11. By virtue of the amended Article, the audit of accounts of the Federal and the\nProvincial Governments must be conducted by the Auditor General, who is also to\ndetermine the extent and nature of the said audit. The Constitution does not recognize any\nexception to the provisions of Article 170(2) ibid. In this view of the matter the\nConsolidated Fund and Public Accounts cannot remain unaudited. The provisions of the\ntwo statutes of 2001, which are relevant in this case, can now be examined. The terms of\nappointment in service of the Auditor General have been given in Section 4 of the Auditor\nGeneral’s (Functions, Powers and Terms & Conditions of Service) Ordinance, 2001. It has\nalso been expressly stipulated in section 7 of the statute that “the Auditor-General shall on\nthe basis of such audit as he may consider appropriate and necessary, certify the accounts, compiled\nand prepared by Controller-General of Account ...”. Section 8 of the statute is also extremely\n\nrelevant. It directs and mandates the Auditor General to “audit all expenditure from the\n\nConsolidated Fund of the Federation ... and to ascertain whether the moneys shown in the accounts\n\nas having been disbursed were legally available for, and applicable to, the service or purpose to\nwhich they have been applied or charged and whether the expenditure conforms to the authority\nwhich governs it....” (emphasis provided). Section 8(b) of the statute requires the Auditor-\nGeneral to “audit all transactions of the Federation and of the Provinces relating to Public\nAccounts (emphasis provided)”. It thus becomes abundantly clear that where the amount\nis charged on the Consolidated Fund or relates to the Public Accounts of the Federation or\nof the Provinces, the same must be audited by the Auditor-General without exception.\n\n12. The powers of the Auditor General in connection with the audit of accounts have\nbeen given in Section 14 of the aforesaid statute. This legal provision stipulates that “the\nAuditor-General shall, in connection with the performance of his duties under this Ordinance, have\nauthority:-- (a) to inspect any office of the accounts, under the control of the Federation or of a\nProvince ... (b) to require that any accounts, books, papers and other documents which deal with,\n\nor form, the basis of or otherwise relevant to the transactions to which his duties in respect of audit\n\nConst.P.1052012 9\n\nextend, shall be sent to such place as he may direct for his inspection...”. It is not necessary to\nreproduce the entire text of the aforesaid Ordinance or of the Controller General of\nAccounts (Appointment, Functions & Powers) Ordinance, 2001 because the same are clear\nand do not exclude any amount forming part of the Consolidated Fund or the Public\nAccount from audit.\n\n13. As we have noted above sub-Article (2) of Article 170 of the Constitution was\nadded by the 18 Amendment which amply empowers and directs the Auditor General to\nfulfill his constitutional obligation as watchdog of the people of Pakistan. It is only\nthrough audit that it can be ensured that the hard earned income of citizens of this\ncountry is being spent for lawful purposes. Without the audit specified by the\nConstitution and the two statutes, referred to hereinabove, there can be little or no room\nfor any transparency. Absence of audit by the Auditor General, apart from being violative\nof the Constitution and law, is a sure and certain invitation to corruption and lack of\naccountability.\n\n14. We have already noted in our judgment in Watan Party and others vs. Federation of\n\nPakistan and others (PLD 2012 SC 292) that Article 19A of the Constitution, which also has\nbeen added through the 18 Amendment, constitutes a major advance of fundamental\nrights and is essential for the effective functioning of democracy. In that judgment, we\nheld that “[t]he very essence of a democratic dispensation is informed choice. It is through such\nchoice that the political sovereign, the People of Pakistan acquire the ability to reward or punish\ntheir elected representatives or aspirants to elected office, when it is time for the People to exercise\n\ntheir choice.

Khawaja, J. - Constitution Petition No.105 of 2012 was filed by two journalists namely, Hamid Mir and Absar Alam Haider. They were later joined by other journalists. A number of issues have been raised in this Constitution Petition. Vide order passed by us on 15.01.2013, a two-Member Commission has been appointed by the Court for the purpose of preparing a report on nine Terms of References ToRs numbered A to I, which have been set out in our order dated 15.01.2013. The Commission has already submitted a report in respect of ToR No.F and is due to finalize its report on the remaining ToRs by 31.05.2013. 2. While the Commission is engaged in finalizing its report, the issue of establishing and maintenance of accounts by the Government respondent No.1 which have not been subjected to audit has come to the fore. Over the last few hearings of this petition, we have been informed that substantial sums of money have been spent by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. Details of these expenditures have neither been disclosed nor audited by the office of the Auditor General. This has raised constitutional issues. The 2 petitioners have also highlighted the need for openness and transparency in spending funds from the public exchequer which have been collected by the government by way of taxes, fiscal levies and impositions. It has also been submitted by the petitioners that substantial amounts have been allocated to various ministries/departments which have not been audited. 3. There is a fundamental premise, relating to disclosure/audit, on which allocation of such funds and their spending is to be judged. Article 19A of the Constitution stipulates in very clear terms that every citizen shall have the right to have access to information in all matters of public importance, subject to regulation and reasonable restrictions imposed by law . Article 19 of the Constitution, inter alia, guarantees freedom of the press, subject to any reasonable restrictions imposed by law . Such reasonable restriction can only relate to and be imposed in the interest of the glory of Islam or the integrity, security or defence of Pakistan or friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality, or in relation to contempt of Court, commission of or incitement to an offence . The fundamental premise to be kept in mind, is that all funds in the State exchequer are funds which have come out of the pockets of the people of Pakistan. These funds are the product of the toil, sweat, tears and blood of the people. The Government is at most a trustee and custodian of these funds and is accountable for the expenditure of these funds in a fiduciary capacity as envisioned in the Constitution. The only exception against public disclosure is given in Articles 19 and 19A of the Constitution referred to above. Even where the government or the legislature choose to regulate or impose restrictions upon disclosure of disbursement of funds, such restrictions cannot be arbitrary but have to be reasonable. As to what is or what is not reasonable is a matter of which the government is not the sole arbiter. It is constrained by the Constitution and by law. Any restriction on disclosure of expenses made from the exchequer, which the government imposes, or the legislature provides for, would be justiceable on the touchstone of Articles 19 and 19A of the Constitution. 4. It is in this context that at least since September, 2012, we have repeatedly been asking the Government to state its basis to justify non-disclosure of expenses from the public exchequer; but, it is most unfortunate that despite our repeated directions and 3 orders nothing material has been done. In our order dated 13.9.2012, we had directed the respondent Ministry to set out in detail the budget allocation for the financial years ending 30.6.2010, 30.6.2011, 30.6.2012 and 30.6.2013 alongwith supplementary grants . We had further required the Ministry to furnish details of the budget allocation and supplementary grants for these years alongwith the report of the Auditor General of Pakistan in respect of the said budget allocations. Although this was required to be done before 17.9.2012, we note that our order has not been complied with. Instead, on 17.10.2012, learned counsel representing the respondent Ministry stated that there were only three heads of account in respect of which a privilege against disclosure was being claimed namely, a Special Publicity Fund, b Secret Service Expenditure and c the Institute of Regional Studies. A relatively small amount totaling Rs.14,00,00,000/- rupees fourteen crores approximately was mentioned as the sum expended from these accounts. The order which was then passed by us on 20.12.2012 is of relevance to the question presently being considered by us. The issue is as to whether the federal budgets have allocated from time to time to the federal Ministry of Information and Broadcasting any funds that may be spent in its discretion or that may be spent in secrecy without disclosing the purpose of the disbursements or the identity of its recipients? If so did the said Ministry have a constitutional basis for such disbursements? It was clarified by us that in line with the provisions of Articles 19A and 19 of the Constitution, we were not inclined to accept the contention of the Ministry that use and expenditure of these funds could be kept secret. We also observed and recorded as under: Prima facie, while the Ministry may claim privilege from making public disclosure of certain parts of its budget, such privilege is not automatically available to the Government. It must be claimed from the Court. Information for which secrecy is sought must be clearly marked and the reasons for seeking secrecy must also be clearly stated. The Court can then make a determination on this point in line with the law and the Constitution . 5. In the same order we noted the submissions of Mr. Asad Kharal, a journalist, who has been impleaded as a petitioner, that the budgets of 27 other Ministries also contain secret funds similar to the ones which are in place in the Ministry of Information . If correct, this would be a disturbing matter since secret funds can potentially be a tool for undermining 4 the rights of citizens protected under Articles 19 and 19A of the Constitution and may encourage waste and corruption. It has consistently been stated by this Court that all public authorities and functionaries are fiduciaries of the public and receive their perquisites, positions and funding from the public. The Auditor General is constitutionally empowered to have access to information relating to budgeted expenditures and supplementary grants in order to ensure that there is no misuse of money spent from the public exchequer and the possibility of corrupt practices is eliminated. It may also usefully be noted that in our three immediate preceding orders dated 25.04.2013, 02.05.2013 06.05.2013, we have again and again emphasized to the Government that without a lawful justification, there cannot be a denial of disclosure or withholding of accounts from audit by the Auditor General. Numerous opportunities were given to the learned Attorney General but as noted, he has not been able to render any assistance whatsoever or to give any meaningful response to the simple question raised by us. 6. Today, the Attorney General started his submissions by referring to Article 241 of the Constitution, in support of the Government s plea that some funds identified by the Government itself, are not subject to audit by the Auditor General. We have gone through Article 241 of the Constitution and note that it is wholly irrelevant and has no nexus whatsoever with the question of audit of accounts. Article 241 ibid relates to service matters and deals with the appointment to and conditions of service of persons in the service of Pakistan . We are, therefore, quite surprised that this Article was referred to in the context of expenditure from the exchequer referred to above. 7. When this was pointed out to the Attorney General, he readily conceded that Article 241 of the Constitution had no relevance in the present matter. We, therefore, are constrained to record the lack of preparation and seriousness on the part of the Attorney General in this important Constitutional case. The Attorney General then stated that Para130, Appendix-VIII of the General Financial Rules, 1973 hereinafter referred to as the GFR provided complete justification against disclosure/audit of expenses which the government itself designates as being not subject to audit or disclosure. When we asked the learned Attorney General to give us the legal sanction, under which the GFR were 5 made or adapted in Pakistan, he was unable to do so; instead he referred to Section 124 of the Government of India Act, Article 224 of the Constitution of 1956, Article 241 of the Constitution of 1962 and Article 268 of the Constitution of 1973. Article 268 of the Constitution, inter alia, provides that except as provided by this Article, all existing laws shall, subject to the Constitution, continue in force, so far as applicable and with the necessary adaptations, until altered, repealed or amended by the appropriate Legislature . In the light of this Article the obvious question which arose and which was put to the Attorney General was to show as to how the GFR can be treated as existing law. We were given no justification from the government in support of a plea that GFR can be treated as existing law . At this point, we may add that there has been no adaptation of the GFR in Pakistan and none was shown to us by the learned Attorney General. In India, however, we have tentatively ascertained that some adaptation was made after 1947. We are also quite amazed that nobody in government seems to be aware of the legal sanction behind the GFR and yet the same are being accepted contrary to the Constitution and law as having legal backing. Surprisingly, this absence of relevant statutory backing is reflected in confusing and misleading replies given in the CMAs filed by the Government. It is the Government s case in CMA No.3827 of 2012 that transaction /operation under the head of account Secret Service Expenditure is not auditable. A certificate is recorded by the Controlling Officer as required vide S.No.37 of General Financial Rules Vol. II . In CMA No. 3827 of 2012, no indication whatsoever is given as to the source of legitimacy of the GFR. Sub-Rule 5 of Rule 37 stipulates that the accounts of secret service expenditure will not be subjected to scrutiny by the Audit authority . CMA No. 446 of 2012 filed by the Government makes the averment, inter alia, that the details of spending of amounts specified as secret funds in the budget cannot be divulged to the petitioners as the same are different from other public funds which are open to scrutiny and audit . While no basis has been given for this averment made in the CMA a brief has been appended with the said application. For ease of reference and in view of its significance, the brief is reproduced in its entirety as under:- BRIEF : 1. Secret Service Fund is an allocation made under the Annual Budget Book now CFY:2012-13 titled under DEMAND NO.058: Head of Account ID 1358: Secret Service Expenditure Rs. 1,20,00,000/ which is similar in nature to Secret Fund provided to other GOP organizations. Besides, regular annual allocation in this Head of Account, special 6 allocations are made by the Prime Minister for various specific assignments and projects given to this Ministry from time to time. The expenditure for such allocations are maintained separately as per law. 2. The Secret Service Fund is judiciously utilized by the Secretary of Information Broadcasting as Principal Accounting Officer PAO to supplement and support the publicity and projection efforts of the Government s development policies /action plan, and to counter negative propaganda which is against national interest, both within and outside the country. Since the expenditure incurred on such sensitive assignments cannot be met out of regular auditable budgetary allocation, all the previous governments in the past have been placing these funds at the disposal of this Ministry which is strictly utilized in accordance with the rules and regulations governing Secret Service Expenditure issued by the Finance Division from time to time. The fund has always been audited by various Finance Secretaries in the past as and when required as per regulations . 3. The Secret Service Fund was established since long most probably in the 70s. The allocation for specific assignments/projects was initiated sometimes in the 80s. Logically, it would not be possible to trace the record of last 30 years in order to find out as to when the fund was formally established. However, one of the documents traced indicate that the Bank Account was shifted from Muslim Commercial Bank, Civic Centre, Islamabad to National Bank of Pakistan, Model Branch, Islamabad in 1997. At present the Accounts are being maintained in the National Bank of Pakistan as per law. 5. The annual budget documents of the Finance Division titled Demands for Grant and Appropriations provides details of budget allocation out of FEDERAL GOVERNMENT S CONSOLIDATED FUND to each Ministry/Division/Department/rganization. The Finance Act 2012-13 which extends to whole of Pakistan in terms of Federal Government financial proposals gives legal effect to this authorized budget and its components including allocations under classified head of Secret Service Fund SSF of M/o I B. The said Act passed by the Parliament is duly assented by the President, authorizing each Minister Division including I B to incur expenditure as per allocation. Historically this fund has existed since 1947-50 onwards when the Federal Capital was located in Karachi. It has time tested authenticity and utility. 6 a . The AGPR s quarterly release of SSF to 1 B Division is always preceded by provision of Certificate of Expenditure for the earlier quarter, a copy of which is invariably sent to Directorate General of Audit in terms of Para37 of Appendix -8 of GFR Vol-Il, for its record and reference. 8. The salient aspects of the above brief, which represents the case of the Federation, can now be noted. It is not disputed that the Secret Service Fund is an allocation made under the Annual Budget Book titled Demand No.058. A self serving statement has been made that the Secret Service Fund is judiciously utilized by the Secretary of Information Broadcasting as Principal Accounting Officer. It has also been stated in the brief that the annual budget document of the Finance Division titled Demands for Grant of Appropriations provides details of budget allocations out of the Federal Government s Consolidated Fund to each Ministry/Division/Department/ Organization and these amounts including allocations are classified as Secret Service Fund. From this, it is 7 evident that the government has allocated funds to various Ministries, which funds or expenses therefrom are neither disclosed nor audited. One of the petitioners namely, Mr. Asad Kharal has stated in his CMA No. 5226 of 2013 that there are 27 Ministries to which funds have been allocated but which are neither audited nor disclosed to the public on the untenable plea that the same are secret. 9. What we also find surprising is that in the above referred brief, it is stated that the Secret Service Fund was established since long, most probably in the 70s emphasis provided . At another point in the brief, it has been stated contrary to this averment, that the Secret Service Fund is existing since 1947-50 onwards . When the above submissions are analyzed, it becomes evident that without any statutory or constitutional backing, Rule 37 5 of GFR cannot be legally sustained. If indeed, the Federal Government is seeking protection under the aforesaid Rule, this is not legally permissible because no justification or basis or source of Rule 37 5 of the GFR has been shown to us. Under the Constitution, in Articles 78 to 86 the financial procedure for the Federation s accounts has been clearly spelt out. The entire revenues of the Federation are either part of the Federal Consolidated Fund or the same are part of the Public Accounts of the Federation. There is no third account of the Federation. No part of the Consolidated Fund and the Public Accounts of the Federation, is exempted from audit under the Constitution. 10. We can now advert to two Statutes, which are of direct relevance to the issue before us; these are the Auditor General s Functions, Powers and Terms Conditions of Service Ordinance, 2001 and the Controller General of Accounts Appointment, Functions Powers Ordinance, 2001. It is quite clear from the submissions made by the learned Attorney General in Court today, that the provisions of Article 169 and 170 of the Constitution have not been taken note of by him nor is he aware of the existence of these statutes as is evident from his misguided reliance on Article 268 of the Constitution, noted above. Article 170 of the Constitution, it may be noted, was materially amended in 2010 through the 18 Amendment. The original Article was renumbered as sub-Article 1 and a new sub-Article 2 was added. The same being directly relevant is reproduced as under:- 8 2 The audit of the accounts of the Federal and of the Provincial Governments and the accounts of any authority or body established by, or under the control of, the Federal or Provincial Government shall be conducted by the Auditor-General, who shall determine the extent and nature of such audit . underlining for emphasis is ours 11. By virtue of the amended Article, the audit of accounts of the Federal and the Provincial Governments must be conducted by the Auditor General, who is also to determine the extent and nature of the said audit. The Constitution does not recognize any exception to the provisions of Article 170 2 ibid. In this view of the matter the Consolidated Fund and Public Accounts cannot remain unaudited. The provisions of the two statutes of 2001, which are relevant in this case, can now be examined. The terms of appointment in service of the Auditor General have been given in Section 4 of the Auditor General s Functions, Powers and Terms Conditions of Service Ordinance, 2001. It has also been expressly stipulated in section 7 of the statute that the Auditor-General shall on the basis of such audit as he may consider appropriate and necessary, certify the accounts, compiled and prepared by Controller-General of Account ... . Section 8 of the statute is also extremely relevant. It directs and mandates the Auditor General to audit all expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of the Federation ... and to ascertain whether the moneys shown in the accounts as having been disbursed were legally available for, and applicable to, the service or purpose to which they have been applied or charged and whether the expenditure conforms to the authority which governs it.... emphasis provided . Section 8 b of the statute requires the AuditorGeneral to audit all transactions of the Federation and of the Provinces relating to Public Accounts emphasis provided . It thus becomes abundantly clear that where the amount is charged on the Consolidated Fund or relates to the Public Accounts of the Federation or of the Provinces, the same must be audited by the Auditor-General without exception. 12. The powers of the Auditor General in connection with the audit of accounts have been given in Section 14 of the aforesaid statute. This legal provision stipulates that the Auditor-General shall, in connection with the performance of his duties under this Ordinance, have authority:-- a to inspect any office of the accounts, under the control of the Federation or of a Province ... b to require that any accounts, books, papers and other documents which deal with, or form, the basis of or otherwise relevant to the transactions to which his duties in respect of audit 9 extend, shall be sent to such place as he may direct for his inspection... . It is not necessary to reproduce the entire text of the aforesaid Ordinance or of the Controller General of Accounts Appointment, Functions Powers Ordinance, 2001 because the same are clear and do not exclude any amount forming part of the Consolidated Fund or the Public Account from audit. 13. As we have noted above sub-Article 2 of Article 170 of the Constitution was added by the 18 Amendment which amply empowers and directs the Auditor General to fulfill his constitutional obligation as watchdog of the people of Pakistan. It is only through audit that it can be ensured that the hard earned income of citizens of this country is being spent for lawful purposes. Without the audit specified by the Constitution and the two statutes, referred to hereinabove, there can be little or no room for any transparency. Absence of audit by the Auditor General, apart from being violative of the Constitution and law, is a sure and certain invitation to corruption and lack of accountability. 14. We have already noted in our judgment in Watan Party and others vs. Federation of Pakistan and others PLD 2012 SC 292 that Article 19A of the Constitution, which also has been added through the 18 Amendment, constitutes a major advance of fundamental rights and is essential for the effective functioning of democracy. In that judgment, we held that t he very essence of a democratic dispensation is informed choice. It is through such choice that the political sovereign, the People of Pakistan acquire the ability to reward or punish their elected representatives or aspirants to elected office, when it is time for the People to exercise their choice. If information on matters of public importance is not made available to citizens, it is obvious they will not have the ability to evaluate available choices. Information on matters of public importance thus, is a foundational bedrock of representative democracy and the accountability of chosen representatives of the people. It is in this context, both historical and conceptual, that the fundamental right to information has to be seen. It was noted that democracy itself becomes meaningless if the electorate is not provided the information, which can enable it to exercise its right to franchise on the basis of informed choice. It is through their choice that the electorate rewards good governance and punishes bad governance and maladministration. 10 15. The necessity for passing a detailed interlocutory order has arisen because our previous orders have neither been read nor complied with and the fundamental issues raised therein have not been addressed. We are concerned that without proper assistance on behalf of the Federation, it might suffer. We are, therefore, adjourning the matter to 9.5.2013 to enable the Federal Government to render proper assistance. We would also direct a senior functionary of the Auditor General s Office to be present in Court on the next date of hearing. Adjourned. To come up on 09.05.2013 for further hearing.

Finance Secretaries in the past as and when required as per regulations .", "The Secret Service Fund was established since long most probably in the 70s.", "The allocation for specific assignments/projects was initiated sometimes in the 80s.", "Logically, it would not be possible to trace the record of last 30 years in order to find out as to when the fund was formally established.", "However, one of the documents traced indicate that the Bank Account was shifted from Muslim Commercial Bank, Civic Centre, Islamabad to National Bank of Pakistan, Model Branch, Islamabad in 1997.", "At present the Accounts are being maintained in the National Bank of Pakistan as per law.", "The annual budget documents of the Finance Division titled Demands for Grant and

becomes evident that without any statutory or constitutional backing, Rule 37 5 of GFR cannot be legally sustained.", "If indeed, the Federal Government is seeking protection under the aforesaid Rule,

advert to two Statutes, which are of direct relevance to the issue before us; these are the Auditor General s Functions, Powers and Terms Conditions of Service Ordinance, 2001 and the Controller General of Accounts Appointment, Functions Powers Ordinance, 2001.", "It is quite clear from the submissions made by the learned Attorney General in Court today, that the provisions of Article 169 and 170 of the Constitution have not been taken note of by him nor is he aware of the existence of these statutes as is evident from his misguided reliance on Article 268 of the Constitution, noted

governs it.... emphasis provided .", "Section 8 b of the statute requires the AuditorGeneral to audit all transactions of the Federation and of the Provinces relating to Public Accounts emphasis

audited by the Auditor-General without exception.", "The powers of the Auditor General in connection with the audit of accounts have been given in Section 14 of the aforesaid statute.", "This legal

duties in respect of audit 9 extend, shall be sent to such place as he may direct for his inspection... .", "It is not necessary to reproduce the entire text of the aforesaid Ordinance or of the Controller General of Accounts Appointment, Functions Powers Ordinance, 2001 because the same are clear and do not exclude any amount forming part of the Consolidated Fund or the Public Account from

"Without the audit specified by the Constitution and the two statutes, referred to hereinabove, there can be little or no room for any transparency.", "Absence of audit by the Auditor General, apart

He further stated\nthat the principle mandate of such Government is to ensure free,\nfair and honest elections in the country by providing executive\nsupport and administrative assistance to the Election Commission\nof Pakistan. However, no sooner the elections are over and the\npeople of the country have spoken by means of vote, the\ndecisions/appointments/postings/transfers having the future\neffect should not have been made. He has placed reliance on the\nAustralian Guidance on Caretaker Conventions under the caption\n\n“Significant Appointments” which is reproduced herein below: -\n\n\"3.1 Governments defer making significant\nappointments during the caretaker period. When\nconsidering the advice it would give on whether an\nappointment qualifies as ‘significant’, the agency\nshould consider not only the importance of the\nposition, but also whether the proposed\nappointment would be likely to be controversial.\n\n3.2. If deferring the appointment is impracticable,\nusually for reasons associated with the proper\nfunctioning of an agency, there are several options:\n\ne the Minister could make an_ acting\nappointment where permissible;\n\ne the Minister could make a= short term\nappointment until shortly after the end of the\ncaretaker period; or\n\ne if those options are not practicable, the\nMinister could consult the relevant\n\nOpposition spokesperson regarding a full\nterm appointment.\n\n2. In this behalf, he has placed reliance upon the stance\ntaken by the learned Attorney General for Pakistan in another\nmatter pending before this Court. The same is reproduced herein\n\nbelow:\n\n12. That the federation is already on record in taking\nup a principled stand before this Hon’ble Court that\n\nConst.Petition No.30 of 2013.doc -3-\n\nthe care-taker government needs only to confine\ntheir work to ‘day to day’ routine matters and\neffectively maintain the status quo for the incoming\nelected government, while submitting the views of\nthe federation vide a CMA filed in Constitutional\nPetition Nos.14, 16 to 18 of 2013. It is submitted\nthat vide the said CMA the Attorney General\nsubmitted that the care-taker government should\navoid taking and controversial step and should not\ncommit any process that is not reversible by the\nincoming elected government and further that the\ncare-taker government should restrict itself to\nactivity that is a) routine, b) non-controversial, c)\nurgent and in public interest, d) reversible by the\nelected government; and e) any significant\nappointment thereby avoiding any major decisions\nexcept agreed to by the opposition.\n\n13. That the learned’ Attorney General whilst\npresenting the case of the federation in the\naforesaid constitutional petitions also relied upon\nAustralian Caretaker Conventions and highlighted\nthat the key elements of the code of conduct\nshould include: a) avoiding major policy decisions,\nb) avoiding any significant appointments, c) signing\nany major contract, d) avoiding international treaty\nor commitment, etc. It was in the same light that\nthe learned Attorney General submitted before this\nHon’ble Court that the care-taker government had\ndeferred some items of the Council of Common\nInterests (CCI) in a recently held meeting and was\nnot, therefore, making any binding\ndecisions/commitments with IMF, World Bank or\nany other donor agency and had further decided\nnot to enter into any binding agreement or treaty\nto bind the future elected government. It is\nsubmitted, therefore, that the — care-taker\ngovernment having earlier taken a principled stand\ncannot thereafter be allowed to recuse from the\nsame”.\n\n3. He has stated that the Caretaker Government has\nmade inter alia following transfers and postings in the civil\nservice, statutory bodies, autonomous or semi autonomous\n\nbodies, corporations and regulatory authorities :-\n\na. The Chairman of the National Highway Authority,\nHamid Ali Khan was replaced, on 16.05.2013, by\nSajjad Hussain Baloch;\n\nb. The Chairman NEPRA was replaced, on 16.05.2013,\nand Justice (R) Ahmad Khan Lashari has been\nappointed;\n\nc) The Managing Director SNGPL, Arif Hameed was\nreplaced, on 15.05.2013, by Amin Tufail;\n\nConst.Petition No.30 of 2013.doc -4-\n\nd) The Managing Director SSGCL was replaced, on\n15.03.2013, by Rahat Kamal Siddiqui;\n\ne) The Managing _ Director, Pakistan Mineral\nDevelopment Corporation, Khalid Khokhar was\nreplaced by Saifullah Khan;\n\nf) The Chairman, National Fertilizer, Rizwan Mumtaz\nAli was removed on 09.05.2013;\n\ng) The Managing Director, Oil and Gas Development\nCorporation, Masood Siddiqui was removed on\n06.05.2013;\n\nh) The Chairman, State Life Corporation was removed\non 16.05.2013;\n\ni) The Chairman, Pakistan Tourism Development\nCorporation has reportedly been removed and an\nanother appointed in his stead;\n\nD The Chairman, Pakistan Software Export Board has\nbeen removed and in his stead Saleem Ahmed\nRanjha has been appointed who is a direct inductee\nof Yusuf Raza Gillani the previous Prime Minister;\n\nk) The Director General, FIA who was appointed one\nmonth back is also reportedly in the process of\nbeing replaced;\n\n1) That certain employees/officers of the Pakistan\nTelecommunication Authority have reportedly been\nremoved from service without following the\nprocedure as set out under the relevant statute;\n\nm) That reportedly many other mid - level staff of\n\nsuch like aforesaid corporation/bodies have been\nshuffled/transferred/removed”.\n\n4. Notice of the petition was issued to the learned\nAttorney General for Pakistan, who appeared and stated that as\nfar as the stand taken by him before this Court in another\npetition, reference of which has been made in the paras\nreproduced hereinabove, is concerned, there is no cavil with the\nstand already taken by him therein, however, according to him\nthe Caretaker Government is not debarred under any provision of\n\nthe Constitution or the law to make the appointments, transfers\n\nConst.Petition No.30 of 2013.doc -5-\n\nand postings subject to availability of vacancies. He further\nstated that the appointments, transfers and postings have to be\nmade for the purpose of smooth running of those institutions\nwhere such indulgence/interference is shown because till the\ntaking over of the newly elected government, the process of\nfunctioning of such corporations etc. cannot be suspended or\nhalted for an indefinite period. He stated that as the factual\ncontroversy is involved in the matter, therefore, he has to seek\ninstructions from the Government in respect of the appointments,\ntransfers and postings which have been made by the Caretaker\nGovernment.\n\n5. We have heard the petitioner and the learned Attorney\nGeneral for Pakistan. It is to be noted that stand taken by the\npetitioner that the Caretaker Government is not to make\nappointments, postings and transfers against the vacancies\nhaving effect on the policies of the elected government, which is\nlikely to take over in a short while, seems to be convincing.\nInasmuch as, a Minister of the Caretaker Government has also\nobjected to such appointments. Reference in this behalf may be\nmade to a news item published in the daily Dawn dated 20\" May,\n2013, under the caption “Minister Objects to postings and\ntransfers”.\n\n6. It may not be out of place to note that Caretaker\n\nGovernment besides, making transfers and postings of above\n\nConst.Petition No.30 of 2013.doc -6-\n\nnoted positions, had also appointed Chairman of Anti-Dumping\nTribunal without realizing that there was no urgency in making\nthis appointment. In addition to it, there are reports that\nnotifications of the appointment of Federal Ombudsman and Tax\nOmbudsman are likely to be issued and against latter position\nKhawaja Siddique Akbar, Principal Secretary to Prime Minister, is\nto be appointed.\n7. We do allow the learned Attorney General for Pakistan\nto take instructions from the Government but in view of the\nimportance of the issue involved in the petition, we direct that;\nall the appointments, transfers and postings, which have\nbeen made by the Caretaker Government, referred to\nhereinabove, shall stand suspended and till pendency of this\npetition no further appointment, transfer and posting shall\nbe made by the Caretaker Government including the\nappointment of Federal Ombudsman, Tax Ombudsman and\nAnti-Dumping Tribunal, except the postings and transfers,\nwhich relate to day-to-day business of the government and\nare required to be made in the interest of State and also to\nwatch the interest of public, strictly following the rules and\nregulations on the subject, and in a transparent manner.\n8. Needless to observe that any individual, whose posting,\n\nappointment or transfer has been suspended and he is aggrieved\n\nConst.Petition No.30 of 2013.doc -7-\n\nfrom instant order, he/they may come forward by making\napplication(s), which shall be dealt with after hearing him/them.\n9. In the meanwhile, Secretary Establishment and Cabinet\nSecretary shall collect list of appointments, postings and transfers\nof government servants, heads of the statutory bodies, semi-\nstatutory bodies, regulatory authorities, etc., and shall place it on\nrecord for our perusal and passing appropriate orders, if need be.\n10. They are also directed to bring instant order in the\nnotice of the persons, whose designations have been noted\nhereinabove, so that he/they may approach the Court, if advised,\nfor resdressal of his/their grievance if any. In obscene of any\nobjection on his/their behalf, before the next date of hearing,\ncase shall proceed accordingly.\n\n11.

He further stated that the appointments, transfers and postings have to be made for the purpose of smooth running of those institutions where such indulgence/interference is shown because till the taking over of the newly elected government, the process of functioning of such corporations etc. cannot be suspended or halted for an indefinite period. He stated that as the factual controversy is involved in the matter, therefore, he has to seek instructions from the Government in respect of the appointments, transfers and postings which have been made by the Caretaker Government. 5. We have heard the petitioner and the learned Attorney General for Pakistan. It is to be noted that stand taken by the petitioner that the Caretaker Government is not to make appointments, postings and transfers against the vacancies having effect on the policies of the elected government, which is likely to take over in a short while, seems to be convincing. Inasmuch as, a Minister of the Caretaker Government has also objected to such appointments.

It may not be out of place to note that Caretaker Government besides, making transfers and postings of above Const.Petition No.30 of 2013.doc -6noted positions, had also appointed Chairman of Anti-Dumping Tribunal without realizing that there was no urgency in making this appointment. In addition to it, there are reports that notifications of the appointment of Federal Ombudsman and Tax Ombudsman are likely to be issued and against latter position Khawaja Siddique Akbar, Principal Secretary to Prime Minister, is to be appointed. 7. We do allow the learned Attorney General for Pakistan to take instructions from the Government but in view of the importance of the issue involved in the petition, we direct that; all the appointments, transfers and postings, which have been made by the Caretaker Government, referred to hereinabove, shall stand suspended and till pendency of this petition no further appointment, transfer and posting shall be made by the Caretaker Government including the appointment of Federal Ombudsman, Tax Ombudsman and Anti-Dumping Tribunal, except the postings and transfers, which relate to day-to-day business of the government and are required to be made in the interest of State and also to watch the interest of public, strictly following the rules and regulations on the subject, and in a transparent manner. 8. Needless to observe that any individual, whose posting, appointment or transfer has been suspended and he is aggrieved Const.Petition No.30 of 2013.doc -7from instant order, he/they may come forward by making application s , which shall be dealt with after hearing him/them. 9. In the meanwhile, Secretary Establishment and Cabinet Secretary shall collect list of appointments, postings and transfers of government servants, heads of the statutory bodies, semistatutory bodies, regulatory authorities, etc., and shall place it on record for our perusal and passing appropriate orders, if need be. 10. They are also directed to bring instant order in the notice of the persons, whose designations have been noted hereinabove, so that he/they may approach the Court, if advised, for resdressal of his/their grievance if any.

Abdul Ghafoor Lehri, appellant through the instant\nappeals, by way of leave of this Court vide order dated\n7.5.2013, calls in question the legality of the order dated\n18.4.2013 passed by a Full Bench of the High Court of\nBalochistan, Quetta in Constitution Petition No. 270 of 2013\nwhereby the same was dismissed against the order dated\n17.4.2013 passed by the Election Tribunal, Balochistan\nallowing the appeal against acceptance of nomination papers\n\nof the appellant.\n\n3. Succinctly, the facts forming background of the\ninstant appeals are that the appellant filed his nomination\npapers to contest general elections, 2013 scheduled to be\nheld on 11.5.2013 from PB-29-Naseerabad-II. The contesting\ncandidates, namely, Nazim-ud-Din Lehri, Ali Hassan Jamot,\nMuhammad Amin Umrani and Ahmad Bukhsh filed objections\nagainst the nomination of the appellant on the grounds that\nthe appellant while contesting the general elections held in\nthe year 2002 made different entries in his nomination papers\nqua his qualification on the basis of his Sanad which differ\nfrom the contents of nomination papers filed by him to\ncontest general election, 2013, as such, his act is in-violation\n\nof Article 62 and 63 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of\n\nC.As. 411 to 414/2013 3\n\nPakistan as he was not righteous, sagacious and Ameen in\nterms thereof. The other objection for not showing the\ncorrect evaluation of his land was also enforced. The learned\nReturning Officer on the day of scrutiny of nomination papers\nby overruling the objections filed by the respondents accepted\nthe nomination papers of the appellant declared him eligible\n\nto contest the elections, 2013.\n\n4. Feeling dissatisfied with the aforesaid orders of the\nlearned Returning Officer, the respondents filed election\nappeals before the learned Election Tribunal which were\nallowed. Consequently, the nomination papers of the\nappellant were rejected and he was declared ineligible to\ncontest general elections of 2013 and the Returning Officer\nwas directed to exclude his name from the list of validly\n\nnominated candidates.\n\n5. Feeling aggrieved by the aforesaid order, the\nappellant called in question the legality of the said order by\nfiling constitutional petitions Nos. 270, 271, 272 and 273 of\n2013 before the learned High Court of Balochistan, Quetta\nwhich were dismissed by the said court through short order\ndated 18.4.2013 and recorded reasons thereof on 6.5.2013.\nThe appellant still dissatisfied with the aforesaid judgment\nfiled civil petitions Nos. 505 to 508 of 2013 for leave to appeal\nchallenging the impugned judgment of the High Court of\n\nBalochistan, Quetta in which leave to appeal was granted\n\nC.As. 411 to 414/2013 4\n\ninter-alia to consider the question as to whether validly,\nissued degree/Sanad by a Deeni Madrassa which was not\nfound to be equivalent by the concerned University could\ndisqualify the appellant in terms of Article 62 (f)(i) of the\nConstitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973, to\n\ncontest the elections.\n\n6. Learned counsel for the appellant contends that\nthe order dated 18.4.2013 passed by the Full Bench of the\nHigh Court of Balochistan is against law and facts of the case;\nthat the learned Full Bench has misread and mis-appreciated\nthe material available on record; that the Returning Officer\nafter completing all codal formalities had rightly accepted his\nnomination papers but the learned Tribunal as well as the\nlearned High Court have illegally set aside order of the\nReturning Officer; that the appellant was duly qualified to\ncontest elections of 2013 as no condition of being graduate\nhas been imposed to contest general elections the same\nhaving been erased from the statute, as such, both the\nlearned Courts below have committed a patent illegality while\nupsetting well-reasoned order of the learned Returning Officer\naccepting the nomination papers of the appellant; that since\nthe appellant has neither committed any sinful act nor\ncheated the Court while producing a Sanad from Madrassa,\nas such, the conditions laid down by Article 62 of the\n\nConstitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 cannot be\n\nC.As. 411 to 414/2013 5\n\nimposed upon the appellant to declare him that he is not\nrighteous, sagacious or Ameen whereas the position is\notherwise and that since the appellant has been declared as\nreturned candidate after contest of general elections, 2013\nunder the orders of this Court, therefore, if the order\nimpugned in these proceedings is not set-aside, the voters of\nhis constituency will not only be deprived of their\nconstitutional right to choose a representative of their choice\nbut the constituency will also be left unattended/un-\nrepresented, in such circumstances, the impugned\n\njudgment/order is liable to be set aside.\n\n7. On the other hand learned counsel for the\nrespondents have vehemently opposed the contentions raised\nby the learned counsel for the appellant by contending that\nthe appellant while contesting election for the seat of Nazim\nheld in the year 2001 shown himself to be a matriculate and\ndid not describe in the nomination papers that he was holding\nSanad ul Fragh equivalent to B.A.; that the appellant passed\nSecondary School Examination (Matric) in the year 1983\nwhereas he is alleged to have obtained Sanad-ul-Fragh in the\nyear 1985, the question arises that when the appellant was\npossessing Sanad-ul-Fragh at the time of filing of nomination\npapers to contest Local Bodies election in the year 2001, why\nhe had not shown himself to be holder of Sanad-ul-Fragh.\n\nThus he cannot be said to be a righteous, sagacious and\n\nC.As. 411 to 414/2013 6\n\nAmeen within the meaning of Article 62 of the Constitution of\nIslamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 and was not eligible to\ncontest election; that the appellant after having been declared\nas a returned candidate on the basis of Sanad produced by\nhim before the Returning Officer to contest election in the\nyear 2002 was declared fake and forged, therefore, on the\nbasis of the said findings the appellant was debarred from\ncontesting elections of 2013 his candidature being hit by\nArticle 62 (f)(i) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of\nPakistan, 1973 as he, by his conduct, was not a righteous,\n\nsagacious or Ameen.\n\n8. We have heard arguments of learned counsel for\n\nthe parties and also gone through the available record.\n\n9. Admittedly, the appellant at the time of filing of\nnomination papers to contest Local Bodies election in the year\n2001, declared his qualification as Matric only but in the\ngeneral elections held in the year 2002, he produced a Sanad\nknown as Sanad-ul-Fragh allegedly issued by Madrassa Al-\nQuran-Ul-Arabia Behrul Uloom Qadria Abdullah Dahan\nShikarpur which according to the appellant was equivalent to\ngraduation. But, since the appellant while filing his\nnomination papers for contesting Local Bodies elections in the\nyear 2001 had disclosed his qualification as Matric and despite\nholding the said Sanad-ul-Fragh, non-mentioning of the said\n\nfact in his nomination papers to contest Local Bodies Election\n\nC.As. 411 to 414/2013 7\n\nin the year 2002 amounts to concealment of facts. Even\notherwise, the course for obtaining the said Sanad is normally\ncompleted within six years but after passing the matriculation\nexamination in the year 1983 how could it be possible for the\nappellant to pass the lengthy course within a short span of\ntwo years. Thus, genuineness of Sanad-ul-Fragh produced by\nhim to contest the general elections in the year 2002 creates\ndoubt in ones mind, the same being obtained without\n\ncompleting the educational course for the said Sanad.\n\n10. On the basis of the aforesaid Sanad his nomination\npapers were accepted and he was declared returned\ncandidate. However, his election was challenged by one\nMuhammad Sadiq Umrani by filing an election petition under\nsection 52 of the Representation of the People Act, 1976\nbefore the Election Tribunal alleging therein that the appellant\nwas not qualified to contest election as he did not possess\neducational qualification as provided by Article 8-A of the\nConduct of General Election Order, 2002 and the Sanad\nproduced by him alongwith his nomination papers was firstly\na bogus Sanad as he never studied in the Madrassa which\nissued the Sanad and secondly it was not equivalent to\nbachelor degree, the minimum qualification at the relevant\ntime provided for becoming member of the Provincial\nAssembly. The said election petition was contested by the\n\nappellant and the learned Election Tribunal on divergent\n\nC.As. 411 to 414/2013 8\n\npleadings of the parties framed as many as four issues. After\nrecording of the evidence of both the parties the learned\nElection Tribunal declared that the appellant was not qualified\nto contest election, as such, his election as member of the\nBalochistan Provincial Assembly from PB-29-Naseerabad-II\nBalochistan was declared void as a whole vide judgment\ndated 15.12.2003. The said findings of the learned Election\nTribunal were challenged by the appellant through an appeal\nin this Court which alongwith other appeals came up for\nhearing on 18.6.2009 when the same was disposed of having\nbecome infructuous by efflux of time. The Sanad produced by\nthe appellant while filing his nomination papers in the year\n2002 reveals that the same has been certified by the\nUniversity as an equivalent certificate to enable the persons\nholding said Sanad to seek admission in M.A. Arabic/Islamic\nCulture and was not at all equated with B.A. degree normally\nissued by the University. Article 8-A of the Conduct of General\nElection Order, 2002 permitted only those persons to contest\nelection of the Parliament or the Provincial Assembly who\nwere at least graduate or any degree equivalent to the\ngraduation and recognized by the University Grants\nCommission. The appellant at that time was not admittedly a\ngraduate within the meaning of Article 8-A of the Conduct of\nGeneral Election Order, 2002. It is also evident from the\nnotification issued on 25\" July, 2002, whereby the University\n\nGrants Commission accorded the requisite recognition and\n\nC.As. 411 to 414/2013 9\n\nequivalence to those Sanads only which were issued by the\n\ninstitutions mentioned in the said Notification, namely,\n\n11.\n\n10.\n\nWafaq-ul-Madaris,\nMarkazi Office Gordon Town Sher ShahRoad,\nMultan.\n\nTanzeem,-ul-Madaris Ahle-Sunnat, Jamia Naeemia\nRizvia, Garhi Shaho, Lahore.\n\nWafaq-ul-Madaris, Al-Salfia Hajiabad Post Code-\n38600, Faisalabad.\n\nWafaq-ul-Madaris Shia, Jamia-al-Muntazar, H.\nBlock Model Town, Lahore.\n\nRabita-ul-Madaris-Al-Islamia, Manzoor Road,\nLahore.\n\nJamia Islamia Minhaj-ul-Quran, 368 Model Town,\nLahore.\n\nJamia Taleemat-e-Islamia, Sargodha Road,\nFaisalabad.\n\nJamia Ashrafia, Ferozepur Road, Lahore.\n\nDarul Uloom Mohammadia Ghousia Bhera, District\nSargodha,\n\nDarul Uloom, Korangi, Karachi.\n\nAccording to the aforesaid list of the Madaris, the\n\nMadarassa which issued Sanad Fragh-ul-Uloom to the\n\nappellant does not figure anywhere in the said Notification\n\nand the University Grants Commission has restricted the\n\ngrant of requisite status and recognition to the Sanads\n\nawarded by the institutions mentioned supra and had not\n\nextended the same to the institutions affiliated therewith.\n\nFrom the aforesaid Notifications, it is clear that the Sanad\n\nC.As. 411 to 414/2013 10\n\nFragh-ul-Uloom issued by the aforesaid Madrissa was certified\nby Shah Abdul Latif University, Khairpur as an equivalent\ncertificate enabling the candidate to seek admission in M.A.\nArabic/Islamic Culture and such equivalence certificate cannot\nbe equated with B.A. degree normally issued by the University\nfor other disciplines. The said decision has been circulated by\nShah Abdul Latif University, Khairpur through circular dated\n23.8.2002. Since the University with which the Madrassa\nwhich issued the Sanad in question is affiliated itself notified\nthat the equivalence certificate cannot be equated with B.A.\ndegree, therefore, the appellant could not have contested the\nelection on the basis of said Sanad. This fact has already\nbeen taken note of by this Court in the case of Sanaullah\n\nKhan and others vs. District Returning Officer Mianwali_and\n\nothers (PLD 2005 S.C. 858) wherein it was held that UGC vide\nNotification No. 8-418/Acad/82/128 dated November 17,\n1982 declared that the Sanad of Shahadat-ul-Almiyya-fil-\nUloomil-Arabia-Wal-Islamia granted by a Deeni Madrassa\nwhose name finds mention therein shall be considered\nequivalent to M.A. in Arabic/Islamic Studies for the purpose of\nteaching Arabic/Islamic Studies in the colleges and\nUniversities and for pursuing higher studies in Arabic and\nIslamic Studies. However, for employment other than\nteaching, Sanad holders were required to qualify in two\nadditional subjects other than Arabic and Islamic studies at\n\nB.A. level of a University. They have also to qualify in the\n\nC.As. 411 to 414/2013 11\n\nnewly introduced subjects of Elective Pakistan Studies and\nIslamic Studies at the B.A. level. In such circumstances, it is\ncrystal clear as light of the day that as held by this Court in\nthe case referred supra the Sanad produced by the appellant\nwhile contesting election in the year 2002 was not at all equal\nto B.A. degree, thus, he was not qualified to be elected or\n\nchosen as a member of the Provincial Assembly.\n\n12. Since the Sanad produced by the appellant while\ncontesting election, 2002 has been declared not equivalent to\nB.A. degree for the reasons mentioned in the preceding\nparagraphs, therefore, appellant was not at all qualified to\ncontest election. Now the question arises as to whether the\nappellant is disqualified to contest election, 2013 or not. In\nthis regard it is noticed that while producing aforesaid Sanad,\nthe appellant sworn an affidavit to the effect that the Sanad\nproduced by him was issued to him by a recognized institution\nand equivalent to a bachelor degree made false statement\nand submitted false or incorrect declaration in respect of his\neducational qualification, thus, he was not _ righteous,\nsagacious, non-profligate, honest and Ameen within the\nmeaning of Article 62(f) of the Constitution of Islamic\nRepublic of Pakistan, 1973, as such, was not qualified to be\n\nelected or chosen as a member of Majlis-e-Shoora.\n\nC.As. 411 to 414/2013 12\n\n13. Since as per conclusions drawn by this Court in\n\nSanaullah_Khan’s case (supra) that the appellant knowingly\n\nand deliberately submitted a degree for becoming a\nparliamentarian which was not equivalent to B.A., therefore,\nhad not only committed an offence by doing so but also\ndefrauded the voters and the nation, as such, was disqualified\nto contest the election for not fulfilling the conditions\ncontained in Article 62(1)(d) and (f) of the Constitution of\nIslamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. This Court in the case of\n\nMalik_Iqbal Ahmad Langrial vs. Jamshaid_Alam_and_others\n\n(PLD 2013 SC 179) has held that a person who indulges into\nusing unfair means in procuring his educational qualifications\ndoes not deserve to claim to be an honest, righteous or\nAmeen person so that he be assigned the high responsibilities\nof performing national functions of running the affairs of the\ncountry. Relevant paras therefrom are reproduced\n\nhereinblow:-\n\n“10. ....It is to be noted that Article 62(1)(f), as\nit stood prior to 18th Constitutional Amendment,\nprovides that a person shall not be qualified to\nelected or chosen as a Member of Majlis-e-Shoora\n(Parliament) unless he is sagacious, righteous, non-\nprofligate, honest and ameen. It is clear from the\nplain reading of the said Article that there is no\nrestriction upon the Court/Tribunal to declare any\nperson to be not sagacious, righteous or ameen.\nAdmittedly the appellant used fake documents not\nonly in the year 2002 but also in the year 2008 and\n\nalso made false declaration making him liable to\n\nC.As. 411 to 414/2013 13\n\ncriminal action under certain provisions of P.P.C. In\nthe case of Muddasar Qayyum Nahra v. Ch. Bilal\nTjaz (2011 SCMR 80) this Court had upheld the\nfindings of Election Tribunal, Punjab whereby it\nwas held that a person who indulges into using\nunfair means in procuring his educational\nqualifications does not deserve to claim to be an\nhonest, righteous or Ameen person so that he be\nassigned the high responsibilities of performing\nnational functions of running the affairs of the\ncountry. The spirit with which the words sagacious,\nrighteous, non profligate, honest and Ameen have\nbeen used by the Constitution of Islamic Republic\nof Pakistan, 1973 for the eligibility of the\ncandidates contesting the elections of Members\nNational or Provincial Assembly cannot be allowed\nto be frustrated if persons who secure their\neducational documents through unfair means and\nare found guilty of such a condemnable act by the\ncompetent authority are allowed to be given entry\ninto the doors of National or Provincial Assemblies\nof our country. The respondent (therein) is thus not\nworthy of credence and cannot be allowed to be\nentrusted with State responsibilities of Law Making;\nto be in-charge of the National Exchequre or be\n\neligible to represent the people of Pakistan.”\n\n“12. In a recent case tiled as Syed Mehmood\nAkhtar Naqvi, v. Federation of Pakistan\n(Constitution Petition No.5 of 2012) this Court has\nheld that whoever makes false declaration at the\ntime of filing of nomination papers, makes himself\nliable to be disqualified from being elected or\nchosen as Member of the Majlis-e-Shoora\n(Parliament) or a Provincial Assembly for making\nmisstatement or concealment of fact, and also\nexposes himself to criminal proceedings\ncontemplated under sections 193, 196, 198 and\n199, P.P.C. “\n\nC.As. 411 to 414/2013 14\n\n14. In the instant case, the appellant has failed to\nmeet the criteria set out for proposed candidates under Article\n62(1) (d) & (f) of the Constitution and sub-sections (d), (e),\n(f) and (g) of section 99 of the Representation of People Act,\n1976. It may be noted that under Article 63 of the\nConstitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan there are\ncertain disqualifications which are of temporary nature and a\nperson disqualified under Article 63 can become qualified after\nlapse of certain period as mentioned therein, whereas, the\nrequirement of Article 62 are of permanent nature and a\nperson has to fulfill certain qualifications/conditions to become\neligible to be elected or chosen as a member of Majlis-e-\nShoora (Parliament), otherwise, he is not eligible to be a\nMember of Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament). For this reason\nalone, Article 62 does not provide any period after which a\nperson, who was declared disqualified under the said Article,\ncan be eligible to contest the elections of the Parliament. In\nsuch view of the matter we hold that a person who is not\nqualified under Article 62(1)(f) cannot become qualified by\nefflux of time. Reference in this regard may also be made to\n\nthe case of Imtiaz Ahmed Lali v. Ghulam Muhammad Lali (PLD\n\n2007 SC 369). In such circumstances the appellant has\nrightly been disqualified to be elected as member of the\nParliament by the learned Election Tribunal by allowing the\nelection appeal filed against acceptance of his nomination\n\npapers by the Returning Officer which findings were upheld by\n\nC.As. 411 to 414/2013 15\n\nthe High Court of Balochistan. In view of the facts and\ncircumstances of the case and the material available on\nrecord we are of the view that the findings of the learned High\nCourt are based on correct appreciation of evidence on record\nand the law on the subject.\n\n15. Even otherwise, the order, in the earlier round of\nlitigation, passed by the learned Election Tribunal accepting\nthe election petition filed by the contesting candidates qua\nelection 2002 and disqualifying the appellant to be the\nmember of the Parliament has attained finality for the reason\nthat although the appellant had challenged his disqualification\nbefore this Court by filing a civil appeal, yet, it was not\ndecided on merits and was disposed of having become\ninfructuous on the statement of learned counsel for the\nappellant. Since the appellant was not qualified to contest the\nelections, therefore, his success in the general elections held\nunder the stay order granted by this Court while granting\nleave to appeal, cannot be helpful to him as the question of\nhis disqualifications has to be decided by this Court in the\ninstant proceedings in continuation of rejection of his\nnomination papers and no premium of his success in the\nelection could be given to him as he was not qualified to\ncontest the election being not sagacious, righteous, non-\n\nprofligate and honest and Ameen.\n\nC.As. 411 to 414/2013 16\n\n16. For what has been discussed above, we find no\nmerit in these appeals which are hereby dismissed with costs.\nAs a sequel to the aforesaid findings, we set-aside the\nelection of PB-29-Naseerabad-II held on 11.5.2013 and direct\nthe Election Commission of Pakistan to hold fresh election in\n\nthe said constituency accordingly.\n\n17. These are the reasons of our short order of even\n\ndated announced in open Court.\n\nChief Justice\n\nJudge\nJudge\nIslamabad\n24\" May, 2013\n(Zulfiqar)\n\nNOT APPROVED FOR REPORTING", "CleanedText": "JUDGMENT IJAZ AHMED CHAUDHRY, J.- Through this single Judgment we intend to dispose of the civil appeals Nos. 411, C.As. 411 to 414/2013 2 412, 413 and 414 of 2013 as common questions of law and facts are involved in all of them and have arisen out of the same proceedings. 2. Abdul Ghafoor Lehri, appellant through the instant appeals, by way of leave of this Court vide order dated 7.5.2013, calls in question the legality of the order dated 18.4.2013 passed by a Full Bench of the High Court of Balochistan, Quetta in Constitution Petition No. 270 of 2013 whereby the same was dismissed against the order dated 17.4.2013 passed by the Election Tribunal, Balochistan allowing the appeal against acceptance of nomination papers of the appellant. 3. Succinctly, the facts forming background of the instant appeals are that the appellant filed his nomination papers to contest general elections, 2013 scheduled to be held on 11.5.2013 from PB-29-Naseerabad-II. The contesting candidates, namely, Nazim-ud-Din Lehri, Ali Hassan Jamot, Muhammad Amin Umrani and Ahmad Bukhsh filed objections against the nomination of the appellant on the grounds that the appellant while contesting the general elections held in the year 2002 made different entries in his nomination papers qua his qualification on the basis of his Sanad which differ from the contents of nomination papers filed by him to contest general election, 2013, as such, his act is in-violation of Article 62 and 63 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of C.As. 411 to 414/2013 3 Pakistan as he was not righteous, sagacious and Ameen in terms thereof. The other objection for not showing the correct evaluation of his land was also enforced. The learned Returning Officer on the day of scrutiny of nomination papers by overruling the objections filed by the respondents accepted the nomination papers of the appellant declared him eligible to contest the elections, 2013. 4. Feeling dissatisfied with the aforesaid orders of the learned Returning Officer, the respondents filed election appeals before the learned Election Tribunal which were allowed. Consequently, the nomination papers of the appellant were rejected and he was declared ineligible to contest general elections of 2013 and the Returning Officer was directed to exclude his name from the list of validly nominated candidates. 5. Feeling aggrieved by the aforesaid order, the appellant called in question the legality of the said order by filing constitutional petitions Nos. 270, 271, 272 and 273 of 2013 before the learned High Court of Balochistan, Quetta which were dismissed by the said court through short order dated 18.4.2013 and recorded reasons thereof on 6.5.2013. The appellant still dissatisfied with the aforesaid judgment filed civil petitions Nos. 505 to 508 of 2013 for leave to appeal challenging the impugned judgment of the High Court of Balochistan, Quetta in which leave to appeal was granted C.As. 411 to 414/2013 4 inter-alia to consider the question as to whether validly, issued degree/Sanad by a Deeni Madrassa which was not found to be equivalent by the concerned University could disqualify the appellant in terms of Article 62 f i of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973, to contest the elections. 6. Learned counsel for the appellant contends that the order dated 18.4.2013 passed by the Full Bench of the High Court of Balochistan is against law and facts of the case; that the learned Full Bench has misread and mis-appreciated the material available on record; that the Returning Officer after completing all codal formalities had rightly accepted his nomination papers but the learned Tribunal as well as the learned High Court have illegally set aside order of the Returning Officer; that the appellant was duly qualified to contest elections of 2013 as no condition of being graduate has been imposed to contest general elections the same having been erased from the statute, as such, both the learned Courts below have committed a patent illegality while upsetting well-reasoned order of the learned Returning Officer accepting the nomination papers of the appellant; that since the appellant has neither committed any sinful act nor cheated the Court while producing a Sanad from Madrassa, as such, the conditions laid down by Article 62 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 cannot be C.As. 411 to 414/2013 5 imposed upon the appellant to declare him that he is not righteous, sagacious or Ameen whereas the position is otherwise and that since the appellant has been declared as returned candidate after contest of general elections, 2013 under the orders of this Court, therefore, if the order impugned in these proceedings is not set-aside, the voters of his constituency will not only be deprived of their constitutional right to choose a representative of their choice but the constituency will also be left unattended/unrepresented, in such circumstances, the impugned judgment/order is liable to be set aside. 7. On the other hand learned counsel for the respondents have vehemently opposed the contentions raised by the learned counsel for the appellant by contending that the appellant while contesting election for the seat of Nazim held in the year 2001 shown himself to be a matriculate and did not describe in the nomination papers that he was holding Sanad ul Fragh equivalent to B.A.; that the appellant passed Secondary School Examination Matric in the year 1983 whereas he is alleged to have obtained Sanad-ul-Fragh in the year 1985, the question arises that when the appellant was possessing Sanad-ul-Fragh at the time of filing of nomination papers to contest Local Bodies election in the year 2001, why he had not shown himself to be holder of Sanad-ul-Fragh. Thus he cannot be said to be a righteous, sagacious and C.As. 411 to 414/2013 6 Ameen within the meaning of Article 62 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 and was not eligible to contest election; that the appellant after having been declared as a returned candidate on the basis of Sanad produced by him before the Returning Officer to contest election in the year 2002 was declared fake and forged, therefore, on the basis of the said findings the appellant was debarred from contesting elections of 2013 his candidature being hit by Article 62 f i of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 as he, by his conduct, was not a righteous, sagacious or Ameen. 8. We have heard arguments of learned counsel for the parties and also gone through the available record. 9. Admittedly, the appellant at the time of filing of nomination papers to contest Local Bodies election in the year 2001, declared his qualification as Matric only but in the general elections held in the year 2002, he produced a Sanad known as Sanad-ul-Fragh allegedly issued by Madrassa AlQuran-Ul-Arabia Behrul Uloom Qadria Abdullah Dahan Shikarpur which according to the appellant was equivalent to graduation. But, since the appellant while filing his nomination papers for contesting Local Bodies elections in the year 2001 had disclosed his qualification as Matric and despite holding the said Sanad-ul-Fragh, non-mentioning of the said fact in his nomination papers to contest Local Bodies Election C.As. 411 to 414/2013 7 in the year 2002 amounts to concealment of facts. Even otherwise, the course for obtaining the said Sanad is normally completed within six years but after passing the matriculation examination in the year 1983 how could it be possible for the appellant to pass the lengthy course within a short span of two years. Thus, genuineness of Sanad-ul-Fragh produced by him to contest the general elections in the year 2002 creates doubt in ones mind, the same being obtained without completing the educational course for the said Sanad. 10. On the basis of the aforesaid Sanad his nomination papers were accepted and he was declared returned candidate. However, his election was challenged by one Muhammad Sadiq Umrani by filing an election petition under section 52 of the Representation of the People Act, 1976 before the Election Tribunal alleging therein that the appellant was not qualified to contest election as he did not possess educational qualification as provided by Article 8-A of the Conduct of General Election Order, 2002 and the Sanad produced by him alongwith his nomination papers was firstly a bogus Sanad as he never studied in the Madrassa which issued the Sanad and secondly it was not equivalent to bachelor degree, the minimum qualification at the relevant time provided for becoming member of the Provincial Assembly. The said election petition was contested by the appellant and the learned Election Tribunal on divergent C.As. 411 to 414/2013 8 pleadings of the parties framed as many as four issues. After recording of the evidence of both the parties the learned Election Tribunal declared that the appellant was not qualified to contest election, as such, his election as member of the Balochistan Provincial Assembly from PB-29-Naseerabad-II Balochistan was declared void as a whole vide judgment dated 15.12.2003. The said findings of the learned Election Tribunal were challenged by the appellant through an appeal in this Court which alongwith other appeals came up for hearing on 18.6.2009 when the same was disposed of having become infructuous by efflux of time. The Sanad produced by the appellant while filing his nomination papers in the year 2002 reveals that the same has been certified by the University as an equivalent certificate to enable the persons holding said Sanad to seek admission in M.A. Arabic/Islamic Culture and was not at all equated with B.A. degree normally issued by the University. Article 8-A of the Conduct of General Election Order, 2002 permitted only those persons to contest election of the Parliament or the Provincial Assembly who were at least graduate or any degree equivalent to the graduation and recognized by the University Grants Commission. The appellant at that time was not admittedly a graduate within the meaning of Article 8-A of the Conduct of General Election Order, 2002. It is also evident from the notification issued on 25 July, 2002, whereby the University Grants Commission accorded the requisite recognition and C.As. 411 to 414/2013 9 equivalence to those Sanads only which were issued by the institutions mentioned in the said Notification, namely, 11. 10. Wafaq-ul-Madaris, Markazi Office Gordon Town Sher ShahRoad, Multan. Tanzeem,-ul-Madaris Ahle-Sunnat, Jamia Naeemia Rizvia, Garhi Shaho, Lahore. Wafaq-ul-Madaris, Al-Salfia Hajiabad Post Code38600, Faisalabad. Wafaq-ul-Madaris Shia, Jamia-al-Muntazar, H. Block Model Town, Lahore. Rabita-ul-Madaris-Al-Islamia, Manzoor Road, Lahore. Jamia Islamia Minhaj-ul-Quran, 368 Model Town, Lahore. Jamia Taleemat-e-Islamia, Sargodha Road, Faisalabad. Jamia Ashrafia, Ferozepur Road, Lahore. Darul Uloom Mohammadia Ghousia Bhera, District Sargodha, Darul Uloom, Korangi, Karachi. According to the aforesaid list of the Madaris, the Madarassa which issued Sanad Fragh-ul-Uloom to the appellant does not figure anywhere in the said Notification and the University Grants Commission has restricted the grant of requisite status and recognition to the Sanads awarded by the institutions mentioned supra and had not extended the same to the institutions affiliated therewith. From the aforesaid Notifications, it is clear that the Sanad C.As. 411 to 414/2013 10 Fragh-ul-Uloom issued by the aforesaid Madrissa was certified by Shah Abdul Latif University, Khairpur as an equivalent certificate enabling the candidate to seek admission in M.A. Arabic/Islamic Culture and such equivalence certificate cannot be equated with B.A. degree normally issued by the University for other disciplines. The said decision has been circulated by Shah Abdul Latif University, Khairpur through circular dated 23.8.2002. Since the University with which the Madrassa which issued the Sanad in question is affiliated itself notified that the equivalence certificate cannot be equated with B.A. degree, therefore, the appellant could not have contested the election on the basis of said Sanad. This fact has already been taken note of by this Court in the case of Sanaullah Khan and others vs. District Returning Officer Mianwali and others PLD 2005 S.C. 858 wherein it was held that UGC vide Notification No. 8-418/Acad/82/128 dated November 17, 1982 declared that the Sanad of Shahadat-ul-Almiyya-filUloomil-Arabia-Wal-Islamia granted by a Deeni Madrassa whose name finds mention therein shall be considered equivalent to M.A. in Arabic/Islamic Studies for the purpose of teaching Arabic/Islamic Studies in the colleges and Universities and for pursuing higher studies in Arabic and Islamic Studies. However, for employment other than teaching, Sanad holders were required to qualify in two additional subjects other than Arabic and Islamic studies at B.A. level of a University. They have also to qualify in the C.As. 411 to 414/2013 11 newly introduced subjects of Elective Pakistan Studies and Islamic Studies at the B.A. level. In such circumstances, it is crystal clear as light of the day that as held by this Court in the case referred supra the Sanad produced by the appellant while contesting election in the year 2002 was not at all equal to B.A. degree, thus, he was not qualified to be elected or chosen as a member of the Provincial Assembly. 12. Since the Sanad produced by the appellant while contesting election, 2002 has been declared not equivalent to B.A. degree for the reasons mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, therefore, appellant was not at all qualified to contest election. Now the question arises as to whether the appellant is disqualified to contest election, 2013 or not. In this regard it is noticed that while producing aforesaid Sanad, the appellant sworn an affidavit to the effect that the Sanad produced by him was issued to him by a recognized institution and equivalent to a bachelor degree made false statement and submitted false or incorrect declaration in respect of his educational qualification, thus, he was not righteous, sagacious, non-profligate, honest and Ameen within the meaning of Article 62 f of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, as such, was not qualified to be elected or chosen as a member of Majlis-e-Shoora. C.As. 411 to 414/2013 12 13. Since as per conclusions drawn by this Court in Sanaullah Khan s case supra that the appellant knowingly and deliberately submitted a degree for becoming a parliamentarian which was not equivalent to B.A., therefore, had not only committed an offence by doing so but also defrauded the voters and the nation, as such, was disqualified to contest the election for not fulfilling the conditions contained in Article 62 1 d and f of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. This Court in the case of Malik Iqbal Ahmad Langrial vs. Jamshaid Alam and others PLD 2013 SC 179 has held that a person who indulges into using unfair means in procuring his educational qualifications does not deserve to claim to be an honest, righteous or Ameen person so that he be assigned the high responsibilities of performing national functions of running the affairs of the country. Relevant paras therefrom are reproduced hereinblow:- 10. ....It is to be noted that Article 62 1 f , as it stood prior to 18th Constitutional Amendment, provides that a person shall not be qualified to elected or chosen as a Member of Majlis-e-Shoora Parliament unless he is sagacious, righteous, nonprofligate, honest and ameen. It is clear from the plain reading of the said Article that there is no restriction upon the Court/Tribunal to declare any person to be not sagacious, righteous or ameen. Admittedly the appellant used fake documents not only in the year 2002 but also in the year 2008 and also made false declaration making him liable to C.As. 411 to 414/2013 13 criminal action under certain provisions of P.P.C. In the case of Muddasar Qayyum Nahra v. Ch. Bilal Tjaz 2011 SCMR 80 this Court had upheld the findings of Election Tribunal, Punjab whereby it was held that a person who indulges into using unfair means in procuring his educational qualifications does not deserve to claim to be an honest, righteous or Ameen person so that he be assigned the high responsibilities of performing national functions of running the affairs of the country. The spirit with which the words sagacious, righteous, non profligate, honest and Ameen have been used by the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 for the eligibility of the candidates contesting the elections of Members National or Provincial Assembly cannot be allowed to be frustrated if persons who secure their educational documents through unfair means and are found guilty of such a condemnable act by the competent authority are allowed to be given entry into the doors of National or Provincial Assemblies of our country. The respondent therein is thus not worthy of credence and cannot be allowed to be entrusted with State responsibilities of Law Making; to be in-charge of the National Exchequre or be eligible to represent the people of Pakistan. 12. In a recent case tiled as Syed Mehmood Akhtar Naqvi, v. Federation of Pakistan Constitution Petition No.5 of 2012 this Court has held that whoever makes false declaration at the time of filing of nomination papers, makes himself liable to be disqualified from being elected or chosen as Member of the Majlis-e-Shoora Parliament or a Provincial Assembly for making misstatement or concealment of fact, and also exposes himself to criminal proceedings contemplated under sections 193, 196, 198 and 199, P.P.C. C.As. 411 to 414/2013 14 14. In the instant case, the appellant has failed to meet the criteria set out for proposed candidates under Article 62 1 d f of the Constitution and sub-sections d , e , f and g of section 99 of the Representation of People Act, 1976. It may be noted that under Article 63 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan there are certain disqualifications which are of temporary nature and a person disqualified under Article 63 can become qualified after lapse of certain period as mentioned therein, whereas, the requirement of Article 62 are of permanent nature and a person has to fulfill certain qualifications/conditions to become eligible to be elected or chosen as a member of Majlis-eShoora Parliament , otherwise, he is not eligible to be a Member of Majlis-e-Shoora Parliament . For this reason alone, Article 62 does not provide any period after which a person, who was declared disqualified under the said Article, can be eligible to contest the elections of the Parliament. In such view of the matter we hold that a person who is not qualified under Article 62 1 f cannot become qualified by efflux of time. Reference in this regard may also be made to the case of Imtiaz Ahmed Lali v. Ghulam Muhammad Lali PLD 2007 SC 369 . In such circumstances the appellant has rightly been disqualified to be elected as member of the Parliament by the learned Election Tribunal by allowing the election appeal filed against acceptance of his nomination papers by the Returning Officer which findings were upheld by C.As. 411 to 414/2013 15 the High Court of Balochistan. In view of the facts and circumstances of the case and the material available on record we are of the view that the findings of the learned High Court are based on correct appreciation of evidence on record and the law on the subject. 15. Even otherwise, the order, in the earlier round of litigation, passed by the learned Election Tribunal accepting the election petition filed by the contesting candidates qua election 2002 and disqualifying the appellant to be the member of the Parliament has attained finality for the reason that although the appellant had challenged his disqualification before this Court by filing a civil appeal, yet, it was not decided on merits and was disposed of having become infructuous on the statement of learned counsel for the appellant. Since the appellant was not qualified to contest the elections, therefore, his success in the general elections held under the stay order granted by this Court while granting leave to appeal, cannot be helpful to him as the question of his disqualifications has to be decided by this Court in the instant proceedings in continuation of rejection of his nomination papers and no premium of his success in the election could be given to him as he was not qualified to contest the election being not sagacious, righteous, nonprofligate and honest and Ameen. C.As. 411 to 414/2013 16 16. For what has been discussed above, we find no merit in these appeals which are hereby dismissed with costs. As a sequel to the aforesaid findings, we set-aside the election of PB-29-Naseerabad-II held on 11.5.2013 and direct the Election Commission of Pakistan to hold fresh election in the said constituency accordingly. 17. These are the reasons of our short order of even dated announced in open Court.

that the learned Full Bench has misread and mis-appreciated the material available on record; that the Returning Officer after completing all codal formalities had rightly accepted his nomination papers but the learned Tribunal as well as the learned High Court have illegally set aside order of the Returning Officer; that the appellant was duly qualified to contest elections of 2013 as no condition of being graduate has been imposed to contest general elections the same having been erased from the statute, as such, both the learned Courts below have committed a patent illegality while upsetting well-reasoned order of the learned Returning Officer accepting the nomination papers of the appellant; that since the appellant has neither committed any sinful act nor cheated the Court while producing a Sanad from Madrassa, as such, the conditions laid down by Article 62 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 cannot be C.As.", "411 to 414/2013 5 imposed upon the appellant to declare him that he is not righteous, sagacious or Ameen whereas the position is otherwise and that since the appellant has been declared as returned candidate after contest of general elections, 2013 under the orders of this Court, therefore, if the order impugned in these proceedings is not set-aside, the voters of his constituency will not only be deprived of their constitutional right to choose a representative of their choice but the constituency will also be left unattended/unrepresented, in such circumstances, the impugned judgment/order is liable to be set aside.", "On the other hand learned counsel for the respondents have vehemently opposed the contentions raised by the learned counsel for the appellant by contending that the appellant while contesting election for the seat of Nazim held in the year 2001 shown himself to be a matriculate and did not describe in the nomination papers that he was holding Sanad ul Fragh equivalent to B.A.", "; that the appellant passed Secondary School Examination Matric in the year 1983 whereas he is alleged to have obtained Sanad-ul-Fragh in the year 1985, the question arises that when the appellant was possessing Sanad-ul-Fragh at the time of filing of nomination papers to contest Local Bodies election in the year 2001, why he had not shown himself to be holder of Sanad-ul-Fragh.", "Thus he cannot be said to be a righteous, sagacious and C.As.", "411 to 414/2013 6 Ameen within the meaning of Article 62 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 and was not eligible to contest election; that the appellant after having been declared as a returned candidate on the basis of Sanad produced by him before the Returning Officer to contest election in the year 2002 was declared fake and forged, therefore, on the basis of the said findings the appellant was debarred from contesting elections of 2013 his candidature being hit by Article 62 f i of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 as he, by his conduct, was not a righteous, sagacious or Ameen.", "We have heard arguments of learned counsel for the parties and also gone through the available record.", "Admittedly, the appellant at the time of filing of nomination papers to contest Local Bodies election in the year 2001, declared his qualification as Matric only but in the general elections held in the year 2002, he produced a Sanad known as Sanad-ul-Fragh allegedly issued by Madrassa AlQuran-Ul-Arabia Behrul Uloom Qadria Abdullah Dahan Shikarpur which according to the appellant was equivalent to graduation.", "But, since the appellant while filing his nomination papers for contesting Local Bodies elections in the year 2001 had disclosed his qualification as Matric and despite holding the said Sanad-ul-Fragh, non-mentioning of the said fact in his nomination papers to contest Local Bodies Election C.As.", "411 to 414/2013 7 in the year 2002 amounts to concealment of facts.", "Even otherwise, the course for obtaining the said Sanad is normally completed within six years but after passing the matriculation examination in the year 1983 how could it be possible for the appellant to pass the lengthy course within a short span of two years.", "Thus, genuineness of Sanad-ul-Fragh produced by him to contest the general elections in the year 2002 creates doubt in ones mind, the same being obtained without completing the educational course for the said Sanad.", "On the basis of the aforesaid Sanad his nomination papers were accepted and he was declared returned candidate.", "However, his election was challenged by one Muhammad Sadiq Umrani by filing an election petition under section 52 of the Representation of the People Act, 1976 before the Election Tribunal alleging therein that the appellant was not qualified to contest election as he did not possess educational qualification as provided by Article 8-A of the Conduct of General Election Order, 2002 and the Sanad produced by him alongwith his nomination papers was firstly a bogus Sanad as he never studied in the Madrassa which issued the Sanad and secondly it was not equivalent to bachelor degree, the minimum qualification at the relevant time provided for becoming member of the Provincial Assembly.", "The said election petition was contested by the appellant and the learned Election Tribunal on divergent C.As.", "411 to 414/2013 8 pleadings of the parties framed as many as four issues.", "After recording of the evidence of both the parties the learned Election Tribunal declared that the appellant was not qualified to contest election, as such, his election as member of the Balochistan Provincial Assembly from PB-29-Naseerabad-II Balochistan was declared void as a whole vide judgment dated 15.12.2003.", "The said findings of the learned Election Tribunal were challenged by the appellant through an appeal in this Court which alongwith other appeals came up for hearing on 18.6.2009 when the same was disposed of having become infructuous by efflux of time.", "The Sanad produced by the appellant while filing his nomination papers in the year 2002 reveals that the same has been certified by the University as an equivalent certificate to enable the persons holding said Sanad to seek admission in M.A.", "Arabic/Islamic Culture and was not at all equated with B.A.", "degree normally issued by the University.", "Article 8-A of the Conduct of General Election Order, 2002 permitted only those persons to contest election of the Parliament or the Provincial Assembly who were at least graduate or any degree equivalent to the graduation and recognized by the University Grants Commission.", "The appellant at that time was not admittedly a graduate within the meaning of Article 8-A of the Conduct of General Election Order, 2002.", "It is also evident from the notification issued on 25 July, 2002, whereby the University Grants Commission accorded the requisite recognition and C.As.", "411 to 414/2013 9 equivalence to those Sanads only which were issued by the institutions mentioned in the said Notification, namely, 11.", "Wafaq-ul-Madaris, Markazi Office Gordon Town Sher ShahRoad, Multan.", "Tanzeem,-ul-Madaris Ahle-Sunnat, Jamia Naeemia Rizvia, Garhi Shaho, Lahore.", "Wafaq-ul-Madaris, Al-Salfia Hajiabad Post Code38600, Faisalabad.", "Wafaq-ul-Madaris Shia, Jamia-al-Muntazar, H.

Brief facts of the matter are that the petitioner has\nsubmitted nomination papers for contesting General Election\n2013 as a candidate from NA-237 Thatta-I. The respondent Peer\nTariq Ahmed filed objection on the nomination form contending\nthat the petitioner at the time of contesting previous election to\nthe seat of Provincial Assembly Sindh PS-84, Thatta-I, has filed\ndeclaration/affidavit and suppressed the fact of his being dual\nnational viz the nationality of Canada and thus he cannot be said\nto be a sadiq, ameen and righteous person and is disqualified to\ncontest the election under Article 62/63 of the Constitution. The\nlearned Returning Officer noted that the petitioner has filed a\ndeclaration while contesting election for the seat of PS-84,\nThatta-I, to the effect that he fulfils qualification under Article 62\nand was not disqualified under Article 63 of the Constitution and\non examining the record of Provincial Election Commissioner,\nSindh, found that petitioner is holding dual citizenship and on his\nasking from the petitioner’s counsel, the counsel admitted that at\nthe time of contesting previous election for the seat of PS-84,\nThatta-I, the petitioner has made a declaration in the said\nProvincial Election despite he being a foreign citizen of Canada.\n\nThe Returning Officer came to the conclusion that the case of the\n\nC.Ps.No.240 & 241 K of 2013.doc -3-\n\npetitioner is covered by disqualification under Article 63(1)(c) of\nthe Constitution and further concluded that he is neither honest\nnor a righteous persons and is hit by Article 62(f) of the\nConstitution and thus his form for candidature was rejected. The\nlearned Election Tribunal while considering the Election appeal of\nthe petitioner altogether ignored the finding of Returning Officer\nin respect of the petitioner earlier contesting the election of PS-\n84, Thatta-I, and making a false declaration with regard to\nholding of dual nationality by him at that time but confined itself\nto the fact that the petitioner has submitted an application for\ncancellation of his citizenship on 24.09.2012 and that the\nCanadian authorities vide letter dated 09.01.2013 have\ncommunicated the petitioner that he has ceased to be a Canadian\nnational w.e.f.11.12.2012 and since the petitioner has ceased to\nbe the Canadian national his nomination papers ought to have\nbeen accepted and the Returning Officer was directed to accept\nnomination papers of the petitioner. This order of the Election\nTribunal was challenged by Peer Tariq Ahmed so also by Abdul\nWahid Brohi, by two separate Constitution Petitions respectively\nD-1644 of 2013 and D-1721 of 2013 filed in the High Court of\nSindh at Karachi. It seems that Constitution Petition No.D-\n1644/2013 was taken up by the High Court on 18.04.2013 and\non the same day, an order was passed by which the said petition\n\nwas dismissed. In this order the High Court has observed that\n\nC.Ps.No.240 & 241 K of 2013.doc -4-\n\nrespondent No.4 has submitted that the petitioner was elected to\nSindh Assembly while he was holding dual nationality but failed to\ndemonstrate that petitioner ever made a declaration to the effect\nthat he did not hold dual nationality at the relevant time and\nrespondent No.4 has even failed to mention the date on which\nsuch declaration, if fact, was filed by the petitioner. It seems that\na review application was filed by respondent No.4 before the High\nCourt. The said review application along with Constitution\nPetition No.D-1721/2013 came up for hearing on 03.05.2013,\nwhen after hearing the learned counsel for the parties the Court\npassed an order on the same date whereby the review application\nwas allowed and the order dated 18.04.2013 passed in C.P.No.D-\n1644/2013 was recalled and both the petitions were disposed of\nby setting aside the order of the Election Tribunal. The High\nCourt also found as an admitted fact that at the time of\ncontesting the election of PS-84, Thatta-I, the petitioner has\nmade a false declaration and committed perjury by categorically\nmis-stating on Oath that he did not suffer from any\ndisqualification. Hence these petitions for leave to appeal.\n\n3. Mr. Rasheed A. Razvi, learned Sr. ASC has argued the\nmatter on behalf of the petitioner in both the petitions and has\ncontended that the provisions of Article 62 (1) (f) of the\nConstitution, is not self executory and that there has to be a\n\ndeclaration of the Court of law holding that the petitioner is not\n\nC.Ps.No.240 & 241 K of 2013.doc -5-\n\nsagacious, righteous, non-profligate, honest and ameen and there\nbeing no such declaration the petitioner’s nomination papers\ncould not have been rejected. In this respect, the learned\n\ncounsel has relied upon the case of Dr. Mobashir Hassan & others\n\nv. Federation of Pakistan & others (PLD 2010 Supreme Court\n\n265). The respondent Peer Tariq Anmed who has appeared in\nperson supported the impugned order while Mr. Faisal Kamal,\nlearned ASC appearing for respondent No.4 in C.P.No.241/2013\nwhile supporting the impugned order has also contended that the\nrunner up of the election be declared to be a_ successful\ncandidate.\n\n4. We have considered the submission of the learned\ncounsel and have gone through the record.\n\n5. In the present case, admittedly the petitioner has while\nfiling nomination papers for contesting By-Election of PS-84,\nThatta-I, in 2010, filed a declaration to the effect that he fulfils\nqualification specified in Article 62 of the Constitution and is not\nsubject to any disqualification specified in Article 63 of the\nConstitution. This declaration was made by the petitioner despite\nthe fact that he was holding dual nationality i.e. of Pakistan and\nalso of Canada and in terms of Article 63 (1) (c) of the\nConstitution on acquiring the citizenship of a foreign state, he\nstood disqualified from being elected or chosen as a Member of\n\nMajlis-e-Shoora or the Provincial Assembly. Reference in this\n\nC.Ps.No.240 & 241 K of 2013.doc -6-\n\nregard is made to the case of Syed Mehmood Akhtar Naqvi v.\n\nFederation of Pakistan through Secretary Law & others (PLD 2012\n\nSupreme Court 1089),\n\nfollows:-\n\nwherein this Court has observed as\n\n“The issue, whether a person holding citizenship of a\n\nforeign state is qualified to contest the election or not,\n\nhad come for consideration before the Lahore High Court,\n\nin the case of Umar Ahmad Ghumman v. Government of\n\nPakistan and others (PLD 2002 Lahore 521), wherein a\n\nlearned Judge of this Court, Hon’ble Mr. Justice Tassaduq\n\nHussain Jillani, as a Judge of the Lahore High Court, held\n\nthat :--\n\n\"38. The contention of the petitioner’s learned\ncounsel was that the petitioner is qualified to\ncontest the general election for the membership of\nthe Parliament in terms of Article 62 of the\nConstitution which pertains to qualifications for a\nmember of the Parliament. According to learned\ncounsel for the petitioner, in absence of any bar for\na dual national prescribed in Article 62 of the\nConstitution, petitioner is qualified to contest the\nelections and that the disqualification enumerated\nin Article 63(1)(c) of the Constitution comes into\nforce only when a person has been elected as\nMember of the Parliament.\n\n39. The above interpretation of the\nConstitutional provisions is a_ rather over\nsimplification and would lead to anomalous results.\nArticle 63(1)(c) of the Constitution explicitly\nmandates that “a person shall be disqualified from\nbeing elected or chosen as, and from being, a\nmember of the Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament), if he\nceases to be a citizen of Pakistan, or acquires the\ncitizenship of a_ foreign State”. Thus the\ndisqualification comes into play the moment a\nperson becomes a candidate or seeks election.\nThis Court has declared petitioner to be a citizen of\n\nPakistan but every citizen of a State is not allowed\n\nC.Ps.No.240 & 241 K of 2013.doc -7-\n\nto contest the election. The qualifications and\ndisqualifications have been enumerated in the\nConstitution and by the law of the land. Since the\npetitioner has admittedly acquired citizenship of a\nforeign country, he is hit by the afore-referred\nprovision and cannot contest elections unless, of\ncourse, he removes this disqualification in terms of\nrule 19 of the Pakistan Citizenship Rules, 1952”.\n\n6. The matter regarding making of a false declaration by a\ncandidate contesting the election for National Assembly or the\nProvincial Assembly in respect of education qualification came to\nbe considered by this Court in the case reported as Malik Iqbal\n\nAhmad Langrial v. Jamshed Alam & others (PLD 2013 Supreme\n\nCourt 179), wherein the Court has observed as follows:-\n\n“Learned counsel for the appellant has vehemently\nargued that prior to 18 Constitutional Amendment, in\nterms of Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution, the Court\nwas not empowered to declare any person to be non-\nsagacious, not righteous or honest or an ameen, as such\nthe observations of the Election Tribunal that the\nappellant was not only to contest the election in the year\n2008, but was also not righteous or honest or an ameen\nperson, was sustainable. In this regard it is to be noted\nthat at the time of filing of nomination papers to contest\nthe election in the year 2002, the appellant produced fake\nand forged education certificates and the Election Tribunal\nhad declared him to be a impostor vide judgment dated\n26.12.2002. It is to be noted that Article 62(1)(f), as it\nstood prior to 18 Constitutional Amendment, provides\nthat a person shall not be qualified to elected or chosen\nas a Member of Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament) unless he is\nsagacious, righteous, non-profligate, honest and ameen.\nIt is clear from the plain reading of the said Article that\nthere is no restriction upon the Court/Tribunal to declare\nany person to be not sagacious, righteous or ameen.\n\nAdmittedly the appellant used fake documents not only in\n\nC.Ps.No.240 & 241 K of 2013.doc -8-\n\nthe year 2002 but also in the year 2008 and also made\nfalse declaration making him liable to criminal action\nunder certain provisions of PPC. In the case of Muddasar\nQayyum Nahra_ v. Ch. Bilal Ijaz (2011 SCMR 80) this\nCourt had upheld the findings of Election Tribunal, Punjab\n\nwhereby it was held that a person who indulges into using\nunfair means in procuring his educational qualifications\ndoes not deserve to claim to be an honest, righteous or\nAmeen person so that he be assigned the high\nresponsibilities of performing national functions of running\nthe affairs of the country. The spirit with which the words\nsagacious, righteous, non profligate, honest and Ameen\nhave been used by the Constitution of Islamic Republic of\nPakistan, 1973, for the eligibility of the candidates\ncontesting the election of Members National or Provincial\nAssembly cannot be allowed to be frustrated if persons\nwho secure their educational documents through unfair\nmeans and are found guilty of such a condemnable act by\nthe competent authority are allowed to be given entry\ninto the doors of National or Provincial Assemblies of our\ncountry. The respondent (therein) is thus not worthy of\ncredence and cannot be allowed to be entrusted with\nState responsibilities of Law Making; to be in-charge of\nthe National Exchequer or be eligible to represent the\n\npeople of Pakistan”.\n\nIn our view, the test of declaration of sagacious, righteous, non-\nprofligate, honest and ameen as laid down in the above cited case\nin respect of educational qualification can equally be applied to\n\nthe case of holding of dual nationality with the same result.\n\n7. In the case reported as Imtiaz Ahmed Lali v. Ghulam\n\nMuhammad Lali (PLD 2007 Supreme Court 369), this Court has\n\nheld that disqualification once earned by a candidate, in view of\nthe provisions of the Constitution and law, cannot be removed by\n\na flux of time. Keeping in view above state of law, it becomes\n\nC.Ps.No.240 & 241 K of 2013.doc -9-\n\napparent that while contesting the election for the Provincial\nAssembly PS-84, Thatta-I, the petitioner has filed a declaration,\nwhich on its face was a false and untrue declaration which will\nbring into application the provision of Article 62 (1) (f) of the\nConstitution that he is not a sagacious, righteous, non-profligate,\nhonest and ameen. This being admitted position on the record\nwhich fact was also admitted by the learned counsel for the\npetitioner during the course of hearing.\n\n8. It was argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner\nthat the impugned order having been passed by the High Court,\nthe petitioner applied for its suspension on the ground that the\npetitioner proposes to challenge the impugned order before this\nCourt and the High Court vide order dated 09.05.2013 suspended\nthe operation of the impugned order till 16.05.2013 and the\npetitioner having contested the election on 11.05.2013 has\nobtained highest number of votes from his constituency and by\ndismissing this petition it will literally amount to de-seating the\npetitioner. We are afraid that this submission has no force for\nthat the petitioner was suffering from disqualification from\nentering into election process and this was so held by the High\nCourt in the impugned order and it was only on the request of the\npetitioner that such an order was suspended for the period upto\n\n16.05.2013. This eventuality will not make either the impugned\n\nC.Ps.No.240 & 241 K of 2013.doc -10-\n\norder of the High Court redundant or the disqualification suffered\nby the petitioner would be legitimized.\n\n9. Thus we hold that the petitioner was not qualified to\ncontest the General Election of 2013 and that his contesting of\nelection from NA-237, Thatta-I, is of no consequence and the\nsame are set-aside. Mr. Faisal Kamal, learned counsel for\nrespondent No.4, in C.P.No.241-K/2013 has contended that in the\nwake of election of petitioner being set-aside, the runner up\ncandidate namely Syed Riaz Hussain Shah Sheerazi be declared\nas a successful candidate. We are afraid that we cannot pass\nsuch declaration and that in any event it seems that the Election\nCommission of Pakistan will have to hold fresh election of\nNA-237, Thatta-I, and it is directed accordingly. These petitions\n\nwere dismissed by the following short order: -\n\n“For reasons to be recorded later, the listed petitions are\ndismissed with all consequences with cost of Rs.50,000/-\nin each case, which shall be paid to Peer Tariq Ahmed,\nthe objector.

These two Civil Petitions for leave to appeal have been filed against a common order dated 03.05.2013 passed by a learned 3 Member Bench of the High Court of Sindh at Karachi, by which the two Constitution Petitions C.Ps.No.D1644 D-1721 of 2013 were disposed of setting aside the order dated 13.04.2013 passed by the Election Tribunal and C.Ps.No.240 241 K of 2013.doc -2consequently maintaining the order dated 06.04.2013 of the Returning Officer rejecting the nomination papers of the petitioner. 2. Brief facts of the matter are that the petitioner has submitted nomination papers for contesting General Election 2013 as a candidate from NA-237 Thatta-I. The respondent Peer Tariq Ahmed filed objection on the nomination form contending that the petitioner at the time of contesting previous election to the seat of Provincial Assembly Sindh PS-84, Thatta-I, has filed declaration/affidavit and suppressed the fact of his being dual national viz the nationality of Canada and thus he cannot be said to be a sadiq, ameen and righteous person and is disqualified to contest the election under Article 62/63 of the Constitution. The learned Returning Officer noted that the petitioner has filed a declaration while contesting election for the seat of PS-84, Thatta-I, to the effect that he fulfils qualification under Article 62 and was not disqualified under Article 63 of the Constitution and on examining the record of Provincial Election Commissioner, Sindh, found that petitioner is holding dual citizenship and on his asking from the petitioner s counsel, the counsel admitted that at the time of contesting previous election for the seat of PS-84, Thatta-I, the petitioner has made a declaration in the said Provincial Election despite he being a foreign citizen of Canada. The Returning Officer came to the conclusion that the case of the C.Ps.No.240 241 K of 2013.doc -3petitioner is covered by disqualification under Article 63 1 c of the Constitution and further concluded that he is neither honest nor a righteous persons and is hit by Article 62 f of the Constitution and thus his form for candidature was rejected. The learned Election Tribunal while considering the Election appeal of the petitioner altogether ignored the finding of Returning Officer in respect of the petitioner earlier contesting the election of PS84, Thatta-I, and making a false declaration with regard to holding of dual nationality by him at that time but confined itself to the fact that the petitioner has submitted an application for cancellation of his citizenship on 24.09.2012 and that the Canadian authorities vide letter dated 09.01.2013 have communicated the petitioner that he has ceased to be a Canadian national w.e.f.11.12.2012 and since the petitioner has ceased to be the Canadian national his nomination papers ought to have been accepted and the Returning Officer was directed to accept nomination papers of the petitioner. This order of the Election Tribunal was challenged by Peer Tariq Ahmed so also by Abdul Wahid Brohi, by two separate Constitution Petitions respectively D-1644 of 2013 and D-1721 of 2013 filed in the High Court of Sindh at Karachi. It seems that Constitution Petition No.D1644/2013 was taken up by the High Court on 18.04.2013 and on the same day, an order was passed by which the said petition was dismissed. In this order the High Court has observed that C.Ps.No.240 241 K of 2013.doc -4respondent No.4 has submitted that the petitioner was elected to Sindh Assembly while he was holding dual nationality but failed to demonstrate that petitioner ever made a declaration to the effect that he did not hold dual nationality at the relevant time and respondent No.4 has even failed to mention the date on which such declaration, if fact, was filed by the petitioner. It seems that a review application was filed by respondent No.4 before the High Court. The said review application along with Constitution Petition No.D-1721/2013 came up for hearing on 03.05.2013, when after hearing the learned counsel for the parties the Court passed an order on the same date whereby the review application was allowed and the order dated 18.04.2013 passed in C.P.No.D1644/2013 was recalled and both the petitions were disposed of by setting aside the order of the Election Tribunal. The High Court also found as an admitted fact that at the time of contesting the election of PS-84, Thatta-I, the petitioner has made a false declaration and committed perjury by categorically mis-stating on Oath that he did not suffer from any disqualification. Hence these petitions for leave to appeal. 3. Mr. Rasheed A. Razvi, learned Sr. ASC has argued the matter on behalf of the petitioner in both the petitions and has contended that the provisions of Article 62 1 f of the Constitution, is not self executory and that there has to be a declaration of the Court of law holding that the petitioner is not C.Ps.No.240 241 K of 2013.doc -5sagacious, righteous, non-profligate, honest and ameen and there being no such declaration the petitioner s nomination papers could not have been rejected. In this respect, the learned counsel has relied upon the case of Dr. Mobashir Hassan others v. Federation of Pakistan others PLD 2010 Supreme Court 265 . The respondent Peer Tariq Anmed who has appeared in person supported the impugned order while Mr. Faisal Kamal, learned ASC appearing for respondent No.4 in C.P.No.241/2013 while supporting the impugned order has also contended that the runner up of the election be declared to be a successful candidate. 4. We have considered the submission of the learned counsel and have gone through the record. 5. In the present case, admittedly the petitioner has while filing nomination papers for contesting By-Election of PS-84, Thatta-I, in 2010, filed a declaration to the effect that he fulfils qualification specified in Article 62 of the Constitution and is not subject to any disqualification specified in Article 63 of the Constitution. This declaration was made by the petitioner despite the fact that he was holding dual nationality i.e. of Pakistan and also of Canada and in terms of Article 63 1 c of the Constitution on acquiring the citizenship of a foreign state, he stood disqualified from being elected or chosen as a Member of Majlis-e-Shoora or the Provincial Assembly. Reference in this C.Ps.No.240 241 K of 2013.doc -6regard is made to the case of Syed Mehmood Akhtar Naqvi v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Law others PLD 2012 Supreme Court 1089 , follows:- wherein this Court has observed as The issue, whether a person holding citizenship of a foreign state is qualified to contest the election or not, had come for consideration before the Lahore High Court, in the case of Umar Ahmad Ghumman v. Government of Pakistan and others PLD 2002 Lahore 521 , wherein a learned Judge of this Court, Hon ble Mr. Justice Tassaduq Hussain Jillani, as a Judge of the Lahore High Court, held that :-- 38. The contention of the petitioner s learned counsel was that the petitioner is qualified to contest the general election for the membership of the Parliament in terms of Article 62 of the Constitution which pertains to qualifications for a member of the Parliament. According to learned counsel for the petitioner, in absence of any bar for a dual national prescribed in Article 62 of the Constitution, petitioner is qualified to contest the elections and that the disqualification enumerated in Article 63 1 c of the Constitution comes into force only when a person has been elected as Member of the Parliament. 39. The above interpretation of the Constitutional provisions is a rather over simplification and would lead to anomalous results. Article 63 1 c of the Constitution explicitly mandates that a person shall be disqualified from being elected or chosen as, and from being, a member of the Majlis-e-Shoora Parliament , if he ceases to be a citizen of Pakistan, or acquires the citizenship of a foreign State . Thus the disqualification comes into play the moment a person becomes a candidate or seeks election. This Court has declared petitioner to be a citizen of Pakistan but every citizen of a State is not allowed C.Ps.No.240 241 K of 2013.doc -7to contest the election. The qualifications and disqualifications have been enumerated in the Constitution and by the law of the land. Since the petitioner has admittedly acquired citizenship of a foreign country, he is hit by the afore-referred provision and cannot contest elections unless, of course, he removes this disqualification in terms of rule 19 of the Pakistan Citizenship Rules, 1952 . 6. The matter regarding making of a false declaration by a candidate contesting the election for National Assembly or the Provincial Assembly in respect of education qualification came to be considered by this Court in the case reported as Malik Iqbal Ahmad Langrial v. Jamshed Alam others PLD 2013 Supreme Court 179 , wherein the Court has observed as follows:- Learned counsel for the appellant has vehemently argued that prior to 18 Constitutional Amendment, in terms of Article 62 1 f of the Constitution, the Court was not empowered to declare any person to be nonsagacious, not righteous or honest or an ameen, as such the observations of the Election Tribunal that the appellant was not only to contest the election in the year 2008, but was also not righteous or honest or an ameen person, was sustainable. In this regard it is to be noted that at the time of filing of nomination papers to contest the election in the year 2002, the appellant produced fake and forged education certificates and the Election Tribunal had declared him to be a impostor vide judgment dated 26.12.2002. It is to be noted that Article 62 1 f , as it stood prior to 18 Constitutional Amendment, provides that a person shall not be qualified to elected or chosen as a Member of Majlis-e-Shoora Parliament unless he is sagacious, righteous, non-profligate, honest and ameen. It is clear from the plain reading of the said Article that there is no restriction upon the Court/Tribunal to declare any person to be not sagacious, righteous or ameen. Admittedly the appellant used fake documents not only in C.Ps.No.240 241 K of 2013.doc -8the year 2002 but also in the year 2008 and also made false declaration making him liable to criminal action under certain provisions of PPC. In the case of Muddasar Qayyum Nahra v. Ch. Bilal Ijaz 2011 SCMR 80 this Court had upheld the findings of Election Tribunal, Punjab whereby it was held that a person who indulges into using unfair means in procuring his educational qualifications does not deserve to claim to be an honest, righteous or Ameen person so that he be assigned the high responsibilities of performing national functions of running the affairs of the country. The spirit with which the words sagacious, righteous, non profligate, honest and Ameen have been used by the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, for the eligibility of the candidates contesting the election of Members National or Provincial Assembly cannot be allowed to be frustrated if persons who secure their educational documents through unfair means and are found guilty of such a condemnable act by the competent authority are allowed to be given entry into the doors of National or Provincial Assemblies of our country. The respondent therein is thus not worthy of credence and cannot be allowed to be entrusted with State responsibilities of Law Making; to be in-charge of the National Exchequer or be eligible to represent the people of Pakistan . In our view, the test of declaration of sagacious, righteous, nonprofligate, honest and ameen as laid down in the above cited case in respect of educational qualification can equally be applied to the case of holding of dual nationality with the same result. 7. In the case reported as Imtiaz Ahmed Lali v. Ghulam Muhammad Lali PLD 2007 Supreme Court 369 , this Court has held that disqualification once earned by a candidate, in view of the provisions of the Constitution and law, cannot be removed by a flux of time. Keeping in view above state of law, it becomes C.Ps.No.240 241 K of 2013.doc -9apparent that while contesting the election for the Provincial Assembly PS-84, Thatta-I, the petitioner has filed a declaration, which on its face was a false and untrue declaration which will bring into application the provision of Article 62 1 f of the Constitution that he is not a sagacious, righteous, non-profligate, honest and ameen. This being admitted position on the record which fact was also admitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner during the course of hearing. 8. It was argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the impugned order having been passed by the High Court, the petitioner applied for its suspension on the ground that the petitioner proposes to challenge the impugned order before this Court and the High Court vide order dated 09.05.2013 suspended the operation of the impugned order till 16.05.2013 and the petitioner having contested the election on 11.05.2013 has obtained highest number of votes from his constituency and by dismissing this petition it will literally amount to de-seating the petitioner. We are afraid that this submission has no force for that the petitioner was suffering from disqualification from entering into election process and this was so held by the High Court in the impugned order and it was only on the request of the petitioner that such an order was suspended for the period upto 16.05.2013. This eventuality will not make either the impugned C.Ps.No.240 241 K of 2013.doc -10order of the High Court redundant or the disqualification suffered by the petitioner would be legitimized. 9. Thus we hold that the petitioner was not qualified to contest the General Election of 2013 and that his contesting of election from NA-237, Thatta-I, is of no consequence and the same are set-aside. Mr. Faisal Kamal, learned counsel for respondent No.4, in C.P.No.241-K/2013 has contended that in the wake of election of petitioner being set-aside, the runner up candidate namely Syed Riaz Hussain Shah Sheerazi be declared as a successful candidate. We are afraid that we cannot pass such declaration and that in any event it seems that the Election Commission of Pakistan will have to hold fresh election of NA-237, Thatta-I, and it is directed accordingly. These petitions were dismissed by the following short order: - For reasons to be recorded later, the listed petitions are dismissed with all consequences with cost of Rs.50,000/- in each case, which shall be paid to Peer Tariq Ahmed, the objector. The cost shall be deposited with the Registrar of this Court within three days from where the same shall be withdrawn by the objector against the valid receipt . 10.

As in CMAs 2991 & 3015 of 2013 in Constitution Petition\nNo.23 of 2012 identical issues about appointments, transfers and\npostings, etc., were raised, therefore, a learned Bench of this Court,\nvide order dated 28.05.2013, referred the said miscellaneous\napplications to this Bench, to avoid overlapping of the proceedings\nand/or the possibility of rendering of conflicting judgments on similar\nissues in the event of parallel proceedings being conducted in two\ndifferent benches simultaneously.\n3. On 22.05.2013 and 04.06.2013, orders were passed and\nthe Secretaries of the concerned Ministries/Divisions of the Federal\nGovernment were called upon to furnish details of the Government\nservants/employees, who were appointed, transferred, posted, etc.\nRelevant paras there from are reproduced hereinbelow respectively: -\nOrder dated 22.05.2013\n“3. He has stated that the Caretaker Government has\nmade inter alia following transfers and postings in the civil\nservice, statutory bodies, autonomous or semi autonomous\nbodies, corporations and regulatory authorities :-\na) The Chairman of the National Highway Authority, Hamid\nAli Khan was replaced, on 16.05.2013, by Sajjad Hussain\nBaloch;\nb) The Chairman NEPRA was replaced, on 16.05.2013, and\nJustice (R) Ahmad Khan Lashari has been appointed;\nc) The Managing Director SNGPL, Arif Hameed was replaced,\non 15.05.2013, by Amin Tufail;\n\nd) The Managing Director SSGCL was replaced, on\n15.03.2013, by Rahat Kamal Siddiqui;\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc.\n\n6\ne) The Managing Director, Pakistan Mineral Development\nCorporation, Khalid Khokhar was replaced by Saifullah\nKhan;\nf) The Chairman, National Fertilizer, Rizwan Mumtaz Ali was\n\nremoved on 09.05.2013;\ng) The Managing Director, Oil and Gas Development\nCorporation, Masood Siddiqui was removed on\n\n06.05.2013;\n\nh) The Chairman, State Life Corporation was removed on\n16.05.2013;\n\ni) The Chairman, Pakistan Tourism Development\n\nCorporation has reportedly been removed and an another\nappointed in his stead;\n\nD The Chairman, Pakistan Software Export Board has been\nremoved and in his stead Saleem Ahmed Ranjha has been\nappointed who is a direct inductee of Yusuf Raza Gillani\nthe previous Prime Minister;\n\nk) The Director General, FIA who was appointed one month\nback is also reportedly in the process of being replaced;\n1) That certain employees/officers of the Pakistan\n\nTelecommunication Authority have reportedly been\nremoved from service without following the procedure as\nset out under the relevant statute;\n\nm) That reportedly many other mid - level staff of such like\naforesaid corporation/bodies have been — shuffled/\ntransferred/removed”.\n\n7. We do allow the learned Attorney General for\nPakistan to take instructions from the Government but in\nview of the importance of the issue involved in the\npetition, we direct that: -\n\nall the appointments, transfers and postings, which\nhave been made by the Caretaker Government,\nreferred to hereinabove, shall stand suspended and\ntill pendency of this petition no further appointment,\ntransfer and posting shall be made by the Caretaker\nGovernment including the appointment of Federal\nOmbudsman, Tax Ombudsman and Anti-Dumping\nTribunal, except the postings and transfers, which\nrelate to day-to-day business of the government and\nare required to be made in the interest of State and\nalso to watch the interest of public, strictly following\nthe rules and regulations on the subject, and in a\ntransparent manner.”\n\nOrder dated 04.06.2013\n\n“2. Khawaja Muhammad Asif, petitioner, appeared in\nperson and stated that the order dated 22.05.2013 has not\nbeen complied with in letter and spirit inasmuch as the\nCaretaker Government without lawful authority terminated\nthe services of some of those officers who were already\nworking and performing their duties in Finance Division\nand I.T., either as Advisors or on contract. As duly elected\ngovernment is likely to take over within a day or so and\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc. 7\n\nbudget is likely to be prepared shortly, therefore, due to\nunlawful action of Caretaker Government concerned\nDivisions are facing a lot of difficulties. He has further\nstated that about more than 100 officers have been sent\non deputation to different organizations from the Province\nof Balochistan after 22.4 May, 2013 without adhering to the\nrules and regulations knowing well that the orders relating\nto the policy making cannot be passed by the Caretaker\nGovernment.\n\n4. Since all these issues are important in nature,\ntherefore, we direct the Secretaries, Establishment,\nCabinet, Health, Water & Power, Finance Division(s) and all\nother concerned Departments/Corporations to file lists of\nthe officers —\n\n(a) who were appointed against any post by the Caretaker\nGovernment after taking over including Chairmen etc of\nthe Corporations whose list finds mention in the order\ndated 22.05.2013;\n\n(b) whose services were acquired on deputation from\ndifferent organizations on different positions in the\nDepartments and Corporations controlled by the Federal\nGovernment;\n\n(c) whose services were terminated because they were\nholding different positions on contract basis in all the\nGovernment Departments/Hospitals;\n\n(d) Whose transfers have been made contrary to the\nJudgment of Anita Turab’s case, etc;\n\n(e) Deputationists brought to Federal Government\nDepartments from the Province of Balochistan.”\n\nIn response to the above orders, summary of the transfers, postings,\n\ntermination of service/contract of the employees was submitted vide\n\nCMA No.3515/2013, which reads as under: -\n\nSTATEMENT INDICATING POSTINGS/TRANSFERS/APPOINTMENTS MADE BY\n\nTHE CARETAKER GOVERNMENT\n\nSl. | Group/ Promotion Directive | Ministries/| Repatriated| Addl.

It may be mentioned here that in the order dated\n\n22.05.2013 it had been observed that any individual whose posting,\nappointment or transfer was suspended and he was aggrieved of the\nsaid order, he might come forward by making application(s), which\nwould be dealt with after hearing him/them.\n\n5. It may be observed that learned Attorney General\ninformed that Justice (R) Faqir Muhammad Khokar, Chairman Anti-\nDumping Appellate Tribunal, Justice (R) Ahmed Khan _Lashari,\nChairman NEPRA and Justice (R) Kalash Nath Kohli, Chairman Sacked\nEmployees’ Review Board have tendered resignations, which are under\nprocess, except the resignation of Chairman Anti-Dumping Tribunal,\nwhich has already been accepted on 31.05.2013. Mr. Sher Afzal, Joint\nSecretary is directed that no sooner their resignations are accepted, he\nmay inform the Court.\n\n6. Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that under\nthe Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the elected\nParliamentary Government is responsible to achieve the object of good\ngovernance and in continuance of the same, it is obliged to post\nsuitable persons being in the employment of the Government/private\nsector to head various departments, corporations and organizations\ncontrolled by the Government to run their  result-oriented\nadministration, as such elected Government has to fulfill the object\nand purpose of welfare of the citizens. The Caretaker Government,\n\nwhich is installed for a limited period of 2/3 months with the object of\n\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc. 9\n\nassisting the Election Commission of Pakistan in organizing fair, free,\nhonest and just elections, cannot be considered to be the replacement\nof the elected Government. As such, the Caretaker Government is\ndebarred from making large scale transfers, postings, re-shuffling of\nthe Government employees, having far reaching effects/impact on the\nadministration, commercial and industrial departments/organizations,\nbecause if a person is appointed against an important position, and his\nperformance is not found suitable or it is not in accordance with the\npolicies of the elected Government, it would not be possible for the\nGovernment to implement its policies. He further argued that the\nCaretaker Government had also exceeded its authority in assigning the\nreasons that the appointments, postings, transfers, reshuffling, etc.,\nhave been made following the directions/observations contained in the\nletter dated 02.04.2013 of the Election Commission of Pakistan.\n\n7. Learned Attorney General for Pakistan did not address\narguments on the issues involved in these cases as such and only\nconfined to making certain references to the record, e.g., CMA 2676 &\n2770/2013 in Constitution Petition No.23/2012 filed pursuant to the\nCourt's directions as well as CMA No.3514/2013, etc., filed in the case.\n8. In pursuance of this Court’s order dated 22.05.2013,\nvarious individuals filed applications seeking relief against their\npostings, transfers, etc. and such of the applicants, who were present\nin Court, were also afforded opportunity of hearing. Some of them did\nnot press their applications and requests so made by them were\nallowed.

It is to be observed that the other learned Bench of this\n\nCourt, while hearing Constitution Petitions No.23/2013 on 09.05.2013\n\nwas, prima facie, of the opinion that notification of the Election\n\nCommission dated 02.04.2013 did not provide any valid justification,\n\nmuch less a compelling reason, so as to justify the transfers, postings,\n\netc., in question. The contents of notification of the ECP are\nreproduced hereinbelow: -\n\n“ELECTION COMMISSION OF PAKISTAN\nNOTIFICATION\nIslamabad the 2™ April, 2013\nNo.F.8(12)/2012-Cord(1)- WHEREAS it is expedient to\n\nensure that all those who are in the service of Pakistan\nperform their duties to serve public interest and assist the\n\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc. 14\n\nElection Commission of Pakistan in the conduct of General\nElections 2013 fairly, justly, honestly and in accordance\nwith law;\n\nAND WHEREAS it is also expedient to take pre-emptive\nsteps so that no employee in the service of Pakistan should\ntry to influence the election process in any manner to\nfavour any particular political party or a candidate;\n\nNOW THEREFORE, in exercise of the powers conferred\nupon it under Article 218(3) of the Constitution read with\nsections 103(c) and 104 of the Representation of the\nPeople Act 1976, the directions dated 08.06.2012 of the\nSupreme Court of Pakistan in Workers’ Party Pakistan’s\ncase and all other powers enabling it in that behalf, the\nElection Commission of Pakistan is pleased to direct the\nFederal and Provincial Caretaker Governments to:\n\n(i) | Shuffle/transfer all Federal and Provincial\nSecretaries. However, if the caretaker government\nconsiders that a federal or provincial secretary need\nnot be transferred/shuffled, it may refrain from doing\nso and intimate the same to the Election\nCommission.\n\n(ii) (ji) Assess whether the Chairpersons / Chief\nExecutives of all autonomous and semi-autonomous\nand/or state owned bodies, IG Police, CCPOs, City\nCommissioners, DCOs, DPOs, SHOs, patwaris and\nEDOs are independent individuals and transfer those\nwho do not meet this criteria.\n\n2. Clauses (iii) and (iv) of this Commission’s Notification\nNo.8(12)/2012-Cord(1) dated 26th March, 2013 are\nhereby withdrawn. This directive shall not apply to specific\ntransfers made under the directions of the Election\nCommission.\nBy Order of the Election Commission of Pakistan.\nSd/-\n\n(Syed Sher Afgan)\nActing Secretary”\n\n10. A perusal of the above notification suggests that it was\nissued by the ECP under Article 218(3) of the Constitution read with\nsections 103(c) and 104 of the Representation of the People Act, 1976\n\nand the directions dated 08.06.2012 of this Court issued in Worker’s\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc. 15\n\nParty Pakistan v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD 2012 SC 681) and all\n\nother powers enabling it in that behalf, directing the Federal and\nProvincial Caretaker Governments to transfer/shuffle all Federal and\nProvincial Secretaries. However, if the Caretaker Government\nconsidered that a Federal or Provincial Secretary need not be\ntransferred/shuffled, it would refrain from doing so and intimate the\nsame to the ECP. We tend to agree with the learned counsel for the\npetitioner that under the notification noted hereinabove; the Caretaker\nGovernment had been authorized not to transfer/shuffle any\nGovernment servant, if it considered that it was not expedient to do\nso. But, at any rate, no powers were given to requisition the services\nof the employees on deputation or make fresh appointments against\nthe available vacancies, or make proforma promotions of officials of all\ngrades in autonomous and semi-autonomous bodies, corporations,\nregulatory authorities, statutory bodies, government controlled\ncorporations, etc.\n11. It is to be seen that the Caretaker Cabinet/Prime Minister\nwere installed in the Federation and Provinces in the month of March,\n2013 after dissolution of the National and the Provincial Assemblies on\ncompletion of their respective terms provided under Article 224(1) &\n(1A) of the Constitution, which read as under: -\n224. Time of election and bye-election.— (1) A general\nelection to the National Assembly or a Provincial Assembly\nshall be held within a period of sixty days immediately\nfollowing the day on which the term of the Assembly is due\nto expire, unless the Assembly has been sooner dissolved,\nand the results of the election shall be declared not later\nthan fourteen days before that day.\n(1A) On dissolution of the Assembly on completion of its\nterm, or in case it is dissolved under Article 58 or Article\n\n112, the President, or the Governor, as the case may be,\nshall appoint a caretaker Cabinet:\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc. 16\n\nProvided that the care-taker Prime Minister shall be\nappointed by the President in consultation with the Prime\nMinister and the Leader of the Opposition in the outgoing\nNational Assembly, and a care-taker Chief Minister shall be\nappointed by the Governor in consultation with the Chief\nMinister and the Leader of the Opposition in the outgoing\nProvincial Assembly:\nProvided further that if the Prime Minister or a Chief\nMinister and their respective Leader of the Opposition do\nnot agree on any person to be appointed as a care-taker\nPrime Minister or the care-taker Chief Minister, as the case\nmay be, the provisions of Article 224A shall be followed :\nProvided also that the Members of the Federal and\nProvincial care-taker Cabinets shall be appointed on the\nadvice of the care-taker Prime Minister or the care-taker\nChief Minister, as the case may be.\n12. As in instant case the Caretaker Prime Minister could not\nbe appointed in terms of Article 224(1A) of the Constitution for want of\nconsensus between the former elected Prime Minister and the Leader\nof the House, therefore, the provisions of Article 224A of the\nConstitution were invoked, and ultimately on account of inability of the\nCommittee constituted under Article 224A(1) & (2) to decide the\nmatter, the names of the nominees were referred to the Election\nCommission of Pakistan for finalizing the name of the caretaker Prime\nMinister within two days, thus, as a result of deliberations by the ECP,\nCaretaker Prime Minister was appointed in accordance with the\nprovisions of Articles 224(1A) and 224A(1) & (2) of the Constitution.\n13. Essentially, according to the settled and accepted\nnorms/practice, the Caretaker Government (Prime Minister and\nCabinet) is required to perform its functions to attend to the day-to-\nday matters, which are necessary to run the affairs of the State and\n\nalso to watch the national interests, etc., in any eventuality in absence\n\nof an elected Government, and such Government is not authorized to\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc. 17\n\nmake decisions/appointments having effect on the working/policies of\nthe future Government, which is likely to take over after the elections.\nApart from providing assistance to the Election Commission in\norganizing free, fair, honest and just elections in the country, it is not\nvested with the authority to take decisions concerning the affairs of\nthe Government, which are bound to pre-empt the scope and sphere\nof activity, powers and jurisdiction of an elected Government. A\nCaretaker Government possesses limited powers and _ authority\nparticularly in view of the fact that when it is appointed, there is no\nNational Assembly in place and thus the all important aspect of\naccountability is absent. Further, the exercise of complete powers by\nthe Caretaker Government goes against the doctrine of separation of\npowers which is the lifeline of any vibrant democracy. As noted earlier,\nthe absence of legislature results in lack of checks and balances. The\nCaretaker Government also lacks the mandate of the majority of\npeople, which is to be acquired by elected government through the\ngeneral elections. Therefore, if a Caretaker Government is allowed to\nexercise complete powers available to an elected Government, it may\nmake an attempt to continue to remain in office for a longer period of\ntime or may take such decisions which may cause problems for the\nfuture elected government.\n\n14. As per the scheme of the Constitution, prior to the 18\"\nConstitutional Amendment, where the President dissolved the National\nAssembly under Article 48(5), he shall, in his discretion, appoint care-\ntaker Cabinet. Similarly, if the President, dissolves the National\nAssembly on the advice of the Prime Minister, he is required to put in\n\nplace an interim set up or a temporary arrangement to ensure the\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc. 18\n\ncontinuity of the functions of the Government to run day-to-day affairs\nof the State till the appointment of duly elected Government with its\nCabinet after completion of the election process. Unfortunately, after\nthe promulgation of the Constitution of 1973, during the Martial Law\nregime of General (R) Zia-ul-Haq in 1985, by means of the 8th\nConstitutional Amendment, an infamous provision, namely, Article\n58(2)(b) was inserted into the Constitution, which provided that the\nPresident may dissolve the National Assembly in his discretion where,\nin his opinion, a situation has arisen in which the Government of the\nFederation cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of\nthe Constitution and an appeal to the electorate is necessary. The said\nprovision was later deleted by means of Thirteenth Constitutional\nAmendment in 1997. During the next Martial Law regime of General\n(R) Pervez Musharraf, the same was again inserted through the 17%\nConstitutional Amendment passed in 2003. However, after the\nrestoration of democratic governance in the country, the new elected\nGovernment again deleted the said provision from the Constitution\nthrough the 18\" Constitutional Amendment passed in 2010. It is to be\nnoted that in exercise of the powers under the said provision, for more\nthan one time, the National Assembly was dissolved and the elected\nPrime Minister/Cabinet were removed, and caretaker Prime Minister\nand Cabinet were appointed.\n\n15. The object and purpose of making reference to these\nprovisions is to highlight that the functions of the elected Government\nhave remained under serious threats. At the same time, it is also\nsignificant to point out that despite appointment of the Caretaker\n\nPrime Minister/Cabinet, no guidelines were ever provided laying down\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc. 19\n\nthe parameters to be observed by the Caretaker Governments in the\nexercise of their powers. As far as Constitution is concerned, Article 2A\nenvisages that State shall exercise its powers and authority through\nthe chosen representatives of the people and a comprehensive\nprocedure, including qualifications and the disqualifications for the\npersons to be elected as Members of Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament) has\nbeen prescribed. Thus, it is the chosen representatives of the people\nwho have to run the affairs of the State for a fixed term of five years.\nSuch representatives of the people are required to ensure good\ngovernance, lay down policies, and ensure betterment of the general\npublic through legislative and executive actions. On the contrary, a\nCaretaker Government as compared to an elected Government\nremains in office for a very limited period whose first and last concern\nis to ensure that fair, free, honest and just elections are held in the\ncountry. The concept of caretaker or interim Government, in absence\nof an elected government is in vogue in a number of countries since\nthe ancient times. Inasmuch as, in the Constitution of some of the\ncountries, the concept of caretaker government does not specifically\nfind a place, yet the practice of appointing caretaker government is in\nvogue those countries. Such countries include India, Australia,\nCanada, Bangladesh, Holland, New Zealand, UK, etc. With the passage\nof time, all those countries have developed Constitutional conventions,\non the basis of which the caretaker governments are put in place to\nrun the affairs of the State during the interim period, i.e. till returning\nto power of the duly elected governments having full powers and such\ncaretaker governments do not, in general, take any major policy\n\ndecisions, including making appointments of civil servants, etc.,\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc. 20\n\nparticularly in the manner it has been done by the Caretaker\nGovernment that had come into existence on completion of the term of\nthe previous Government.\n\n16. At this stage, reference may be made to the Constitutional\nsystem of Australia. As per the scheme of the Australian Constitution,\nthe caretaker government is expected to conduct itself in accordance\nwith a series of conventions administered by the department of the\nPrime Minister and Cabinet, although there is no law compelling the\ncaretaker government to do so. Usually, there is no separate\nappointment of a caretaker government and the outgoing government\ncontinues to function as caretaker government. During the 1975\nAustralian constitutional crisis, the then Governor-General appointed a\nnew government with the assurance that it would immediately advise\na general election, and it would operate on a caretaker basis in the\nmeantime. The political system of Australia ensures that a Cabinet is\nalways maintained and that caretaker governments abide by the\nconventions. Any flouting of the conventions by a caretaker\ngovernment would immediately come to light, and could go against\nthem in the election campaign. In this regard, a document titled\n“Guidance on Caretaker Conventions” has been administered by the\nDepartment of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Section 1.2 of the\nCaretaker Conventions provides that a caretaker government operates\nuntil the election result clearly indicates that either the incumbent\nparty has retained power, or in the case where there is to be a change\nof government, until the new government is appointed by the\nGovernor-General. The relevant clauses of the guidelines are\n\nreproduced hereinbelow: -\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc. 21\n\n“3. SIGNIFICANT APPOINTMENTS\n\n3.1 Governments defer making significant appointments\nduring the caretaker period. When considering the advice it\nwould give on whether an appointment qualifies as\n‘significant’, the agency should consider not only the\nimportance of the position, but also whether the proposed\nappointment would be likely to be controversial.\n\n3.2 If deferring the appointment is impracticable, usually\nfor reasons associated with the proper functioning of an\nagency, there are several options:\n\n° the Minister could make an acting appointment\nwhere permissible;\n\n° the Minister could make a short term appointment\nuntil shortly after the end of the caretaker period; or\n\n° if those options are not practicable, the Minister\ncould consult the relevant Opposition spokesperson\nregarding a full term appointment.”\n\nIn Canada too, “Guidelines on the Conduct of Ministers, Secretaries of\nState, Exempt Staff and Public Servants during an Election” have been\nissued which provide, inter alia, as under: -\n\nGUIDELINES ON THE CONDUCT OF MINISTERS, SECRETARIES\n\nOF STATE, EXEMPT STAFF AND PUBLIC SERVANTS\nDURING AND ELECTION\n\nThis does not mean that government is absolutely\nbarred from making decisions of announcements, or\notherwise taking action, during an election. It can and\nshould do so where the matter is routine and necessary for\nthe conduct of government business, or where it is urgent\nand in the public interest - for example, responding to a\nnatural disaster. In certain cases where a major decision is\nunavoidable during a campaign (e.g., due to an\ninternational obligation or an emergency), consultation\nwith the Opposition may be appropriate, particularly where\na major decision could be controversial or difficult for a\nnew government to reverse.\n\nContracts, G&Cs and Appointment\n\nAppointments should normally be deferred. The\nPrime Minister’s Office must be consulted before making\nany commitments concerning appointments that cannot be\ndeferred.\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc. 22\n\nAs far as UK is concerned, they have also issued similar guidelines in\n\n2010. Relevant guidelines are reproduced hereinbelow: -\n\nSECTION G\nGovernment Decisions\n\n1. During an election campaign the Government retains\nits responsibility to govern and Ministers remain in charge\nof their Departments. Essential business must be carried\non. In particular Cabinet Committees can continue to meet\nand consider correspondence if necessary, although in\npractice this may not be practical. If something requires\nurgent collective consideration, the Cabinet Secretariat\nshould be consulted.\n\n2. However, it is customary for Ministers to observe\ndiscretion in initiating any new action of a continuing or\nlong-term character. Decisions on matters of policy, and\nother issues such as large and/or contentious procurement\ncontracts, on which a new Government might be expected\nto want the opportunity to take a different view from the\npresent Government should be postponed until after the\nElection, provided that such postponement would not be\ndetrimental to the national interest or wasteful of public\nmoney.\n\nSECTION H\n\nPublic and Senior Civil Service Appointments\n\n1. All appointments requiring approval by the Prime\nMinister, other Civil Service and public appointments likely\nto prove sensitive, (including those where Ministers have\ndelegated decisions to officials or other authorities, such as\nappointments to certain NHS boards), should effectively be\nfrozen until after the Election. This applies to appointments\nwhere a candidate has already accepted a written offer.\nThe individual concerned should be told that the\nappointment will be subject to confirmation by the new\nAdministration after the Election.\n\n2. It is recognised that, should this procedure result in\nthe cancellation (or substantial delay) of an appointment\nby the new Administration, the relevant Department could\nbe vulnerable to legal action by a disappointed candidate\nwho had already accepted a written offer. To reduce the\nrisk of this happening, Departments might wish to:\n\n° recommend to their Secretary of State the\nadvisability either of delaying key stages in the\nprocess, or of consulting the Opposition (e.g. on a\nshort-list of candidates or a single name for final\nselection) where an appointment is likely to take\neffect just before or after an election;\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc.\n\n23\n\n° issue a conditional letter of offer, making it clear that\nthe formal offer of the appointment will need to be\nconfirmed by a new Administration.\n\n3. In cases where an appointment is due to end\nbetween the announcement of the Election and Election\nDay, and no announcement has been made concerning the\nnew appointment, it will normally be possible for the post\nto be left vacant until incoming Ministers have been able to\ntake a decision either about re-appointment of the existing\nappointee or the appointment of a new person. This\nsituation is also likely to apply to any appointments made\nby Letters Patent, or otherwise requiring Royal approval,\nsince it would not be appropriate to invite Her Majesty to\nmake a conditional appointment.\n\n4. In the case of public and Senior Civil Service\nappointments, Departments should delay the launch of any\nopen competition during an election period, to give any\nincoming Administration the option of deciding whether to\nfollow the existing approach.\n\n5. In those cases where an appointment is required to\nbe made, it is acceptable, in the case of sensitive Senior\nCivil Service positions, to allow temporary promotion or\nsubstitution. In the case of public appointments, the\ncurrent term may be extended to cover the Election\nperiod, or as required, with the prior approval of the\nCommissioner for Public Appointments. This will allow time\nfor new Ministers to take a decision about longer term\nappointment. In any cases of doubt, and particularly where\ncircumstances make it difficult to apply these temporary\narrangements, Departments should consult the Propriety\nand Ethics Team in the Cabinet Office.\n\nThe Cabinet Manual: A guide to laws, conventions and rules on the\n\noperation of government, 1% edition, October 2011 provides, inter alia,\n\nas under: -\n\nPARLIAMENT\n\n7. Parliament has a number of functions, which include:\ncontrolling national expenditure and taxation; making law;\nscrutinising executive action; being the source from which\nthe Government is drawn; and debating the issues of the\nday. All areas of the UK are represented in the House of\nCommons, which provides a forum for Members of\nParliament (MPs) to speak and correspond on behalf of\ntheir constituents, where they can seek redress _ if\nnecessary.\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc. 24\n\n17.\n\n8. Parliament comprises the Sovereign in Parliament\nand two Houses: the House of Commons, which is wholly\nelected, and the House of Lords, which comprises the\nLords Spiritual and Temporal. Parliament has overall\ncontrol of the public purse; the Government may not levy\ntaxes, raise loans or spend public money unless and until it\nhas authorisation from Parliament. The House of Commons\nclaims exclusive rights and privileges over the House of\nLords in relation to financial matters, and the powers of\nthe House of Lords to reject legislation passed by the\nHouse of Commons are limited by statute.\n\n9. In the exercise of its legislative powers, Parliament is\nsovereign. In practice, however, Parliament has chosen to\nbe constrained in various ways - through its Acts, and by\nelements of European and other international law.\n\n10. Parliament also scrutinises executive action. Indeed,\nthe government of the day is primarily responsible to\nParliament for its day-to-day actions. This function is\nexercised through a variety of mechanisms, such as the\nselect committee system, Parliamentary questions, oral\nand written statements, debates in both Houses and the\nParliamentary Commissioner for Administration. See\nChapter Five for more on Parliament.\n\n[Emphasis supplied]\n\n11. By the Scotland Act 1998, the Government of Wales\nActs 1998 and 2006 and the Northern Ireland Act 1998,\nParliament devolved powers over areas of domestic policy\nsuch as housing, health and education to directly elected\nlegislatures in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nParliament retains the legal power to continue to legislate\non these matters, but it does not normally do so without\nthe consent of these devolved legislatures. See Chapter\nEight for more on devolution.\n\nComing to the case in hand, it may be mentioned here that\n\nthis is not the first time that this Court is confronted with such a\n\nsituation. Earlier too, identical matters have been dealt with by the\n\nSuperior Courts of Pakistan. In the case of Khawaja Muhammad Sharif\n\nv. Federation of Pakistan (PLD 1988 Lahore 725) wherein the Lahore\n\nHigh Court held that caretaker Cabinets have to confine themselves to\n\ntake care of the day-to-day administration of the State. Relevant\n\nportion of the judgment reads as under: -\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc. 25\n\n“26. The learned Attorney-General submitted that it is\nquite correct that Caretaker Cabinets have to take care of\nthe day-to-day administration of the State. There may be\nno bar to take policy decisions if so required by the\ncircumstances. He is right. Caretaker Cabinets have to\nconfine themselves to take care of the day-to-day\nadministration of the State. They can take all decisions\nrequiring attention or action, may be having far-reaching\neffects, like in respect of war and peace or earthquake or\nfloods. But they can neither forget the predominant\nposition of their being Caretaker nor can they take undue\nadvantage of their position either for themselves or for\ntheir political parties. They have to be impartial to\neverybody, including their rivals or opponents in the\npolitical fields. They cannot take advantage of their official\nposition of Caretaker Government at the expense of other\npolitical forces or people at large. Neutrality, impartiality,\ndetachment and devotion to duty to carry on day-to-day\naffairs of the State without keeping in view one’s own\ninterest_or of one’s party are the sine qua non of a\nCaretaker Cabinet.”\n\n[Emphasis supplied]\n\nIn the case of Regional Commissioner of Income Tax v. Zaffar Hussain\n\n(PLD 1992 SC 869) Mr. Justice (R) Abdul Shakurul Salam J., in his\ndissenting note held as under: -\n\n“3. The following points are obvious and noteworthy.\nFirstly, that when the leader of the Opposition became\ncare-taker Prime Minister, displeasure or rancour of the\nOpposition was given vent to by ordering the removal of\nthe respondents from their service. It was rather petty.\nSecondly, as far as the authority of the Care-taker Cabinet\nis concerned, I had said in the case of \"Muhammad Sharif\nv. Federation of Pakistan\" (PLD 1988 Lahore 725) in the\nLahore High Court that \"Care-taker Cabinets have to\nconfine themselves to take care of the day to day\nadministration of the State. They can take all decisions\nrequiring attention or action, may be having far-reaching\neffects, like in respect of war and peace or earthquake or\nfloods. But they can neither forget the predominant\nposition of their being Care-taker nor can they take undue\nadvantage of their position either for themselves or for\ntheir political parties. They have to be impartial to\neverybody, including their rivals or opponents in the\npolitical fields. They cannot take advantage of their official\nposition of care-taker Government at the expense of other\npolitical forces or people at large. Neutrality, impartiality,\ndetachment and devotion to duty to carry on day to day\naffairs of the State without keeping in view one's own\ninterest or of one's own party are the sine qua non of a\nCare-taker Cabinet. The judgment was upheld by this\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc. 26\n\nCourt in \"Federation of Pakistan v. Haji Muhammad\nSaifullah Khan and others\" (PLD 1989 SC 166). The action\nof removal of the respondents clearly did not fall within the\nscope or ambit of the Care-taker Cabinet whose primary\nfunction was to hold election and carry on( day to day\nadministration with the civil servants available and not to\nthrow out those who had been given employment by the\npreviously elected Government.”\n\n[Emphasis supplied]\n\nIn the case of Tanveer A. Qureshi v. President of Pakistan (PLD 1997\n\nLahore 263) it has been held as under: -\n\n“26. Another principal attack on the formation of the\nC.D.N.S. by the petitioner was that the decision to set up\nsuch a council being of great importance and a matter of\npolicy could not have been taken by the Caretaker Cabinet\nappointed under Article 48(5) of the Constitution. It was\nemphasised by Mr. Talib H. Rizvi, as also Mr. Abdul\nRehman Cheema that the life of the Caretaker Cabinet\nbeing for 90 days it cannot take decisions of permanent\nnature but its activities are confined only to running day-\nto-day affairs of the Government and should be geared\ntowards holding of free and fair elections. Reliance has\nbeen placed on Kh. Muhammad Sharif v. Federation of\nPakistan and 18 others PLD 1988 Lah. 725, Federation of\nPakistan etc. v. Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao and others\nPLD 1992 SC 723 and Madan Murari Verma v. Ch. Charan\nSingh and another AIR 1980 Calcutta 95.\n\n28. Article 48(5) of the Constitution enjoins the President\nto appoint a caretaker Cabinet to run the affairs of the\ncountry pending the elections to the National Assembly\nand formation of Government. The use of word ‘Caretaker’\nis not without significance and has to be given some\nmeaning. The argument of the learned Attorney-General\nand Mr. Sharif-ud-Din Pirzada that ‘Caretaker’ signifies the\ntemporary nature of the tenure appears to be attractive\nand coming from a jurist like Mr. Sharif-ud-Din Pirzada is\nentitled to great respect but with due deference we are\nunable to agree with them. A Cabinet appointed by the\nPrime Minister to run the affairs of the country till the next\nGeneral Elections by its very nature is temporary and the\nlife of it is limited by the Constitution itself till the next\nGeneral Elections which are to be held within 90 days. It\nwas thus not necessary to use the word ‘Caretaker’ to\nindicate temporary nature of the tenure. On the other\nhand we are of the view that this word has been used in\nArticle 48(5) to emphasises the purpose of appointment\nend the nature of the power available to the Caretaker\nGovernment. ... ...\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc. 27\n\n30. wo. Although no hard and fast rules can be laid\ndown in respect of the, powers available to the Caretaker\nCabinet to take decisions as the answer would depend\nupon facts of each case but generally speaking a major\npolicy-decision which can await the formation of regularly\nelected Government without causing any disruption or\ndanger to the functioning of the State or orderly running of\nthe country should be left to be determined by the elected\nrepresentatives of the people, moreso when the Caretaker\nCabinet cannot claim to have been given any mandate by\nthe people. There may not be any express restriction on\nthe powers of the Caretaker Cabinet by the Constitution\nitself but the conclusion reached by us flows from the use\nof words “Caretaker Cabinet” in Article 48(5) of the\nConstitution as also very nature of the Caretaker Cabinet\nand the purpose for which it has been appointed.\n\nIn the case of Khawaja Ahmad Tariq Rahim _v. the Federation of\n\nPakistan (PLD 1992 SC 646), this Court held as under: -\n\n“Be ae The object of the Care-taker Cabinet is to fill a\ntemporary void, so that it may conduct day to day\nadministration, without getting involved in matters of\nsubstantive importance or policy or subjects having far-\nreaching effects, other than during an emergency or some\nurgency, till the new Government is installed. Above all, it\nis not supposed to influence the elections or do or cause to\nbe done anything whereby which Government machinery\nor funds are channelled in favour of any political party.”\n\nIn the case of Madan Murari Verma _v. Choudhuri Charan Singh (AIR\n1980 Cal 95), the Court held as under: -\n\n“The President has accepted the resignation of the\nrespondent No. 1 and his Council of Ministers and has\nasked them to continue in office “till other arrangements\nare made”. It is the limited pleasure indicated and in that\nfield only in my opinion the respondent No. 1 and his\nCouncil of Ministers can function. There is no mention of\nany care-taker Government as such, in our Constitution or\nin the constitutional law, though Sir Ivor Jennings has\ndescribed in his book -- Cabinet Government, Third Ed. p.\n85 the ministry that was formed by Mr. Churchill in\nEngland after the war before and pending the General\nelection in 1945 as care-taker Government. But an\nextraodinary situation like the present, in my opinion, calls\nfor a care-taker Government and therefore, the respondent\nNo. 1 and his Council of Ministers can only carry on day-to-\nday administration in office which are necessary for\ncarrying on “for making alternative arrangements”. In\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc. 28\n\neffect the President, in my opinion is therefore, not obliged\nto accept the advice that the respondent No. 1 and his\nCouncil of Ministers tender to him except for day-to-day\nadministration and the Council of Ministers and the\nrespondent No. 1 should not make any decisions which are\nnot necessary except for the purpose of carrying on the\nadministration until other arrangements are made. This in\neffect means that any decision or policy decision or any\nmatter which can await disposal by the Council of Ministers\nresponsible to the House of People must not be tendered\nby the respondent number 1 and his Council of Ministers.\nWith this limitation the respondent No. 1 and the Council\nof Ministers can only function. And in case whether such\nadvice is necessary to carry on the _ day-to-day\nadministration till “other arrangements are made” or\nbeyond that, the President, in my opinion, is free to judge.\nIt is true again that this gives the President powers which\nhave not been expressly conferred by the Constitution.\nBut, in my opinion, having regard to the basic principle\nbehind this Constitution under Article 75(3) read with\nArticle 74(1) in the peculiar facts and circumstances of this\ncase is the only legitimate, legal and workable conclusion\nthat can be made.\n\nIn the case of R. Krishnaiah v. State Of Andhra Pradesh (AIR 2005 AP\n\n10) it was held that: -\n\n“10. In support of his submissions learned Counsel placed\nreliance on the recommendations of the Sarkaria\nCommission referred to by a Constitution Bench of the\nSupreme Court in S.R. Bommai and Ors. etc., etc. v. Union\nof India and Ors. etc., etc., , more particularly,\nrecommendation No. 6-8-04(A) that after dissolution of\nthe Assembly and till new Government takes over, during\nthe interim period, the Caretaker Government should be\nallowed to function. But as a matter of convention,\nCaretaker Government should merely carry on day-to-day\nGovernment and desist from taking any major policy\ndecision. He thus urged that issuing Ordinance permitting\nto withdraw amount from the Consolidated Fund of the\nState of Andhra Pradesh to meet (a) the grants made in\nadvance in respect of the estimated expenditure for a part\nof the financial year commencing on the 1st April, 2004 as\nset forth in Column (3) of the Schedule appended to the\nOrdinance and (b) the expenditure charged on the\nConsolidated Fund of the State of Andhra Pradesh, for the\npart of the same financial year, as set forth in Column (4)\nof the Schedule, is nothing but a major policy decision\nwhich ought not to have been taken.\n\n16. Therefore, the submission that the Ordinance could not\nhave been promulgated is misconceived. Ordinance has\nthe same force and effect as any Act of the State\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc. 29\n\nLegislature and there is no prohibition in the Constitution\nthat during the period an Assembly is dissolved and fresh\nAssembly has not yet been constituted, that Ordinance\ncould not have been promulgated by the Governor. This\nact of the Governor will be deemed to be an exercise of\npower of the Legislative Assembly, as envisaged under\nArticle 206 and even under Article 205 and as noticed\nabove. Clause (3) of Article 203 is a prohibition not to\nwithdraw from the Consolidated Fund any amount being\nsubject to provisions of Articles 205 and 206 of the\nConstitution. The Ordinance having validly been\npromulgated there is hardly any force in the other\nsubmission that a situation has arisen where power must\nbe exercised or directed to be exercised by the President of\nIndia under Articles 356 or 360 of the Constitution.”\n\n18. The crux of the above case-law and conventions/guidelines\nis that the Caretaker Government/Cabinet has to confine itself to the\nrunning of the day-to-day administration of the State. Indeed, it may\ntake decisions required for ordinary orderly running of the state, but\ndecisions having far-reaching effects should only be taken in\nextraordinary circumstances, like in war, earthquake, floods, etc.\nAlthough there may not be any express restriction on the powers of\nthe caretaker government by the Constitution itself, but a major\npolicy-decision which can await the formation of regularly elected\nGovernment without causing any disruption or danger to the\nfunctioning of the State or orderly running of the country should be left\nto be determined by the elected government. Thus, there can be no\ntwo opinions that the caretaker government has to exercise the\npowers for a limited purpose as it has been highlighted hereinabove,\nnamely, relating to the elections and not to make fresh appointments\nof the civil servants or make appointments of the heads of the\nAutonomous, Semi-Autonomous Bodies, Corporations, Regulatory\nAuthorities, etc., appointments on contract basis or allowing\n\ndeputation or promotion to the civil servants without realizing the\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc. 30\n\nscope of their efficacy to share higher responsibilities to run the affairs\nof the Government.\n\n19. In the context of instant case, besides relying upon the\nguidelines in the judgments noted hereinabove, one may conveniently\npose a question, particularly in view of Article 48(5) of the Constitution\nand other constitutional provisions, as to why a_ caretaker\ncabinet/government appointed under Article 224 or as the case may\nunder Article 224A of the Constitution, should not exercise powers\navailable to a duly elected government? Answer to this question lies in\nthe expression “Interim Cabinet” used in Article 48(5) of the\nConstitution, which enables to draw the inference that the interim\nCabinet or caretaker Cabinet headed by a Prime Minister means a\ncaretaker cabinet or a government, which has been _ entrusted\ntemporary charge of government during the period when the National\nAssembly is dissolved because ordinarily for a period of five years\nunder Article 58, the National Assembly exists for the purpose of\nrunning the affairs of the State and in absence of elected Parliament,\ncontinuity of the governance system in the country has to be kept\nintact, otherwise running the affairs of the State would not be possible\nat all. In addition to it, although in our country in respect of the\npowers of the caretaker government no conventions have been\ndeveloped and for such reasons the instant Caretaker Government\nindulged in taking vital policy decisions and making postings and\nappointments of heads of statutory bodies, postings and appointments\nin civil service, statutory bodies, autonomous, semi-autonomous\nbodies, corporations and_ regulatory authorities, including\n\nappointments on contract or accepting the services of various persons\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc. 31\n\non deputation by allowing them to occupy one step higher positions\nthan the one, which they were holding previously.\n\n20. Petitioner Khawaja Muhammad Asif appeared and pointed\nout that caretaker government had made transfers/postings in civil\nservice, statutory bodies, autonomous, semi-autonomous bodies,\ncorporations and regulatory authorities, etc., the list of which has been\nmade part of the record.\n\n21. The learned Attorney General while appearing in\nConstitution Petitions No.14 of 2013, etc., made a statement, already\nmentioned in the order dated 22.05.2013, which is reproduced\nhereinbelow: -\n\n\"12. That the federation is already on record in taking up a\nprincipled stand before this Hon’ble Court that the care-\ntaker government needs only to confine their work to ‘day\nto day’ routine matters and effectively maintain the status\nquo for the incoming elected government, while submitting\nthe views of the federation vide a CMA filed in\nConstitutional Petition Nos.14, 16 to 18 of 2013. It is\nsubmitted that vide the said CMA the Attorney General\nsubmitted that the care-taker government should avoid\ntaking and controversial step and should not commit any\nprocess that is not reversible by the incoming elected\ngovernment and further that the care-taker government\nshould restrict itself to activity that is a) routine, b) non-\ncontroversial, c) urgent and in public interest, d) reversible\nby the elected government; and e) any significant\nappointment thereby avoiding any major decisions except\n\nagreed to by the opposition.\n\n13. That the learned Attorney General whilst representing\nthe case of the federation in the foresaid constitutional\n\npetitions also relied upon Australian Caretaker Conventions\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc. 32\n\nand highlighted that the key elements of the code of\n\nconduct should include:\n\na) avoiding major policy decisions,\n\nb) avoiding any significant appointments,\n\nc) signing any major contract,\n\nd) avoiding international treaty or commitment,\n\netc.\n\nIt was in the same light that the learned Attorney\nGeneral submitted before this Hon’ble Court that the care-\ntaker government had deferred some items of the Council\nof Common Interests (CCI) in a recently held meeting and\nwas not, therefore, making any binding\ndecisions/commitments with IMF, World Bank or any other\ndonor agency and had further decided not to enter into\nany binding agreement or treaty to bind the future elected\ngovernment. It is submitted, therefore, that the care-taker\ngovernment having earlier taken a principled stand cannot\n\nthereafter be allowed to recuse from the same.”\nSimilarly, the Law Minister of the Caretaker Government also objected\nto the appointments, which were being made directly or indirectly\nunder the verbal or written directions/observations of the caretaker\nPrime Minister or Cabinet Ministers or the heads of different\nDepartments, Divisions, Ministries, etc. Relevant extract from his\nstatement was published in Daily Dawan, Islamabad dated\n\n19.05.2013, which is reproduced hereinbelow: -\n\nu\n\ncaretaker Law Minister Ahmar Bilal Soofi has also\ncriticised the postings and transfers being made by the\ngovernment of Prime Minister retired Justice Mir Hazar\nKhan Khoso.\n\nHe warned the caretaker set-up against transgressing its\nmandate by making undue transfers and postings in\nimportant government departments.\n\nIn a letter to his cabinet colleagues a copy of which he also\nsent to the Prime Minister Secretariat and the\nestablishment secretary, Mr Soofi said: “Cabinet members\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc. 33\n\nshould abide by the legal limitation they enjoy under the\nconstitution. They should not trespass the mandate of the\ninterim government.\n\n“I would again reiterate that we may continue the\nprevalent transparency and may not take action\nwhich may be counter-productive to the important\nrole performed by the caretaker government.”\n\nTalking to Dawn on Sunday, the law minister confirmed\nthat he had highlighted in the letter the issue of\nunnecessary postings and transfers being carried out by\nsome of his colleagues in the cabinet. But he did not\nmention any specific posting or transfer. He said the letter\nhad been dispatched on Saturday.\n\nIn his letter Mr Soofi has also mentioned the cancellation\nof contract of two officials of the information ministry and\nthe recent replacement of the National Highway Authority’s\nchairman. The letter also referred to a statement he had\nearlier made in cabinet that it was advisable to avoid\nmaking controversial appointments in major departments\nand leave them to the elected government.”\n\n22. We consider it appropriate to make reference of the case\n\ntitled as In re: Abdul Jabbar Memon (1996 SCMR 1349) wherein it has\n\nbeen observed that the Federal Government, Provincial Governments,\nStatutory Bodies and the Public Authorities have been making initial\nrecruitments, both ad-hoc and regular, to posts and offices without\npublicly and properly advertising the vacancies and at times by\nconverting ad-hoc appointments into regular appointments. It was\nheld that this practice is prima facie violative of Fundamental Right\nenshrined in Article 18 of the Constitution guaranteeing to every\ncitizen freedom of profession, which must be discontinued forthwith\nand immediate steps should be taken to rectify the situation, so as to\nbring the practice in accord with the Constitutional requirement. But\nunfortunately it has been noticed that the guidelines/principles have\nneither been followed by the duly elected governments in the past nor\n\nby the caretaker governments. Inasmuch as, principle of transparency\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc. 34\n\nhas not been adhered to in the appointments of the Members of the\nFederal Public Service Commission under the Ordinance of 1977 to\nconduct tests/examinations for recruitment of persons to all Pakistan\nServices, Civil Services of the Federation and civil posts in connection\nwith the affairs of the Federation and Provinces. No transparent\nsystem is in place to ensure merit-based selection of persons for\nappointment as the heads of the autonomous, semi-autonomous\nbodies, corporations, organizations, etc. Record available in archives\nwould indicate that except for a shorter period, despite presence and\navailability of renowned knowledgeable and reputable personalities,\nthese vacancies were allowed to be occupied by persons having\nconnections with the higher functionaries of the State, who openly\nindulged in favourtism and nepotism. In such a scenario, how the\nobject of making appointments on merit could be achieved, including\nby the elected government.\n\n23. It is to be noted that reportedly there are more than 100\norganizations/corporations, which are causing colossal loss of trillion of\nrupees to the public exchequer, like Pakistan International Airline,\nPakistan Railways, Pakistan Steel Mills, PEPCO, PASCO, Utility Stores\nCorporations, OGDCL, NEPRA, PEMRA, PTA, KESC, SSGPL, NICL, etc. It\nis a fundamental right of the citizens of Pakistan under Article 9 of the\nConstitution that the national wealth/resources must remain fully\nprotected whether they are under the control of the banks or the\nautonomous and semi-autonomous bodies.\n\n24. There are cases where favorites were appointed\n\ndespite lacking merits to hold such posts/positions. Reference\n\nmay be made to the case of Adnan A. Khawaja v. The State\n\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc. 35\n\n(2012 SCMR 1434) where a convict, who was acquitted of\ncriminal charges taking benefit of NRO, was appointed as the\n\nhead of OGDCL. Similarly, in the case of Mir Muhammad Idris v.\n\nFederation of Pakistan (PLD 2011 SC 213), the validity of the\n\nreappointment of Syed Ali Raza as President of the National Bank of\nPakistan for fifth time for one year was challenged. The Court declared\nthe said reappointment to be unconstitutional. Relevant para\ntherefrom is reproduced hereinbelow: -\n\n“11. ... Since, admittedly, the amendment made in section\n11(3)(d) of the Act of 1974 by the Finance Act, 2007 was\nunconstitutional and illegal, the appointment of respondent\nNo.3 made under an unconstitutional and illegal legislation\nwould not remain unaffected as the foundation on which its\nsuperstructure rested stood removed. The argument of the\nlearned counsel for respondent No. 3 that the appointment\nof respondent No.3 was made by the Federal Government\nin exercise of the power conferred upon it by a legislative\ninstrument passed by the concerned legislature, therefore,\nthe same was not liable to be interfered with being a past\nand closed transaction is not tenable. If the appointments\nof Judges were affected on account of a similar defect in\nlegislation, how the appointment of respondent No.3, who,\ntoo, was appointed under such an unconstitutional and.\nillegal amendment could be protected.\n\n13. .. The reappointment of respondent No.3 Syed Ali\nRaza as President NBP by way of notification dated\n10.4.2010 is declared to be unconstitutional and he shall\ncease to hold office as President NBP with immediate\neffect.”\n\nIn the same context, reference may also be made to the case of\nChairman of NICL Ayaz Khan Niazi, who again was appointed\nwithout determining whether he is fit and proper person to hold\nthe said post as a result whereof the government exchequer had\nto suffer an enormous loss, some of its portions have been\nrecovered and still cases are pending before the Courts. This\n\nCourt in Suo Moto Case No. 18 OF 2010 (PLD 2011 SC 927)\n\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc. 36\n\ndirected the Secretary Commerce to lodge complaint before FIA\nagainst the concerned persons for causing loss to the public\nexchequer. Similarly, the appointment of one Mr. Tauqir Sadiq as\nChairman of the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority was challenged\nbefore this Court on the ground that he did not posses the\nnecessary credentials for holding the said office. The Court in the\n\ncase reported as Muhammad Yasin v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD\n\n2012 SC 132), after considering the importance of the OGRA and\nscrutinizing the appointment process of its Chairman, declared\nhis appointment void ab initio. There are other cases where some\nof the persons had succeeded in getting contract employments\nafter their retirement in violation of section 14 of the Civil\nServants Act, 1973 as well as instructions contained in ESTA\n\nCode. Reference may be made to Suo Motu Case No. 24 of 2010\n\n(PLD 2011 SC 277) wherein it was observed that in the disciplined\nforces, particularly, like police and FIA where people have to work in a\nwell defined discipline, the persons supervising the forces were\npermitted to hold charge of the posts on contract basis. It may not be\nout of context to note that in terms of the definition of section\n2(1)(6)(ii) of the Civil Servants Act, 1973, a person who is employed\non contract does not fall within the definition of a civil servant, so his\nauthority to command and maintain discipline can be well imagined\nfrom the fact that if a person himself is not a civil servant, he is\nconsidered only bound by the terms and conditions of his contract and\nnot by the statutory law, because if any condition laid down in the\n\ncontract is violative of any statutory provision, he would only be\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc. 37\n\nsubject to action under the said contract. In this view of the matter,\nthe officers who were reemployed after retirement, were directed to be\n\nremoved. In a recent case titled as Muhammad Ashraf Tiwana v.\n\nPakistan (Constitution Petition No.59 of 2011), this Court found\nthat the appointments of Chairman and Members of the\nSecurities & Exchange Commission of Pakistan did not meet the\nrequirement of the Securities & Exchange Commission of\nPakistan Act, 1997 as such, the same too, were set aside. Last\nbut not the least, this Court while hearing the case regarding\nimplementation of directions issued in Suo Motu case No.16/2011\nregarding law and order situation in Karachi, directed the Government\nof Sindh to terminate the services of 86 employees appointed in\ndifferent grades from 12 to 21 on contract basis in various provincial\ndepartments.\n\n25. During hearing of the case, it has been pointed out to\npetitioner Khawaja Muhammad Asif that although he being an elected\nMember of the Parliament had raised questions touching upon the\ntransparency in the appointment of the heads of the autonomous,\nsemi-autonomous bodies, corporations, regulatory authorities, etc.,\nbut in his own capacity as a public representative, he had also to\nensure that all the appointments in such like bodies as well as the\nappointments on contract basis must be made in a transparent\nmanner. In some of the countries, effective steps have been taken to\nstop such colossal loss of the national resources by day-to-day\nmeasures to improve the professional quality and political neutrality of\nappointments to public bodies/regulatory authorities by ensuring that\n\nselection in such bodies is based on merit, fairness and openness. It\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc. 38\n\nmay not be out context to note that in UK, an independent\nCommissioner is available to regulate, monitor, report and advice the\npublic appointments, the performances etc. All the government\ndepartments while making such appointments are bound to follow the\ncode of practice which has been issued by such Commissioner.\nSimilarly, in Canada all appointments for Chief Executives, Directors\nand Chairpersons of public sector corporations are subject to strict\nmerit-based system. It may be noted that elected government has to\nheavily rely upon public bodies to implement their policies and the\nobject essentially cannot be achieved if honest and competent persons\nare not holding such public offices. While making such appointments,\nfollowing parameters are to be considered: -\n(1) Integrity:\nHolders of public office should not place themselves under\nany financial or other obligation to outside individuals or\n\norganizations that might seek to influence them in the\nperformance of their official duties.\n\n(2) Objectivity:\n\nIn carrying out public business, including making public\nappointments, awarding contracts, or recommending\nindividuals for rewards and benefits, holders of public\noffice should make choice solely on merit.\n\n(3) Accountability:\n\nHolders of public office are accountable for their decisions\nand actions to the public and must submit themselves to\nwhatever scrutiny is appropriate to their office.\n\n(4) Openness:\n\nHolders of public office should be as open as possible\nabout all the decisions and actions that they take. They\nshould give reasons for their decisions and_ restrict\ninformation only when the wider public interest clearly\ndemands.\n\n(5) Honesty:\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc. 39\n\nHolders of public office have a duty to declare any private\ninterests relating to their public duties and to take steps to\nresolve any conflicts arising in a way that protects the\npublic interest.\n\n(6) Leadership:\n\nHolders of public office should promote and support these\n\nprinciples by leadership and example.\n26. Be that as it may, in order to ensure the enforcement of\nthe fundamental right enshrined in Article 9 of the Constitution and\nconsidering it to be a question of public importance, a Commission\nheaded by and comprising two other competent and independent\nmembers having impeccable integrity, may be _ the _ Federal\nOmbudsman or Chairman NAB or a Member of Civil Society having\nexceptional ability and integrity, is required to be constituted by the\nFederal Government through open merit based process having fixed\ntenure of four years to ensure appointments in statutory bodies,\nautonomous bodies, semi-autonomous bodies, regulatory authorities\nto ensure appointment of all the government controlled corporations,\nautonomous and semi-autonomous bodies, etc. The Commission\nshould be mandated to ensure that all public appointments are made\nsolely on merits. The Commission should discharge mainly the\nfollowing functions: -\n\n(i) Regulate public appointments processes within his remit;\n\n(ii) implement a Code of Practice that sets out the principles\nand core processes for fair and transparent merit-based\nselections;\n\n(iii) chair the selection panels for appointing heads of\npublic/statutory bodies and chairs and members of their\nboards, where necessary;\n\n(iv) appoint Public Appointments Assessors to chair the\nselection panels for appointing heads of public/statutory\n\nbodies and chairs and members of their boards, where\nappropriate;\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc. 40\n\n(v) report publicly on a public/statutory body’s compliance\nwith the Code of Practice, including examples of poor and\ngood performance, and best practice;\n\n(vi) investigate complaints about unfair appointment process;\n\n(vii) Monitor compliance with the Code of Practice;\n\n(viii) Ensure regular audit of appointments processes within his\nremit;\n\n(ix) Issue an annual report giving detailed information about\nappointments processes, complaints handled, and\nhighlights of the main issues which have arisen during the\nprevious year. The annual report for the previous calendar\nyear should be laid before the Parliament by 31° March; \\\n\n(x) Take any other measures deemed necessary for ensuring\nthat processes for public sector appointments that fall in\nhis remit are conducted honestly, justly, fairly and in\naccordance with law, and that corrupt practices are fully\nguarded against.\n\n27. The Code of Practice should provide foundations for\ntransparent merit-based public appointments. All public appointments\nmust be governed by the overriding principle of selection based on\nmerit, out of individuals who through abilities, experience and qualities\nhave a proven record that they best match the need of the public body\nin question. No public appointment must take place without first being\nrecommended by the Commission. The appointments procedures\nshould be subjected to the principle of proportionality, that is, what is\nappropriate for the nature of the post and the size and weight of its\nresponsibilities. Those, selected must be committed to the principles\nand values of public service and perform their duties with highest level\nof integrity. The information provided about the potential appointees\nmust be made public. The Commission may from time to time conduct\nan inquiry into the policies and procedures followed by an appointing\nauthority in relation to any appointment. He may also issue a\nstatement or publish a report commenting publicly on any breach or\n\nanticipated breach of the Code. The appointment of the successful\n\ncandidate must be publicized.\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc. 41\n\n28. In light of discussion made hereinabove, we hold that: -\n\n(a) The Caretaker Cabinet/Prime Minister appointed under Article\n224(1)(2) or 224A, as the case may be, is empowered to carry out\nonly day-to-day affairs of the State with the help of the available\nmachinery/resources/ manpower and also to watch national interest\nagainst war or national calamity or disaster faced by the nation,\n\nincluding terrorism, etc.\n\n(b) The civil servants who have already been appointed in\naccordance with the rules/regulations on the subject ought not to be\nposted/transferred, etc., except in extraordinary circumstances, that\ntoo, temporarily.\n\n(c) Major policy decisions including making of appointments,\ntransfers and postings of the Government servants should be left to be\nmade by the incoming government in view of the provisions of\nConstitution that the affairs of the State are to be run by the chosen\nrepresentatives of the people.\n\n(d) As newly elected Government is mandated to perform its\nfunctions of achieving the object and purpose of welfare of the people\nfor which it has been duly appointed, therefore, caretaker\nCabinet/government/Prime Minister, having no mandate of public\nsupport, is only caretaker set up and due to this connotation should\ndetach itself from making permanent policies having impact on future\n\nof the country.\n\n29. As we have noted hereinabove that since the Caretaker\nGovernment after its appointment, had made more than 400\nappointments, transfers and postings of Government\nservants/employees, including transfer on deputation with promotion\nto next higher grade or as the case may be, heads of autonomous,\nsemi-autonomous bodies, regulatory authorities, heads of government\ncontrolled institution, etc., therefore, it may not be possible for this\n\nCourt to discuss and deal with each and every case in these\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc.\n\n42\n\nproceedings, therefore, their cases shall be subject to declaration,\n\nwhich is being made hereinbelow.\n\n30. Thus, at the touchstone of the parameters laid down in the\n\nparas supra about the powers of the Caretaker Cabinet/Government, it\n\nis declared and held as under: -\n\n(a)\n\nThe orders of appointment/deputation, transfers as\nwell as postings, etc., of civil servants and Chief\nExecutive Officers of statutory bodies, autonomous/\nsemi-autonomous bodies, corporations, regulatory\nauthorities, etc., made by the Caretaker\nCabinet/Prime Minister are hereby declared to be\nvoid, illegal and of no legal effect w.e.f. date of\nissuance of notifications respectively, except the\ntransfers and appointments of senior government\nofficers including the Chief Secretaries and IGP of\n\nany of the Provinces during the election process.\n\n(i) However, the Federal Government, in exercise\nof its powers would be authorized to allow to\ncontinue any of such appointments, transfers\nmade by the Caretaker Cabinet/Government in\nthe public interest, subject to following\n\nrequisite provision of law.\n\n(ii) As far as the issue of notifications in the cases\nof (i) Mumtaz Khan (CMA 3451/2013), (ii)\nMuhammad Nadeem, AGM Marketing (CMA\n3480/2013) and (iii) General Syed Wajid\nHussain, Chairman HIT Taxila are concerned,\ntheir notification of appointment shall remain\nfrozen as process of their appointments had\ntaken place before assumption of charge by\nCaretaker Cabinet/Government but their\nnotifications were issued by the Caretaker\n\nGovernment. However, the Federal\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc.\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n43\n\nGovernment through competent authority shall\ndecide fate of their cases within 15 days after\nreceipt hereof and copy of decision shall be\n\nsent to Registrar for our perusal in Chambers.\n\n(iii) Needless to say that if there are identical cases\nas noted in para (a)(ii), same shall be dealt\n\nwith in the same manner.\n\nAll the orders of removal or transfers as well as\nposting on deputation of civil servants and Chief\nExecutive Officers of statutory bodies, autonomous/\nsemi-autonomous bodies, corporations, regulatory\nauthorities, etc., by the Caretaker Cabinet/Prime\nMinister are hereby declared void, illegal and of no\nlegal effect w.e.f. date of issuance of notifications\n\nrespectively, however:\n\n(i) | the Federal Government would be empowered\nto continue the removal or transfers, etc., of\nChief Executive Officers/heads oof the\ndepartments, statutory bodies, autonomous/\nsemi-autonomous bodies, corporations,\nregulatory authorities, etc. in the public\ninterest, subject to following requisite provision\n\nof law.\n\nAs far as contract employees are concerned, whose\ncontracts have been cancelled or those to whom\nfresh contracts of service have been given by the\ncaretaker Cabinet/Government, shall stand cancelled\nas holders of contract employment of both these\ncategories deserve no interference in view of the\njudgment of this Court in the case of State Life\nInsurance Employees Federation of Pakistan v.\nFederal Government of Pakistan (1994 SCMR 1341),\n\nbecause no relief can be granted to them in these\n\nproceedings as no question of public importance with\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc.\n\n(d)\n\n(e)\n\n(f)\n\n44\n\nreference to enforcement of their any of the\n\nfundamental rights arises;\n\nAs far as the cases of the transfers of the civil\nservants/employees before the completion of tenure\nmade allegedly in violation of the law laid down by\nthis Court in Anita Turab case are concerned, the\nconcerned departments of Federal Government shall\nexamine their individual cases on the touchstone of\nthe principles laid down in the said case. However,\ndecision given on the complaint of any of the\nemployees by this Court alleging violation of the\nprinciples enunciated in the judgment referred to\nhereinabove, shall be deemed to be in accordance\nwith law.\n\nThe appointments in autonomous/semi-autonomous\nbodies, corporations, regulatory authorities, etc.,\nmade before the appointment of Caretaker\nGovernment shall also be subjected to review by the\nelected Government by adopting the prescribed\nprocedure to ensure that right persons are appointed\non the right job, in view of the observations made in\nabove paras (Para. No. 25 & 26); and\n\nThe Federal Government through the concerned\nSecretaries shall take up the issue of postings of 100\nofficers on deputation from Balochistan, as it was\npointed out during the hearing of this case on\n22.05.2013 and accomplish the same, if required, in\n\naccordance with law.\n\n31. The Secretary Establishment is directed to communicate\n\nthis judgment to all other Divisions, Ministries, Organizations, etc. for\n\nimplementation of the same.\n\n32. The case of the Ombudsman be de-linked and it shall be\n\nheard/decided separately in view of the question of interpretation of\n\nlaw on the subject namely, Establishment of the office of Wafaqi\nMohtasib (Ombudsman) Order, 1983.\n\nConst.P.30/13 etc. 45\n\n33. In the result, Constitution Petition No.30 of 2013 partially\nallowed and the titled CMAs as well as CMAs No.2991 & 3015/2013 in\n\nConstitution Petition No.23/2012 are disposed of accordingly.\n\nCHHIEF JUSTICE\n\nJUDGE\n\nJUDGE\nANNOUNCED IN OPEN COURT ON\nAT ISLAMABAD\n\nCHHIEF JUSTICE\nAPPROVED FOR REPORTING", "CleanedText": "JUDGMENT IFTIKHAR MUHAMMAD CHAUDHRY, CJ. This Constitution Petition has been filed under Article 184 3 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan by one of the elected Parliamentarians, namely, Khawaja Muhammad Asif, wherein he has sought the following reliefs: - Declare, in the circumstances aforesaid, the acts of the care-taker government in effecting the aforesaid transfers/postings/shuffling null and void, void ab initio and of no legal effect being in contravention of Constitution, constitutional conventions and law. In the alternative, declare that the aforesaid acts of the care-taker government of passing and signing of the etc. 5 orders affecting the aforesaid transfers/postings/shuffling were never, in fact, signed and/or passed and/or communicated for further necessary action. Direct, in the circumstances aforesaid, that all the postings/transfers/shuffling be reversed and the status quo ante be reverted to, i.e. the position when the care-taker government was sworn in. Direct the Federation/care-taker government to refrain from effecting any further appointments/transfers/shuffling during their remaining tenure. 2. As in CMAs 2991 3015 of 2013 in Constitution Petition No.23 of 2012 identical issues about appointments, transfers and postings, etc., were raised, therefore, a learned Bench of this Court, vide order dated 28.05.2013, referred the said miscellaneous applications to this Bench, to avoid overlapping of the proceedings and/or the possibility of rendering of conflicting judgments on similar issues in the event of parallel proceedings being conducted in two different benches simultaneously. 3. On 22.05.2013 and 04.06.2013, orders were passed and the Secretaries of the concerned Ministries/Divisions of the Federal Government were called upon to furnish details of the Government servants/employees, who were appointed, transferred, posted, etc. Relevant paras there from are reproduced hereinbelow respectively: - Order dated 22.05.2013 3. He has stated that the Caretaker Government has made inter alia following transfers and postings in the civil service, statutory bodies, autonomous or semi autonomous bodies, corporations and regulatory authorities :- a The Chairman of the National Highway Authority, Hamid Ali Khan was replaced, on 16.05.2013, by Sajjad Hussain Baloch; b The Chairman NEPRA was replaced, on 16.05.2013, and Justice R Ahmad Khan Lashari has been appointed; c The Managing Director SNGPL, Arif Hameed was replaced, on 15.05.2013, by Amin Tufail; d The Managing Director SSGCL was replaced, on 15.03.2013, by Rahat Kamal Siddiqui; etc. 6 e The Managing Director, Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation, Khalid Khokhar was replaced by Saifullah Khan; f The Chairman, National Fertilizer, Rizwan Mumtaz Ali was removed on 09.05.2013; g The Managing Director, Oil and Gas Development Corporation, Masood Siddiqui was removed on 06.05.2013; h The Chairman, State Life Corporation was removed on 16.05.2013; i The Chairman, Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation has reportedly been removed and an another appointed in his stead; D The Chairman, Pakistan Software Export Board has been removed and in his stead Saleem Ahmed Ranjha has been appointed who is a direct inductee of Yusuf Raza Gillani the previous Prime Minister; k The Director General, FIA who was appointed one month back is also reportedly in the process of being replaced; 1 That certain employees/officers of the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority have reportedly been removed from service without following the procedure as set out under the relevant statute; m That reportedly many other mid - level staff of such like aforesaid corporation/bodies have been shuffled/ transferred/removed . 7. We do allow the learned Attorney General for Pakistan to take instructions from the Government but in view of the importance of the issue involved in the petition, we direct that: - all the appointments, transfers and postings, which have been made by the Caretaker Government, referred to hereinabove, shall stand suspended and till pendency of this petition no further appointment, transfer and posting shall be made by the Caretaker Government including the appointment of Federal Ombudsman, Tax Ombudsman and Anti-Dumping Tribunal, except the postings and transfers, which relate to day-to-day business of the government and are required to be made in the interest of State and also to watch the interest of public, strictly following the rules and regulations on the subject, and in a transparent manner. Order dated 04.06.2013 2. Khawaja Muhammad Asif, petitioner, appeared in person and stated that the order dated 22.05.2013 has not been complied with in letter and spirit inasmuch as the Caretaker Government without lawful authority terminated the services of some of those officers who were already working and performing their duties in Finance Division and I.T., either as Advisors or on contract. As duly elected government is likely to take over within a day or so and etc. 7 budget is likely to be prepared shortly, therefore, due to unlawful action of Caretaker Government concerned Divisions are facing a lot of difficulties. He has further stated that about more than 100 officers have been sent on deputation to different organizations from the Province of Balochistan after 22.4 May, 2013 without adhering to the rules and regulations knowing well that the orders relating to the policy making cannot be passed by the Caretaker Government. 4. Since all these issues are important in nature, therefore, we direct the Secretaries, Establishment, Cabinet, Health, Water Power, Finance Division s and all other concerned Departments/Corporations to file lists of the officers a who were appointed against any post by the Caretaker Government after taking over including Chairmen etc of the Corporations whose list finds mention in the order dated 22.05.2013; b whose services were acquired on deputation from different organizations on different positions in the Departments and Corporations controlled by the Federal Government; c whose services were terminated because they were holding different positions on contract basis in all the Government Departments/Hospitals; d Whose transfers have been made contrary to the Judgment of Anita Turab s case, etc; e Deputationists brought to Federal Government Departments from the Province of Balochistan. In response to the above orders, summary of the transfers, postings, termination of service/contract of the employees was submitted vide CMA No.3515/2013, which reads as under: - STATEMENT INDICATING POSTINGS/TRANSFERS/APPOINTMENTS MADE BY THE CARETAKER GOVERNMENT Sl.

It may be mentioned here that in the order dated 22.05.2013 it had been observed that any individual whose posting, appointment or transfer was suspended and he was aggrieved of the said order, he might come forward by making application s , which would be dealt with after hearing him/them. 5. It may be observed that learned Attorney General informed that Justice R Faqir Muhammad Khokar, Chairman AntiDumping Appellate Tribunal, Justice R Ahmed Khan Lashari, Chairman NEPRA and Justice R Kalash Nath Kohli, Chairman Sacked Employees Review Board have tendered resignations, which are under process, except the resignation of Chairman Anti-Dumping Tribunal, which has already been accepted on 31.05.2013. Mr. Sher Afzal, Joint Secretary is directed that no sooner their resignations are accepted, he may inform the Court. 6. Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the elected Parliamentary Government is responsible to achieve the object of good governance and in continuance of the same, it is obliged to post suitable persons being in the employment of the Government/private sector to head various departments, corporations and organizations controlled by the Government to run their result-oriented administration, as such elected Government has to fulfill the object and purpose of welfare of the citizens. The Caretaker Government, which is installed for a limited period of 2/3 months with the object of etc. 9 assisting the Election Commission of Pakistan in organizing fair, free, honest and just elections, cannot be considered to be the replacement of the elected Government. As such, the Caretaker Government is debarred from making large scale transfers, postings, re-shuffling of the Government employees, having far reaching effects/impact on the administration, commercial and industrial departments/organizations, because if a person is appointed against an important position, and his performance is not found suitable or it is not in accordance with the policies of the elected Government, it would not be possible for the Government to implement its policies. He further argued that the Caretaker Government had also exceeded its authority in assigning the reasons that the appointments, postings, transfers, reshuffling, etc., have been made following the directions/observations contained in the letter dated 02.04.2013 of the Election Commission of Pakistan. 7. Learned Attorney General for Pakistan did not address arguments on the issues involved in these cases as such and only confined to making certain references to the record, e.g., CMA 2676 2770/2013 in Constitution Petition No.23/2012 filed pursuant to the Court s directions as well as CMA No.3514/2013, etc., filed in the case. 8. In pursuance of this Court s order dated 22.05.2013, various individuals filed applications seeking relief against their postings, transfers, etc. and such of the applicants, who were present in Court, were also afforded opportunity of hearing. Some of them did not press their applications and requests so made by them were allowed.

It is to be observed that the other learned Bench of this Court, while hearing Constitution Petitions No.23/2013 on 09.05.2013 was, prima facie, of the opinion that notification of the Election Commission dated 02.04.2013 did not provide any valid justification, much less a compelling reason, so as to justify the transfers, postings, etc., in question. The contents of notification of the ECP are reproduced hereinbelow: - ELECTION COMMISSION OF PAKISTAN NOTIFICATION Islamabad the 2 April, 2013 No.F.8 12 /2012-Cord 1 - WHEREAS it is expedient to ensure that all those who are in the service of Pakistan perform their duties to serve public interest and assist the etc. 14 Election Commission of Pakistan in the conduct of General Elections 2013 fairly, justly, honestly and in accordance with law; AND WHEREAS it is also expedient to take pre-emptive steps so that no employee in the service of Pakistan should try to influence the election process in any manner to favour any particular political party or a candidate; NOW THEREFORE, in exercise of the powers conferred upon it under Article 218 3 of the Constitution read with sections 103 c and 104 of the Representation of the People Act 1976, the directions dated 08.06.2012 of the Supreme Court of Pakistan in Workers Party Pakistan s case and all other powers enabling it in that behalf, the Election Commission of Pakistan is pleased to direct the Federal and Provincial Caretaker Governments to: i Shuffle/transfer all Federal and Provincial Secretaries. However, if the caretaker government considers that a federal or provincial secretary need not be transferred/shuffled, it may refrain from doing so and intimate the same to the Election Commission. ii ji Assess whether the Chairpersons / Chief Executives of all autonomous and semi-autonomous and/or state owned bodies, IG Police, CCPOs, City Commissioners, DCOs, DPOs, SHOs, patwaris and EDOs are independent individuals and transfer those who do not meet this criteria. 2. Clauses iii and iv of this Commission s Notification No.8 12 /2012-Cord 1 dated 26th March, 2013 are hereby withdrawn. This directive shall not apply to specific transfers made under the directions of the Election Commission. By Order of the Election Commission of Pakistan. Sd/- Syed Sher Afgan Acting Secretary 10. A perusal of the above notification suggests that it was issued by the ECP under Article 218 3 of the Constitution read with sections 103 c and 104 of the Representation of the People Act, 1976 and the directions dated 08.06.2012 of this Court issued in Worker s etc. 15 Party Pakistan v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 2012 SC 681 and all other powers enabling it in that behalf, directing the Federal and Provincial Caretaker Governments to transfer/shuffle all Federal and Provincial Secretaries. However, if the Caretaker Government considered that a Federal or Provincial Secretary need not be transferred/shuffled, it would refrain from doing so and intimate the same to the ECP. We tend to agree with the learned counsel for the petitioner that under the notification noted hereinabove; the Caretaker Government had been authorized not to transfer/shuffle any Government servant, if it considered that it was not expedient to do so. But, at any rate, no powers were given to requisition the services of the employees on deputation or make fresh appointments against the available vacancies, or make proforma promotions of officials of all grades in autonomous and semi-autonomous bodies, corporations, regulatory authorities, statutory bodies, government controlled corporations, etc. 11. It is to be seen that the Caretaker Cabinet/Prime Minister were installed in the Federation and Provinces in the month of March, 2013 after dissolution of the National and the Provincial Assemblies on completion of their respective terms provided under Article 224 1 1A of the Constitution, which read as under: - 224. Time of election and bye-election. 1 A general election to the National Assembly or a Provincial Assembly shall be held within a period of sixty days immediately following the day on which the term of the Assembly is due to expire, unless the Assembly has been sooner dissolved, and the results of the election shall be declared not later than fourteen days before that day. 1A On dissolution of the Assembly on completion of its term, or in case it is dissolved under Article 58 or Article 112, the President, or the Governor, as the case may be, shall appoint a caretaker Cabinet: etc. 16 Provided that the care-taker Prime Minister shall be appointed by the President in consultation with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in the outgoing National Assembly, and a care-taker Chief Minister shall be appointed by the Governor in consultation with the Chief Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in the outgoing Provincial Assembly: Provided further that if the Prime Minister or a Chief Minister and their respective Leader of the Opposition do not agree on any person to be appointed as a care-taker Prime Minister or the care-taker Chief Minister, as the case may be, the provisions of Article 224A shall be followed : Provided also that the Members of the Federal and Provincial care-taker Cabinets shall be appointed on the advice of the care-taker Prime Minister or the care-taker Chief Minister, as the case may be. 12. As in instant case the Caretaker Prime Minister could not be appointed in terms of Article 224 1A of the Constitution for want of consensus between the former elected Prime Minister and the Leader of the House, therefore, the provisions of Article 224A of the Constitution were invoked, and ultimately on account of inability of the Committee constituted under Article 224A 1 2 to decide the matter, the names of the nominees were referred to the Election Commission of Pakistan for finalizing the name of the caretaker Prime Minister within two days, thus, as a result of deliberations by the ECP, Caretaker Prime Minister was appointed in accordance with the provisions of Articles 224 1A and 224A 1 2 of the Constitution. 13. Essentially, according to the settled and accepted norms/practice, the Caretaker Government Prime Minister and Cabinet is required to perform its functions to attend to the day-today matters, which are necessary to run the affairs of the State and also to watch the national interests, etc., in any eventuality in absence of an elected Government, and such Government is not authorized to etc. 17 make decisions/appointments having effect on the working/policies of the future Government, which is likely to take over after the elections. Apart from providing assistance to the Election Commission in organizing free, fair, honest and just elections in the country, it is not vested with the authority to take decisions concerning the affairs of the Government, which are bound to pre-empt the scope and sphere of activity, powers and jurisdiction of an elected Government. A Caretaker Government possesses limited powers and authority particularly in view of the fact that when it is appointed, there is no National Assembly in place and thus the all important aspect of accountability is absent. Further, the exercise of complete powers by the Caretaker Government goes against the doctrine of separation of powers which is the lifeline of any vibrant democracy. As noted earlier, the absence of legislature results in lack of checks and balances. The Caretaker Government also lacks the mandate of the majority of people, which is to be acquired by elected government through the general elections. Therefore, if a Caretaker Government is allowed to exercise complete powers available to an elected Government, it may make an attempt to continue to remain in office for a longer period of time or may take such decisions which may cause problems for the future elected government. 14. As per the scheme of the Constitution, prior to the 18 Constitutional Amendment, where the President dissolved the National Assembly under Article 48 5 , he shall, in his discretion, appoint caretaker Cabinet. Similarly, if the President, dissolves the National Assembly on the advice of the Prime Minister, he is required to put in place an interim set up or a temporary arrangement to ensure the etc. 18 continuity of the functions of the Government to run day-to-day affairs of the State till the appointment of duly elected Government with its Cabinet after completion of the election process. Unfortunately, after the promulgation of the Constitution of 1973, during the Martial Law regime of General R Zia-ul-Haq in 1985, by means of the 8th Constitutional Amendment, an infamous provision, namely, Article 58 2 b was inserted into the Constitution, which provided that the President may dissolve the National Assembly in his discretion where, in his opinion, a situation has arisen in which the Government of the Federation cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and an appeal to the electorate is necessary. The said provision was later deleted by means of Thirteenth Constitutional Amendment in 1997. During the next Martial Law regime of General R Pervez Musharraf, the same was again inserted through the 17 Constitutional Amendment passed in 2003. However, after the restoration of democratic governance in the country, the new elected Government again deleted the said provision from the Constitution through the 18 Constitutional Amendment passed in 2010. It is to be noted that in exercise of the powers under the said provision, for more than one time, the National Assembly was dissolved and the elected Prime Minister/Cabinet were removed, and caretaker Prime Minister and Cabinet were appointed. 15. The object and purpose of making reference to these provisions is to highlight that the functions of the elected Government have remained under serious threats. At the same time, it is also significant to point out that despite appointment of the Caretaker Prime Minister/Cabinet, no guidelines were ever provided laying down etc. 19 the parameters to be observed by the Caretaker Governments in the exercise of their powers. As far as Constitution is concerned, Article 2A envisages that State shall exercise its powers and authority through the chosen representatives of the people and a comprehensive procedure, including qualifications and the disqualifications for the persons to be elected as Members of Majlis-e-Shoora Parliament has been prescribed. Thus, it is the chosen representatives of the people who have to run the affairs of the State for a fixed term of five years. Such representatives of the people are required to ensure good governance, lay down policies, and ensure betterment of the general public through legislative and executive actions. On the contrary, a Caretaker Government as compared to an elected Government remains in office for a very limited period whose first and last concern is to ensure that fair, free, honest and just elections are held in the country. The concept of caretaker or interim Government, in absence of an elected government is in vogue in a number of countries since the ancient times. Inasmuch as, in the Constitution of some of the countries, the concept of caretaker government does not specifically find a place, yet the practice of appointing caretaker government is in vogue those countries. Such countries include India, Australia, Canada, Bangladesh, Holland, New Zealand, UK, etc. With the passage of time, all those countries have developed Constitutional conventions, on the basis of which the caretaker governments are put in place to run the affairs of the State during the interim period, i.e. till returning to power of the duly elected governments having full powers and such caretaker governments do not, in general, take any major policy decisions, including making appointments of civil servants, etc., etc. 20 particularly in the manner it has been done by the Caretaker Government that had come into existence on completion of the term of the previous Government. 16. At this stage, reference may be made to the Constitutional system of Australia. As per the scheme of the Australian Constitution, the caretaker government is expected to conduct itself in accordance with a series of conventions administered by the department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, although there is no law compelling the caretaker government to do so. Usually, there is no separate appointment of a caretaker government and the outgoing government continues to function as caretaker government. During the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, the then Governor-General appointed a new government with the assurance that it would immediately advise a general election, and it would operate on a caretaker basis in the meantime. The political system of Australia ensures that a Cabinet is always maintained and that caretaker governments abide by the conventions. Any flouting of the conventions by a caretaker government would immediately come to light, and could go against them in the election campaign. In this regard, a document titled Guidance on Caretaker Conventions has been administered by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Section 1.2 of the Caretaker Conventions provides that a caretaker government operates until the election result clearly indicates that either the incumbent party has retained power, or in the case where there is to be a change of government, until the new government is appointed by the Governor-General. The relevant clauses of the guidelines are reproduced hereinbelow: - etc. 21 3. SIGNIFICANT APPOINTMENTS 3.1 Governments defer making significant appointments during the caretaker period. When considering the advice it would give on whether an appointment qualifies as significant , the agency should consider not only the importance of the position, but also whether the proposed appointment would be likely to be controversial. 3.2 If deferring the appointment is impracticable, usually for reasons associated with the proper functioning of an agency, there are several options: the Minister could make an acting appointment where permissible; the Minister could make a short term appointment until shortly after the end of the caretaker period; or if those options are not practicable, the Minister could consult the relevant Opposition spokesperson regarding a full term appointment. In Canada too, Guidelines on the Conduct of Ministers, Secretaries of State, Exempt Staff and Public Servants during an Election have been issued which provide, inter alia, as under: - GUIDELINES ON THE CONDUCT OF MINISTERS, SECRETARIES OF STATE, EXEMPT STAFF AND PUBLIC SERVANTS DURING AND ELECTION This does not mean that government is absolutely barred from making decisions of announcements, or otherwise taking action, during an election. It can and should do so where the matter is routine and necessary for the conduct of government business, or where it is urgent and in the public interest - for example, responding to a natural disaster. In certain cases where a major decision is unavoidable during a campaign e.g., due to an international obligation or an emergency , consultation with the Opposition may be appropriate, particularly where a major decision could be controversial or difficult for a new government to reverse. Contracts, G Cs and Appointment Appointments should normally be deferred. The Prime Minister s Office must be consulted before making any commitments concerning appointments that cannot be deferred. etc. 22 As far as UK is concerned, they have also issued similar guidelines in 2010. Relevant guidelines are reproduced hereinbelow: - SECTION G Government Decisions 1. During an election campaign the Government retains its responsibility to govern and Ministers remain in charge of their Departments. Essential business must be carried on. In particular Cabinet Committees can continue to meet and consider correspondence if necessary, although in practice this may not be practical. If something requires urgent collective consideration, the Cabinet Secretariat should be consulted. 2. However, it is customary for Ministers to observe discretion in initiating any new action of a continuing or long-term character. Decisions on matters of policy, and other issues such as large and/or contentious procurement contracts, on which a new Government might be expected to want the opportunity to take a different view from the present Government should be postponed until after the Election, provided that such postponement would not be detrimental to the national interest or wasteful of public money. SECTION H Public and Senior Civil Service Appointments 1. All appointments requiring approval by the Prime Minister, other Civil Service and public appointments likely to prove sensitive, including those where Ministers have delegated decisions to officials or other authorities, such as appointments to certain NHS boards , should effectively be frozen until after the Election. This applies to appointments where a candidate has already accepted a written offer. The individual concerned should be told that the appointment will be subject to confirmation by the new Administration after the Election. 2. It is recognised that, should this procedure result in the cancellation or substantial delay of an appointment by the new Administration, the relevant Department could be vulnerable to legal action by a disappointed candidate who had already accepted a written offer. To reduce the risk of this happening, Departments might wish to: recommend to their Secretary of State the advisability either of delaying key stages in the process, or of consulting the Opposition e.g. on a short-list of candidates or a single name for final selection where an appointment is likely to take effect just before or after an election; etc. 23 issue a conditional letter of offer, making it clear that the formal offer of the appointment will need to be confirmed by a new Administration. 3. In cases where an appointment is due to end between the announcement of the Election and Election Day, and no announcement has been made concerning the new appointment, it will normally be possible for the post to be left vacant until incoming Ministers have been able to take a decision either about re-appointment of the existing appointee or the appointment of a new person. This situation is also likely to apply to any appointments made by Letters Patent, or otherwise requiring Royal approval, since it would not be appropriate to invite Her Majesty to make a conditional appointment. 4. In the case of public and Senior Civil Service appointments, Departments should delay the launch of any open competition during an election period, to give any incoming Administration the option of deciding whether to follow the existing approach. 5. In those cases where an appointment is required to be made, it is acceptable, in the case of sensitive Senior Civil Service positions, to allow temporary promotion or substitution. In the case of public appointments, the current term may be extended to cover the Election period, or as required, with the prior approval of the Commissioner for Public Appointments. This will allow time for new Ministers to take a decision about longer term appointment. In any cases of doubt, and particularly where circumstances make it difficult to apply these temporary arrangements, Departments should consult the Propriety and Ethics Team in the Cabinet Office. The Cabinet Manual: A guide to laws, conventions and rules on the operation of government, 1 edition, October 2011 provides, inter alia, as under: - PARLIAMENT 7. Parliament has a number of functions, which include: controlling national expenditure and taxation; making law; scrutinising executive action; being the source from which the Government is drawn; and debating the issues of the day. All areas of the UK are represented in the House of Commons, which provides a forum for Members of Parliament MPs to speak and correspond on behalf of their constituents, where they can seek redress if necessary. etc. 24 17. 8. Parliament comprises the Sovereign in Parliament and two Houses: the House of Commons, which is wholly elected, and the House of Lords, which comprises the Lords Spiritual and Temporal. Parliament has overall control of the public purse; the Government may not levy taxes, raise loans or spend public money unless and until it has authorisation from Parliament. The House of Commons claims exclusive rights and privileges over the House of Lords in relation to financial matters, and the powers of the House of Lords to reject legislation passed by the House of Commons are limited by statute. 9. In the exercise of its legislative powers, Parliament is sovereign. In practice, however, Parliament has chosen to be constrained in various ways - through its Acts, and by elements of European and other international law. 10. Parliament also scrutinises executive action. Indeed, the government of the day is primarily responsible to Parliament for its day-to-day actions. This function is exercised through a variety of mechanisms, such as the select committee system, Parliamentary questions, oral and written statements, debates in both Houses and the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration. See Chapter Five for more on Parliament. Emphasis supplied 11. By the Scotland Act 1998, the Government of Wales Acts 1998 and 2006 and the Northern Ireland Act 1998, Parliament devolved powers over areas of domestic policy such as housing, health and education to directly elected legislatures in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Parliament retains the legal power to continue to legislate on these matters, but it does not normally do so without the consent of these devolved legislatures. See Chapter Eight for more on devolution. Coming to the case in hand, it may be mentioned here that this is not the first time that this Court is confronted with such a situation. Earlier too, identical matters have been dealt with by the Superior Courts of Pakistan. In the case of Khawaja Muhammad Sharif v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 1988 Lahore 725 wherein the Lahore High Court held that caretaker Cabinets have to confine themselves to take care of the day-to-day administration of the State. Relevant portion of the judgment reads as under: - etc. 25 26. The learned Attorney-General submitted that it is quite correct that Caretaker Cabinets have to take care of the day-to-day administration of the State. There may be no bar to take policy decisions if so required by the circumstances. He is right. Caretaker Cabinets have to confine themselves to take care of the day-to-day administration of the State. They can take all decisions requiring attention or action, may be having far-reaching effects, like in respect of war and peace or earthquake or floods. But they can neither forget the predominant position of their being Caretaker nor can they take undue advantage of their position either for themselves or for their political parties. They have to be impartial to everybody, including their rivals or opponents in the political fields. They cannot take advantage of their official position of Caretaker Government at the expense of other political forces or people at large. Neutrality, impartiality, detachment and devotion to duty to carry on day-to-day affairs of the State without keeping in view one s own interest or of one s party are the sine qua non of a Caretaker Cabinet. Emphasis supplied In the case of Regional Commissioner of Income Tax v. Zaffar Hussain PLD 1992 SC 869 Mr. Justice R Abdul Shakurul Salam J., in his dissenting note held as under: - 3. The following points are obvious and noteworthy. Firstly, that when the leader of the Opposition became care-taker Prime Minister, displeasure or rancour of the Opposition was given vent to by ordering the removal of the respondents from their service. It was rather petty. Secondly, as far as the authority of the Care-taker Cabinet is concerned, I had said in the case of Muhammad Sharif v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 1988 Lahore 725 in the Lahore High Court that Care-taker Cabinets have to confine themselves to take care of the day to day administration of the State. They can take all decisions requiring attention or action, may be having far-reaching effects, like in respect of war and peace or earthquake or floods. But they can neither forget the predominant position of their being Care-taker nor can they take undue advantage of their position either for themselves or for their political parties. They have to be impartial to everybody, including their rivals or opponents in the political fields. They cannot take advantage of their official position of care-taker Government at the expense of other political forces or people at large. Neutrality, impartiality, detachment and devotion to duty to carry on day to day affairs of the State without keeping in view one s own interest or of one s own party are the sine qua non of a Care-taker Cabinet. The judgment was upheld by this etc. 26 Court in Federation of Pakistan v. Haji Muhammad Saifullah Khan and others PLD 1989 SC 166 . The action of removal of the respondents clearly did not fall within the scope or ambit of the Care-taker Cabinet whose primary function was to hold election and carry on day to day administration with the civil servants available and not to throw out those who had been given employment by the previously elected Government. Emphasis supplied In the case of Tanveer A. Qureshi v. President of Pakistan PLD 1997 Lahore 263 it has been held as under: - 26. Another principal attack on the formation of the C.D.N.S. by the petitioner was that the decision to set up such a council being of great importance and a matter of policy could not have been taken by the Caretaker Cabinet appointed under Article 48 5 of the Constitution. It was emphasised by Mr. Talib H. Rizvi, as also Mr. Abdul Rehman Cheema that the life of the Caretaker Cabinet being for 90 days it cannot take decisions of permanent nature but its activities are confined only to running dayto-day affairs of the Government and should be geared towards holding of free and fair elections. Reliance has been placed on Kh. Muhammad Sharif v. Federation of Pakistan and 18 others PLD 1988 Lah. 725, Federation of Pakistan etc. v. Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao and others PLD 1992 SC 723 and Madan Murari Verma v. Ch. Charan Singh and another AIR 1980 Calcutta 95. 28. Article 48 5 of the Constitution enjoins the President to appoint a caretaker Cabinet to run the affairs of the country pending the elections to the National Assembly and formation of Government. The use of word Caretaker is not without significance and has to be given some meaning. The argument of the learned Attorney-General and Mr. Sharif-ud-Din Pirzada that Caretaker signifies the temporary nature of the tenure appears to be attractive and coming from a jurist like Mr. Sharif-ud-Din Pirzada is entitled to great respect but with due deference we are unable to agree with them. A Cabinet appointed by the Prime Minister to run the affairs of the country till the next General Elections by its very nature is temporary and the life of it is limited by the Constitution itself till the next General Elections which are to be held within 90 days. It was thus not necessary to use the word Caretaker to indicate temporary nature of the tenure. On the other hand we are of the view that this word has been used in Article 48 5 to emphasises the purpose of appointment end the nature of the power available to the Caretaker Government. ... ... etc. 27 30. wo. Although no hard and fast rules can be laid down in respect of the, powers available to the Caretaker Cabinet to take decisions as the answer would depend upon facts of each case but generally speaking a major policy-decision which can await the formation of regularly elected Government without causing any disruption or danger to the functioning of the State or orderly running of the country should be left to be determined by the elected representatives of the people, moreso when the Caretaker Cabinet cannot claim to have been given any mandate by the people. There may not be any express restriction on the powers of the Caretaker Cabinet by the Constitution itself but the conclusion reached by us flows from the use of words Caretaker Cabinet in Article 48 5 of the Constitution as also very nature of the Caretaker Cabinet and the purpose for which it has been appointed. In the case of Khawaja Ahmad Tariq Rahim v. the Federation of Pakistan PLD 1992 SC 646 , this Court held as under: - Be ae The object of the Care-taker Cabinet is to fill a temporary void, so that it may conduct day to day administration, without getting involved in matters of substantive importance or policy or subjects having farreaching effects, other than during an emergency or some urgency, till the new Government is installed. Above all, it is not supposed to influence the elections or do or cause to be done anything whereby which Government machinery or funds are channelled in favour of any political party. In the case of Madan Murari Verma v. Choudhuri Charan Singh AIR 1980 Cal 95 , the Court held as under: - The President has accepted the resignation of the respondent No. 1 and his Council of Ministers and has asked them to continue in office till other arrangements are made . It is the limited pleasure indicated and in that field only in my opinion the respondent No. 1 and his Council of Ministers can function. There is no mention of any care-taker Government as such, in our Constitution or in the constitutional law, though Sir Ivor Jennings has described in his book -- Cabinet Government, Third Ed. p. 85 the ministry that was formed by Mr. Churchill in England after the war before and pending the General election in 1945 as care-taker Government. But an extraodinary situation like the present, in my opinion, calls for a care-taker Government and therefore, the respondent No. 1 and his Council of Ministers can only carry on day-today administration in office which are necessary for carrying on for making alternative arrangements . In etc. 28 effect the President, in my opinion is therefore, not obliged to accept the advice that the respondent No. 1 and his Council of Ministers tender to him except for day-to-day administration and the Council of Ministers and the respondent No. 1 should not make any decisions which are not necessary except for the purpose of carrying on the administration until other arrangements are made. This in effect means that any decision or policy decision or any matter which can await disposal by the Council of Ministers responsible to the House of People must not be tendered by the respondent number 1 and his Council of Ministers. With this limitation the respondent No. 1 and the Council of Ministers can only function. And in case whether such advice is necessary to carry on the day-to-day administration till other arrangements are made or beyond that, the President, in my opinion, is free to judge. It is true again that this gives the President powers which have not been expressly conferred by the Constitution. But, in my opinion, having regard to the basic principle behind this Constitution under Article 75 3 read with Article 74 1 in the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case is the only legitimate, legal and workable conclusion that can be made. In the case of R. Krishnaiah v. State Of Andhra Pradesh AIR 2005 AP 10 it was held that: - 10. In support of his submissions learned Counsel placed reliance on the recommendations of the Sarkaria Commission referred to by a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in S.R. Bommai and Ors. etc., etc. v. Union of India and Ors. etc., etc., , more particularly, recommendation No. 6-8-04 A that after dissolution of the Assembly and till new Government takes over, during the interim period, the Caretaker Government should be allowed to function. But as a matter of convention, Caretaker Government should merely carry on day-to-day Government and desist from taking any major policy decision. He thus urged that issuing Ordinance permitting to withdraw amount from the Consolidated Fund of the State of Andhra Pradesh to meet a the grants made in advance in respect of the estimated expenditure for a part of the financial year commencing on the 1st April, 2004 as set forth in Column 3 of the Schedule appended to the Ordinance and b the expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund of the State of Andhra Pradesh, for the part of the same financial year, as set forth in Column 4 of the Schedule, is nothing but a major policy decision which ought not to have been taken. 16. Therefore, the submission that the Ordinance could not have been promulgated is misconceived. Ordinance has the same force and effect as any Act of the State etc. 29 Legislature and there is no prohibition in the Constitution that during the period an Assembly is dissolved and fresh Assembly has not yet been constituted, that Ordinance could not have been promulgated by the Governor. This act of the Governor will be deemed to be an exercise of power of the Legislative Assembly, as envisaged under Article 206 and even under Article 205 and as noticed above. Clause 3 of Article 203 is a prohibition not to withdraw from the Consolidated Fund any amount being subject to provisions of Articles 205 and 206 of the Constitution. The Ordinance having validly been promulgated there is hardly any force in the other submission that a situation has arisen where power must be exercised or directed to be exercised by the President of India under Articles 356 or 360 of the Constitution. 18. The crux of the above case-law and conventions/guidelines is that the Caretaker Government/Cabinet has to confine itself to the running of the day-to-day administration of the State. Indeed, it may take decisions required for ordinary orderly running of the state, but decisions having far-reaching effects should only be taken in extraordinary circumstances, like in war, earthquake, floods, etc. Although there may not be any express restriction on the powers of the caretaker government by the Constitution itself, but a major policy-decision which can await the formation of regularly elected Government without causing any disruption or danger to the functioning of the State or orderly running of the country should be left to be determined by the elected government. Thus, there can be no two opinions that the caretaker government has to exercise the powers for a limited purpose as it has been highlighted hereinabove, namely, relating to the elections and not to make fresh appointments of the civil servants or make appointments of the heads of the Autonomous, Semi-Autonomous Bodies, Corporations, Regulatory Authorities, etc., appointments on contract basis or allowing deputation or promotion to the civil servants without realizing the etc. 30 scope of their efficacy to share higher responsibilities to run the affairs of the Government. 19. In the context of instant case, besides relying upon the guidelines in the judgments noted hereinabove, one may conveniently pose a question, particularly in view of Article 48 5 of the Constitution and other constitutional provisions, as to why a caretaker cabinet/government appointed under Article 224 or as the case may under Article 224A of the Constitution, should not exercise powers available to a duly elected government? Answer to this question lies in the expression Interim Cabinet used in Article 48 5 of the Constitution, which enables to draw the inference that the interim Cabinet or caretaker Cabinet headed by a Prime Minister means a caretaker cabinet or a government, which has been entrusted temporary charge of government during the period when the National Assembly is dissolved because ordinarily for a period of five years under Article 58, the National Assembly exists for the purpose of running the affairs of the State and in absence of elected Parliament, continuity of the governance system in the country has to be kept intact, otherwise running the affairs of the State would not be possible at all. In addition to it, although in our country in respect of the powers of the caretaker government no conventions have been developed and for such reasons the instant Caretaker Government indulged in taking vital policy decisions and making postings and appointments of heads of statutory bodies, postings and appointments in civil service, statutory bodies, autonomous, semi-autonomous bodies, corporations and regulatory authorities, including appointments on contract or accepting the services of various persons etc. 31 on deputation by allowing them to occupy one step higher positions than the one, which they were holding previously. 20. Petitioner Khawaja Muhammad Asif appeared and pointed out that caretaker government had made transfers/postings in civil service, statutory bodies, autonomous, semi-autonomous bodies, corporations and regulatory authorities, etc., the list of which has been made part of the record. 21. The learned Attorney General while appearing in Constitution Petitions No.14 of 2013, etc., made a statement, already mentioned in the order dated 22.05.2013, which is reproduced hereinbelow: - 12. That the federation is already on record in taking up a principled stand before this Hon ble Court that the caretaker government needs only to confine their work to day to day routine matters and effectively maintain the status quo for the incoming elected government, while submitting the views of the federation vide a CMA filed in Constitutional Petition Nos.14, 16 to 18 of 2013. It is submitted that vide the said CMA the Attorney General submitted that the care-taker government should avoid taking and controversial step and should not commit any process that is not reversible by the incoming elected government and further that the care-taker government should restrict itself to activity that is a routine, b noncontroversial, c urgent and in public interest, d reversible by the elected government; and e any significant appointment thereby avoiding any major decisions except agreed to by the opposition. 13. That the learned Attorney General whilst representing the case of the federation in the foresaid constitutional petitions also relied upon Australian Caretaker Conventions etc. 32 and highlighted that the key elements of the code of conduct should include: a avoiding major policy decisions, b avoiding any significant appointments, c signing any major contract, d avoiding international treaty or commitment, etc. It was in the same light that the learned Attorney General submitted before this Hon ble Court that the caretaker government had deferred some items of the Council of Common Interests CCI in a recently held meeting and was not, therefore, making any binding decisions/commitments with IMF, World Bank or any other donor agency and had further decided not to enter into any binding agreement or treaty to bind the future elected government. It is submitted, therefore, that the care-taker government having earlier taken a principled stand cannot thereafter be allowed to recuse from the same. Similarly, the Law Minister of the Caretaker Government also objected to the appointments, which were being made directly or indirectly under the verbal or written directions/observations of the caretaker Prime Minister or Cabinet Ministers or the heads of different Departments, Divisions, Ministries, etc. Relevant extract from his statement was published in Daily Dawan, Islamabad dated 19.05.2013, which is reproduced hereinbelow: - u caretaker Law Minister Ahmar Bilal Soofi has also criticised the postings and transfers being made by the government of Prime Minister retired Justice Mir Hazar Khan Khoso. He warned the caretaker set-up against transgressing its mandate by making undue transfers and postings in important government departments. In a letter to his cabinet colleagues a copy of which he also sent to the Prime Minister Secretariat and the establishment secretary, Mr Soofi said: Cabinet members etc. 33 should abide by the legal limitation they enjoy under the constitution. They should not trespass the mandate of the interim government. I would again reiterate that we may continue the prevalent transparency and may not take action which may be counter-productive to the important role performed by the caretaker government. Talking to Dawn on Sunday, the law minister confirmed that he had highlighted in the letter the issue of unnecessary postings and transfers being carried out by some of his colleagues in the cabinet. But he did not mention any specific posting or transfer. He said the letter had been dispatched on Saturday. In his letter Mr Soofi has also mentioned the cancellation of contract of two officials of the information ministry and the recent replacement of the National Highway Authority s chairman. The letter also referred to a statement he had earlier made in cabinet that it was advisable to avoid making controversial appointments in major departments and leave them to the elected government. 22. We consider it appropriate to make reference of the case titled as In re: Abdul Jabbar Memon 1996 SCMR 1349 wherein it has been observed that the Federal Government, Provincial Governments, Statutory Bodies and the Public Authorities have been making initial recruitments, both ad-hoc and regular, to posts and offices without publicly and properly advertising the vacancies and at times by converting ad-hoc appointments into regular appointments. It was held that this practice is prima facie violative of Fundamental Right enshrined in Article 18 of the Constitution guaranteeing to every citizen freedom of profession, which must be discontinued forthwith and immediate steps should be taken to rectify the situation, so as to bring the practice in accord with the Constitutional requirement. But unfortunately it has been noticed that the guidelines/principles have neither been followed by the duly elected governments in the past nor by the caretaker governments. Inasmuch as, principle of transparency etc. 34 has not been adhered to in the appointments of the Members of the Federal Public Service Commission under the Ordinance of 1977 to conduct tests/examinations for recruitment of persons to all Pakistan Services, Civil Services of the Federation and civil posts in connection with the affairs of the Federation and Provinces. No transparent system is in place to ensure merit-based selection of persons for appointment as the heads of the autonomous, semi-autonomous bodies, corporations, organizations, etc. Record available in archives would indicate that except for a shorter period, despite presence and availability of renowned knowledgeable and reputable personalities, these vacancies were allowed to be occupied by persons having connections with the higher functionaries of the State, who openly indulged in favourtism and nepotism. In such a scenario, how the object of making appointments on merit could be achieved, including by the elected government. 23. It is to be noted that reportedly there are more than 100 organizations/corporations, which are causing colossal loss of trillion of rupees to the public exchequer, like Pakistan International Airline, Pakistan Railways, Pakistan Steel Mills, PEPCO, PASCO, Utility Stores Corporations, OGDCL, NEPRA, PEMRA, PTA, KESC, SSGPL, NICL, etc. It is a fundamental right of the citizens of Pakistan under Article 9 of the Constitution that the national wealth/resources must remain fully protected whether they are under the control of the banks or the autonomous and semi-autonomous bodies. 24. There are cases where favorites were appointed despite lacking merits to hold such posts/positions. Reference may be made to the case of Adnan A. Khawaja v. The State etc. 35 2012 SCMR 1434 where a convict, who was acquitted of criminal charges taking benefit of NRO, was appointed as the head of OGDCL. Similarly, in the case of Mir Muhammad Idris v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 2011 SC 213 , the validity of the reappointment of Syed Ali Raza as President of the National Bank of Pakistan for fifth time for one year was challenged. The Court declared the said reappointment to be unconstitutional. Relevant para therefrom is reproduced hereinbelow: - 11. ... Since, admittedly, the amendment made in section 11 3 d of the Act of 1974 by the Finance Act, 2007 was unconstitutional and illegal, the appointment of respondent No.3 made under an unconstitutional and illegal legislation would not remain unaffected as the foundation on which its superstructure rested stood removed. The argument of the learned counsel for respondent No. 3 that the appointment of respondent No.3 was made by the Federal Government in exercise of the power conferred upon it by a legislative instrument passed by the concerned legislature, therefore, the same was not liable to be interfered with being a past and closed transaction is not tenable. If the appointments of Judges were affected on account of a similar defect in legislation, how the appointment of respondent No.3, who, too, was appointed under such an unconstitutional and. illegal amendment could be protected. 13. .. The reappointment of respondent No.3 Syed Ali Raza as President NBP by way of notification dated 10.4.2010 is declared to be unconstitutional and he shall cease to hold office as President NBP with immediate effect. In the same context, reference may also be made to the case of Chairman of NICL Ayaz Khan Niazi, who again was appointed without determining whether he is fit and proper person to hold the said post as a result whereof the government exchequer had to suffer an enormous loss, some of its portions have been recovered and still cases are pending before the Courts. This Court in Suo Moto Case No. 18 OF 2010 PLD 2011 SC 927 etc. 36 directed the Secretary Commerce to lodge complaint before FIA against the concerned persons for causing loss to the public exchequer. Similarly, the appointment of one Mr. Tauqir Sadiq as Chairman of the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority was challenged before this Court on the ground that he did not posses the necessary credentials for holding the said office. The Court in the case reported as Muhammad Yasin v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 2012 SC 132 , after considering the importance of the OGRA and scrutinizing the appointment process of its Chairman, declared his appointment void ab initio. There are other cases where some of the persons had succeeded in getting contract employments after their retirement in violation of section 14 of the Civil Servants Act, 1973 as well as instructions contained in ESTA Code. Reference may be made to Suo Motu Case No. 24 of 2010 PLD 2011 SC 277 wherein it was observed that in the disciplined forces, particularly, like police and FIA where people have to work in a well defined discipline, the persons supervising the forces were permitted to hold charge of the posts on contract basis. It may not be out of context to note that in terms of the definition of section 2 1 6 ii of the Civil Servants Act, 1973, a person who is employed on contract does not fall within the definition of a civil servant, so his authority to command and maintain discipline can be well imagined from the fact that if a person himself is not a civil servant, he is considered only bound by the terms and conditions of his contract and not by the statutory law, because if any condition laid down in the contract is violative of any statutory provision, he would only be etc. 37 subject to action under the said contract. In this view of the matter, the officers who were reemployed after retirement, were directed to be removed. In a recent case titled as Muhammad Ashraf Tiwana v. Pakistan Constitution Petition No.59 of 2011 , this Court found that the appointments of Chairman and Members of the Securities Exchange Commission of Pakistan did not meet the requirement of the Securities Exchange Commission of Pakistan Act, 1997 as such, the same too, were set aside. Last but not the least, this Court while hearing the case regarding implementation of directions issued in Suo Motu case No.16/2011 regarding law and order situation in Karachi, directed the Government of Sindh to terminate the services of 86 employees appointed in different grades from 12 to 21 on contract basis in various provincial departments. 25. During hearing of the case, it has been pointed out to petitioner Khawaja Muhammad Asif that although he being an elected Member of the Parliament had raised questions touching upon the transparency in the appointment of the heads of the autonomous, semi-autonomous bodies, corporations, regulatory authorities, etc., but in his own capacity as a public representative, he had also to ensure that all the appointments in such like bodies as well as the appointments on contract basis must be made in a transparent manner. In some of the countries, effective steps have been taken to stop such colossal loss of the national resources by day-to-day measures to improve the professional quality and political neutrality of appointments to public bodies/regulatory authorities by ensuring that selection in such bodies is based on merit, fairness and openness. It etc. 38 may not be out context to note that in UK, an independent Commissioner is available to regulate, monitor, report and advice the public appointments, the performances etc. All the government departments while making such appointments are bound to follow the code of practice which has been issued by such Commissioner. Similarly, in Canada all appointments for Chief Executives, Directors and Chairpersons of public sector corporations are subject to strict merit-based system. It may be noted that elected government has to heavily rely upon public bodies to implement their policies and the object essentially cannot be achieved if honest and competent persons are not holding such public offices. While making such appointments, following parameters are to be considered: - 1 Integrity: Holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside individuals or organizations that might seek to influence them in the performance of their official duties. 2 Objectivity: In carrying out public business, including making public appointments, awarding contracts, or recommending individuals for rewards and benefits, holders of public office should make choice solely on merit. 3 Accountability: Holders of public office are accountable for their decisions and actions to the public and must submit themselves to whatever scrutiny is appropriate to their office. 4 Openness: Holders of public office should be as open as possible about all the decisions and actions that they take. They should give reasons for their decisions and restrict information only when the wider public interest clearly demands. 5 Honesty: etc. 39 Holders of public office have a duty to declare any private interests relating to their public duties and to take steps to resolve any conflicts arising in a way that protects the public interest. 6 Leadership: Holders of public office should promote and support these principles by leadership and example. 26. Be that as it may, in order to ensure the enforcement of the fundamental right enshrined in Article 9 of the Constitution and considering it to be a question of public importance, a Commission headed by and comprising two other competent and independent members having impeccable integrity, may be the Federal Ombudsman or Chairman NAB or a Member of Civil Society having exceptional ability and integrity, is required to be constituted by the Federal Government through open merit based process having fixed tenure of four years to ensure appointments in statutory bodies, autonomous bodies, semi-autonomous bodies, regulatory authorities to ensure appointment of all the government controlled corporations, autonomous and semi-autonomous bodies, etc. The Commission should be mandated to ensure that all public appointments are made solely on merits. The Commission should discharge mainly the following functions: - i Regulate public appointments processes within his remit; ii implement a Code of Practice that sets out the principles and core processes for fair and transparent merit-based selections; iii chair the selection panels for appointing heads of public/statutory bodies and chairs and members of their boards, where necessary; iv appoint Public Appointments Assessors to chair the selection panels for appointing heads of public/statutory bodies and chairs and members of their boards, where appropriate; etc. 40 v report publicly on a public/statutory body s compliance with the Code of Practice, including examples of poor and good performance, and best practice; vi investigate complaints about unfair appointment process; vii Monitor compliance with the Code of Practice; viii Ensure regular audit of appointments processes within his remit; ix Issue an annual report giving detailed information about appointments processes, complaints handled, and highlights of the main issues which have arisen during the previous year. The annual report for the previous calendar year should be laid before the Parliament by 31 March; x Take any other measures deemed necessary for ensuring that processes for public sector appointments that fall in his remit are conducted honestly, justly, fairly and in accordance with law, and that corrupt practices are fully guarded against. 27. The Code of Practice should provide foundations for transparent merit-based public appointments. All public appointments must be governed by the overriding principle of selection based on merit, out of individuals who through abilities, experience and qualities have a proven record that they best match the need of the public body in question. No public appointment must take place without first being recommended by the Commission. The appointments procedures should be subjected to the principle of proportionality, that is, what is appropriate for the nature of the post and the size and weight of its responsibilities. Those, selected must be committed to the principles and values of public service and perform their duties with highest level of integrity. The information provided about the potential appointees must be made public. The Commission may from time to time conduct an inquiry into the policies and procedures followed by an appointing authority in relation to any appointment. He may also issue a statement or publish a report commenting publicly on any breach or anticipated breach of the Code. The appointment of the successful candidate must be publicized. etc. 41 28. In light of discussion made hereinabove, we hold that: - a The Caretaker Cabinet/Prime Minister appointed under Article 224 1 2 or 224A, as the case may be, is empowered to carry out only day-to-day affairs of the State with the help of the available machinery/resources/ manpower and also to watch national interest against war or national calamity or disaster faced by the nation, including terrorism, etc. b The civil servants who have already been appointed in accordance with the rules/regulations on the subject ought not to be posted/transferred, etc., except in extraordinary circumstances, that too, temporarily. c Major policy decisions including making of appointments, transfers and postings of the Government servants should be left to be made by the incoming government in view of the provisions of Constitution that the affairs of the State are to be run by the chosen representatives of the people. d As newly elected Government is mandated to perform its functions of achieving the object and purpose of welfare of the people for which it has been duly appointed, therefore, caretaker Cabinet/government/Prime Minister, having no mandate of public support, is only caretaker set up and due to this connotation should detach itself from making permanent policies having impact on future of the country. 29. As we have noted hereinabove that since the Caretaker Government after its appointment, had made more than 400 appointments, transfers and postings of Government servants/employees, including transfer on deputation with promotion to next higher grade or as the case may be, heads of autonomous, semi-autonomous bodies, regulatory authorities, heads of government controlled institution, etc., therefore, it may not be possible for this Court to discuss and deal with each and every case in these etc. 42 proceedings, therefore, their cases shall be subject to declaration, which is being made hereinbelow. 30. Thus, at the touchstone of the parameters laid down in the paras supra about the powers of the Caretaker Cabinet/Government, it is declared and held as under: - a The orders of appointment/deputation, transfers as well as postings, etc., of civil servants and Chief Executive Officers of statutory bodies, autonomous/ semi-autonomous bodies, corporations, regulatory authorities, etc., made by the Caretaker Cabinet/Prime Minister are hereby declared to be void, illegal and of no legal effect w.e.f. date of issuance of notifications respectively, except the transfers and appointments of senior government officers including the Chief Secretaries and IGP of any of the Provinces during the election process. i However, the Federal Government, in exercise of its powers would be authorized to allow to continue any of such appointments, transfers made by the Caretaker Cabinet/Government in the public interest, subject to following requisite provision of law. ii As far as the issue of notifications in the cases of i Mumtaz Khan CMA 3451/2013 , ii Muhammad Nadeem, AGM Marketing CMA 3480/2013 and iii General Syed Wajid Hussain, Chairman HIT Taxila are concerned, their notification of appointment shall remain frozen as process of their appointments had taken place before assumption of charge by Caretaker Cabinet/Government but their notifications were issued by the Caretaker Government. However, the Federal etc. b c 43 Government through competent authority shall decide fate of their cases within 15 days after receipt hereof and copy of decision shall be sent to Registrar for our perusal in Chambers. iii Needless to say that if there are identical cases as noted in para a ii , same shall be dealt with in the same manner. All the orders of removal or transfers as well as posting on deputation of civil servants and Chief Executive Officers of statutory bodies, autonomous/ semi-autonomous bodies, corporations, regulatory authorities, etc., by the Caretaker Cabinet/Prime Minister are hereby declared void, illegal and of no legal effect w.e.f. date of issuance of notifications respectively, however: i the Federal Government would be empowered to continue the removal or transfers, etc., of Chief Executive Officers/heads oof the departments, statutory bodies, autonomous/ semi-autonomous bodies, corporations, regulatory authorities, etc. in the public interest, subject to following requisite provision of law. As far as contract employees are concerned, whose contracts have been cancelled or those to whom fresh contracts of service have been given by the caretaker Cabinet/Government, shall stand cancelled as holders of contract employment of both these categories deserve no interference in view of the judgment of this Court in the case of State Life Insurance Employees Federation of Pakistan v. Federal Government of Pakistan 1994 SCMR 1341 , because no relief can be granted to them in these proceedings as no question of public importance with etc. d e f 44 reference to enforcement of their any of the fundamental rights arises; As far as the cases of the transfers of the civil servants/employees before the completion of tenure made allegedly in violation of the law laid down by this Court in Anita Turab case are concerned, the concerned departments of Federal Government shall examine their individual cases on the touchstone of the principles laid down in the said case. However, decision given on the complaint of any of the employees by this Court alleging violation of the principles enunciated in the judgment referred to hereinabove, shall be deemed to be in accordance with law. The appointments in autonomous/semi-autonomous bodies, corporations, regulatory authorities, etc., made before the appointment of Caretaker Government shall also be subjected to review by the elected Government by adopting the prescribed procedure to ensure that right persons are appointed on the right job, in view of the observations made in above paras Para. No. 25 26 ; and The Federal Government through the concerned Secretaries shall take up the issue of postings of 100 officers on deputation from Balochistan, as it was pointed out during the hearing of this case on 22.05.2013 and accomplish the same, if required, in accordance with law. 31. The Secretary Establishment is directed to communicate this judgment to all other Divisions, Ministries, Organizations, etc. for implementation of the same. 32. The case of the Ombudsman be de-linked and it shall be heard/decided separately in view of the question of interpretation of law on the subject namely, Establishment of the office of Wafaqi Mohtasib Ombudsman Order, 1983. etc. 45 33.

the available vacancies, or make proforma promotions of officials of all grades in autonomous and semi-autonomous bodies, corporations, regulatory authorities, statutory bodies, government controlled corporations, etc.", "It is to be seen that the Caretaker Cabinet/Prime Minister were installed in the Federation and Provinces in the month of March, 2013 after dissolution of the National and the Provincial Assemblies on completion of their respective terms provided under Article 224 1 1A of the Constitution, which read as under: - 224.", "1 A general election to the National Assembly or a Provincial Assembly shall be held within a period of sixty days immediately following the day on which the term of the Assembly is due to expire, unless the Assembly has been sooner dissolved, and the results of the election shall be declared not later than fourteen days before that day.", "1A On dissolution of the Assembly on completion of its term, or in case it is dissolved under Article 58 or Article 112, the President, or the Governor, as the case may be, shall appoint a caretaker Cabinet: etc.", "16 Provided that the care-taker Prime Minister shall be appointed by the President in consultation with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in the outgoing National Assembly, and a care-taker Chief Minister shall be appointed by the Governor in consultation with the Chief Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in the outgoing Provincial Assembly: Provided further that if the Prime Minister or a Chief Minister and their respective Leader of the Opposition do not agree on any person to be appointed as a care-taker Prime Minister or the care-taker Chief Minister, as the case may be, the provisions of Article 224A shall be followed : Provided also that the Members of the Federal and Provincial care-taker Cabinets shall be appointed on the advice of the care-taker Prime Minister or the care-taker Chief Minister, as the case may be.", "As in instant case the Caretaker Prime Minister could not be appointed in terms of Article 224 1A of the Constitution for want of consensus between the former elected Prime Minister and the Leader of the House, therefore, the provisions of Article 224A of the Constitution were invoked, and ultimately on account of inability of the Committee constituted under Article 224A 1 2 to decide the matter, the names of the nominees were referred to the Election Commission of Pakistan for finalizing the name of the caretaker Prime Minister within two days, thus, as a result of deliberations by the ECP, Caretaker Prime Minister was appointed in accordance with the provisions of Articles 224 1A and 224A 1 2 of the Constitution.", "Essentially, according to the settled and accepted norms/practice, the Caretaker Government Prime Minister and Cabinet is required to perform its functions to attend to the day-today matters, which are necessary to run the affairs of the State and also to watch the national interests, etc., in any eventuality in absence of an elected Government, and such Government is not authorized to etc.", "17 make decisions/appointments having effect on the working/policies of the future Government, which is likely to take over after the elections.", "Apart from providing assistance to the Election Commission in organizing free, fair, honest and just elections in the country, it is not vested with the authority to take decisions concerning the affairs of the Government, which are bound to pre-empt the scope and sphere of activity, powers and jurisdiction of an elected Government.", "A Caretaker Government possesses limited powers and authority particularly in view of the fact that when it is appointed, there is no National Assembly in place and thus the all important aspect of accountability is absent.", "Further, the exercise of complete powers by the Caretaker Government goes against the doctrine of separation of powers which is the lifeline of any vibrant democracy.", "As noted earlier, the absence of legislature results in lack of checks and balances.", "The Caretaker Government also lacks the mandate of the majority of people, which is to be acquired by elected government through the general elections.", "Therefore, if a Caretaker Government is allowed to exercise complete powers available to an elected Government, it may make an attempt to continue to remain in office for a longer period of time or may take such decisions which may cause problems for the future elected government.", "As per the scheme of the Constitution, prior to the 18 Constitutional Amendment, where the President dissolved the National Assembly under Article 48 5 , he shall, in his discretion, appoint caretaker Cabinet.", "Similarly, if the President, dissolves the National Assembly on the advice of the Prime Minister, he is required to put in place an interim set up or a temporary arrangement to ensure the etc.", "18 continuity of the functions of the Government to run day-to-day affairs of the State till the appointment of duly elected Government with its Cabinet after completion of the election process.", "Unfortunately, after the promulgation of the Constitution of 1973, during the Martial Law regime of General R Zia-ul-Haq in 1985, by means of the 8th Constitutional Amendment, an infamous provision, namely, Article 58 2 b was inserted into the Constitution, which provided that the President may dissolve the National Assembly in his discretion where, in his opinion, a situation has arisen in which the Government of the Federation cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and an appeal to the electorate is necessary.", "The said provision was later deleted by means of Thirteenth Constitutional Amendment in 1997.", "During the next Martial Law regime of General R Pervez Musharraf, the same was again inserted through the 17 Constitutional Amendment passed in 2003.", "However, after the restoration of democratic governance in the country, the new elected Government again deleted the said provision from the Constitution through the 18 Constitutional Amendment passed in 2010.", "It is to be noted that in exercise of the powers under the said provision, for more than one time, the National Assembly was dissolved and the elected Prime Minister/Cabinet were removed, and caretaker Prime Minister and Cabinet were appointed.", "The object and purpose of making reference to these provisions is to highlight that the functions of the elected Government have remained under serious threats.", "At the same time, it is also significant to point out that despite appointment of the Caretaker Prime Minister/Cabinet, no guidelines were ever provided laying down etc.", "19 the parameters to be observed by the Caretaker Governments in the exercise of their powers.", "As far as Constitution is concerned, Article 2A envisages that State shall exercise its powers and authority through the chosen representatives of the people and a comprehensive procedure, including qualifications and the disqualifications for the persons to be elected as Members of Majlis-e-Shoora Parliament has been prescribed.", "Thus, it is the chosen representatives of the people who have to run the affairs of the State for a fixed term of five years.", "Such representatives of the people are required to ensure good governance, lay down policies, and ensure betterment of the general public through legislative and executive actions.", "On the contrary, a Caretaker Government as compared to an elected Government remains in office for a very limited period whose first and last concern is to ensure that fair, free, honest and just elections are held in the country.", "The concept of caretaker or interim Government, in absence of an elected government is in vogue in a number of countries since the ancient times.", "Inasmuch as, in the Constitution of some of the countries, the concept of caretaker government does not specifically find a place, yet the practice of appointing caretaker government is in vogue those countries.", "Such countries include India, Australia, Canada, Bangladesh, Holland, New Zealand, UK, etc.", "With the passage of time, all those countries have developed Constitutional conventions, on the basis of which the caretaker governments are put in place to run the affairs of the State during the interim period, i.e.", "till returning to power of the duly elected governments having full powers and such caretaker governments do not, in general, take any major policy decisions, including making appointments of civil servants, etc., etc.", "20 particularly in the manner it has been done by the Caretaker Government that had come into existence on completion of the term of the previous Government.", "At this stage, reference may be made to the Constitutional system of Australia.", "As per the scheme of the Australian Constitution, the caretaker government is expected to conduct itself in accordance with a series of conventions administered by the department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, although there is no law compelling the caretaker government to do so.", "Usually, there is no separate appointment of a caretaker government and the outgoing government continues to function as caretaker government.", "During the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, the then Governor-General appointed a new government with the assurance that it would immediately advise a general election, and it would operate on a caretaker basis in the meantime.", "The political system of Australia ensures that a Cabinet is always maintained and that caretaker governments abide by the conventions.", "Any flouting of the conventions by a caretaker government would immediately come to light, and could go against them in the election campaign.", "In this regard, a document titled Guidance on Caretaker Conventions has been administered by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.", "Section 1.2 of the Caretaker Conventions provides that a caretaker government operates until the election result clearly indicates that either the incumbent party has retained power, or in the case where there is to be a change of government, until the new government is appointed by the Governor-General.", "The relevant clauses of the guidelines are reproduced hereinbelow: - etc.", "SIGNIFICANT APPOINTMENTS 3.1 Governments defer making significant appointments during the caretaker period.", "When considering the advice it would give on whether an appointment qualifies as significant , the agency should consider not only the importance of the position, but also whether the proposed appointment would be likely to be controversial.", "3.2 If deferring the appointment is impracticable, usually for reasons associated with the proper functioning of an agency, there are several options: the Minister could make an acting appointment where permissible; the Minister could make a short term appointment until shortly after the end of the caretaker period; or if those options are not practicable, the Minister could consult the relevant Opposition spokesperson regarding a full term appointment.", "In Canada too, Guidelines on the Conduct of Ministers, Secretaries of State, Exempt Staff and Public Servants during an Election have been issued which provide, inter alia, as under: - GUIDELINES ON THE CONDUCT OF MINISTERS, SECRETARIES OF STATE, EXEMPT STAFF AND PUBLIC SERVANTS DURING AND ELECTION This does not mean that government is absolutely barred from making decisions of announcements, or otherwise taking action, during an election.", "It can and should do so where the matter is routine and necessary for the conduct of government business, or where it is urgent and in the public interest - for example, responding to a natural disaster.", "In certain cases where a major decision is unavoidable during a campaign e.g., due to an international obligation or an emergency , consultation with the Opposition may be appropriate, particularly where a major decision could be controversial or difficult for a new government to reverse.", "Contracts, G Cs and Appointment Appointments should normally be deferred.", "The Prime Minister s Office must be consulted before making any commitments concerning appointments that cannot be deferred.", "etc. 22 As far as UK is concerned, they have also issued similar guidelines in 2010.", "Relevant guidelines are reproduced hereinbelow: - SECTION G Government Decisions 1.", "During an election campaign the Government retains its responsibility to govern and Ministers remain in charge of their Departments.", "Essential business must be carried on.", "In particular Cabinet Committees can continue to meet and consider correspondence if necessary, although in practice this may not be practical.", "If something requires urgent collective consideration, the Cabinet Secretariat should be consulted.", "However, it is customary for Ministers to observe discretion in initiating any new action of a continuing or long-term character.", "Decisions on matters of policy, and other issues such as large and/or contentious procurement contracts, on which a new Government might be expected to want the opportunity to take a different view from the present Government should be postponed until after the Election, provided that such postponement would not be detrimental to the national interest or wasteful of public money.", "SECTION H Public and Senior Civil Service Appointments 1.", "All appointments requiring approval by the Prime Minister, other Civil Service and public appointments likely to prove sensitive, including those where Ministers have delegated decisions to officials or other authorities, such as appointments to certain NHS boards , should effectively be frozen until after the Election.", "This applies to appointments where a candidate has already accepted a written offer.", "The individual concerned should be told that the appointment will be subject to confirmation by the new Administration after the Election.", "It is recognised that, should this procedure result in the cancellation or substantial delay of an appointment by the new Administration, the relevant Department could be vulnerable to legal action by a disappointed candidate who had already accepted a written offer.", "To reduce the risk of this happening, Departments might wish to: recommend to their Secretary of State the advisability either of delaying key stages in the process, or of consulting the Opposition e.g.", "on a short-list of candidates or a single name for final selection where an appointment is likely to take effect just before or after an election; etc.", "23 issue a conditional letter of offer, making it clear that the formal offer of the appointment will need to be confirmed by a new Administration.", "In cases where an appointment is due to end between the announcement of the Election and Election Day, and no announcement has been made concerning the new appointment, it will normally be possible for the post to be left vacant until incoming Ministers have been able to take a decision either about re-appointment of the existing appointee or the appointment of a new person.", "This situation is also likely to apply to any appointments made by Letters Patent, or otherwise requiring Royal approval, since it would not be appropriate to invite Her Majesty to make a conditional appointment.", "In the case of public and Senior Civil Service appointments, Departments should delay the launch of any open competition during an election period, to give any incoming Administration the option of deciding whether to follow the existing approach.", "In those cases where an appointment is required to be made, it is acceptable, in the case of sensitive Senior Civil Service positions, to allow temporary promotion or substitution.", "In the case of public appointments, the current term may be extended to cover the Election period, or as required, with the prior approval of the Commissioner for Public Appointments.", "This will allow time for new Ministers to take a decision about longer term appointment.", "In any cases of doubt, and particularly where circumstances make it difficult to apply these temporary arrangements, Departments should consult the Propriety and Ethics Team in the Cabinet Office.", "The Cabinet Manual: A guide to laws, conventions and rules on the operation of government, 1 edition, October 2011 provides, inter alia, as under: - PARLIAMENT 7.", "Parliament has a number of functions, which include: controlling national expenditure and taxation; making law; scrutinising executive action; being the source from which the Government is drawn; and debating the issues of the day.", "All areas of the UK are represented in the House of Commons, which provides a forum for Members of Parliament MPs to speak and correspond on behalf of their constituents, where they can seek redress if necessary.",

Inasmuch as Mr. Imtiaz\nKazi is concerned, he stated that he has not attended the oath taking\nceremony of Ombudsman held on 01.03.2013 in the Presidency.

The contentious issues on which the parties are at odds are:-\n\nThe quantum of energy needed during peak demand. Ministry f Water and Power\nplaces this figure at 17,211 MW (thus shortage of 6,728 MW) but these figures are\ndisputed by APTMA. The Ministry of Water and Power basis its figures on the\ngeneration figures of 2006 when there was no load shedding while APTMA contends\nthat the peak demand is currently the same as it was in January 2013 when there was\nless load shedding (About 4 hours only).\n\nFigures of the connected load of the various DISCOs as provided by Ministry of Water\nand Power are contested by APTMA.\n\nThat the participants linked the equitable distribution to a number of factors, such as,\nwhether or not the consumers are paying their electricity bills, the prevailing weather\nconditions, the levels of discomfort, the nature of the industrial process, the supply or\nnon-supply of gas, the effect on employment and binding contracts, whether export\norders are involved, etc. There was no consensus as to which factors should have\npriority in terms of the equitable distribution of electricity. Therefore, the distribution\nformula needs to be continuously reviewed and appropriate adjustments need to be\nmade.\n\nThe Ministry of Water and Power maintains that if the regional representatives of\nAPTMA (Industry operating in particular areas) approach the DISCO that supplies them\nelectricity, it may be possible to obtain some more relief against load shedding with in\nthe parameters of the supply allocated to that DISCO”\n\n2. It is informed by Mr. Zargham Eshaq, MD NTDC that as per data\n\ncollected from different generating companies 12891 MW electricity is likely to\n\nbe produced during course of the day.\n\nRequirement/ | Actual Percentage\nSupply of supply\nDemand\n\n1200 MW 701 MW 58.4%\n\nKPK 2700 MW 1870 MW_ | 69.3%\nPunjab 12080 MW 7714 MW__[ 63.9%\n2200 MW 1403 MW_ | 63.8%\n\nIslamabad 1600 MW 1080 MW 67.5%\nAJK 400 MW 295 MW 73.7%\n\n3. Mr. Salman Akram Raja, learned counsel for APTMA and two\ncement plants, namely, (i) Maple-Leaf and (ii) Pioneer Cement stated that the\nexpression used by this Court i.e. ‘equitable supply of electricity’ has been\nmisinterpreted by the DISCOs as a result whereof number of industries have\nbeen put to close for want of electricity. On behalf of M/s. Flying Cement\nCompany it has also been informed by Mr. Kamran Khan, M.D. that their plant\nwas closed down w.e.f. 1.6.2013 to onward by the concerned DISCO (FESCO),\nhowever, during the meeting with the learned Attorney General for Pakistan it\nhas been decided that the Cement Industry must be supplied electricity\nminimum for a period of four hours continuously. Learned Attorney General\nexplained that it was agreed by the owners of the Cement Industry that they\nwould share the load shedding of electricity but on account of nature of the\nindustry at least they should be given supply of four hours continuously so\nthat the kiln may continuously operate at least for this much period because if\nthere is a gap in supply of electricity, kiln may not operate. M.D. NTDC also\nstated that arrangements have to be made in view of the agreement between\nthe parties before the learned Attorney General with the DISCOs. We direct to\n\nall the industrialists including the owners of the cement plants to have a\n\ndiscussion with the respective DISCOs and find out a solution in the manner\nso they get electricity at least for a period during which one of their kiln\noperates.\n\n4. CMA Nos. 3402 & 3975/2013 have also been filed on behalf of the\nPresident of the District Bar Associations Mirpur, Azad Kashmir. Notice of the\nsame be issued to PEPCO and NTDC for filing reply.\n\n5. It has been informed by Mr. Nauman Wazir that there are so many\ndefaulters, particularly ordinary consumers in different areas who are getting\nthe electricity without making the payment and at the same time the persons\nwho make the payment, on account of conduct of the former they have also to\nsuffer because if the charges are not paid it would not be possible for the\nGENCOs etc. to generate electricity.\n\n6. We have suggested that let the Attorney General seek instructions\nfrom the Federal Government as well as the Provincial Governments that the\nprovinces should start purchasing electricity in bulk and amount of the same\nshall be paid or deducted by the Federal Government from their NFC Award\nshare and as far as the Provincial Governments are concerned, they being the\nIn-charge to maintain law and order, shall effect the recoveries from the\nconsumers, may be the industrialists or ordinary, so the supply of electricity is\nsupplied smoothly to the persons, who are ready to make the payment of the\ncharges. On this learned Attorney General stated that to examine this\n\npropositions he needs some time.\n\n7. It has also been informed by Mr. Nauman Wazir that there are so\nmany licence holders/lease holders who have been allowed to generate hydel\nelectricity in the Northern Areas but instead of using those sites by raising the\ncivil works and bringing the machinery, they have kept the license with them\nfor the purpose of further doing the business by selling the same at the higher\nrates and whenever objection is raised by the KPK Government they approach\nthe Courts and get stay orders. He states that if this aspect of the case is\nexamined and the production of the hydel electricity is encouraged, it would be\nquite convenient to overcome the difficulties because the industrialists would\nbe in a position to utilise this electricity by making the payment of wheeling\ncharges.\n\nThe Chief Secretary of the KPK is directed to collect the information from\nall concerned and put up a list, before the next date of hearing. He would also\ncollect information in respect of litigation, if any, its nature and stage of\nlitigation.\n\n8. The MD PEPCO is required to collect the list from PPIB and AEDB\nof the licence holders who have not installed the projects despite issuing of\nlicences. He would also procure information as to why the plants have not\nbeen installed so far. Meanwhile notices to both the Organizations, named\nhereinabove, may be issued.\n\n9. MD, NTDC stated that within next two weeks two plants Liberty\nand HUBCO, Narowal are likely to come into production of electricity as a sum\n\nof Rs.33 billion is required to be paid to them.\n\n10. Let NTDC and DISCOs continue for negotiations with the\nindustrialists etc. as has been noted hereinabove and supply of electricity shall\nbe made on the formula of equitable distribution to industries and other\nconsumers of electricity.\n\n11. Mr. Nauman Wazir also pointed out that instead of using furnace\noil which is costly, it is suggested that for the thermal Coal-water slurry fuel be\nused. MD, PEPCO and NTDC may examine this aspect of the case as well.\n\nAdjourned to 26th June, 2013.\n\nChief Justice\nJudge\nJudge\nIslamabad\n19.6.2013\n\n(Zulfiqar)", "CleanedText": "ORDER In pursuance of earlier order learned Attorney General for Pakistan has submitted a comprehensive report CMA No.3863/2013 .

He stated that he assumed the charge\n\nas Secretary, Overseas and Human Resources on 03.05.2013, whereas,\n\nConst.P.No.35 of 2013 -2-\n\nearlier to his appointment, Mr. Ahsan Raja performed duties as\nSecretary of said Division from 27.05.2011 to 03.05.2013. According\nto him, presently, there is no Chairman of EOBI as on the transfer of\nformer Chairman, Mr. Zafar Iqbal Gondal, he approached the Sindh\nHigh Court and succeeded in obtaining stay order dated 8.5.2013,\ncontents whereof indicates that latter was restrained to be repatriated\nto his parent department, however, he was also restrained from acting\nas Chairman, EOBI till the next date of hearing. He further stated that\nin the meanwhile, he (Mr. Zafar Iqbal Gondal), on 31.5.2013 had\nrelinquished the charge on his own and reportedly had joined his\noriginal department, namely, Pakistan Audit and Accounts Service,\ntherefore, no Chairman could be appointed. When we enquired from\nhim as to whether information disseminated by Mr. Huzaifa Rehman,\non a private channel of electronic media, extract whereof has also been\nmade available along with the report published in print media, the\nsame was based on correct facts or otherwise, he stated that the\ninformation so disclosed was correct except that certain chains were\nmissing, therefore, as he was not in possession of complete record.\n\n2. Mr. Huzaifa Rehman has also appeared and confirmed the\nfacts which have been noted in the office note and stated that he is not\nin possession of certain documents which he could produce in Court.\nHe was allowed to do so but after some time he appeared and stated\nthat as he is receiving threats on phone calls and in the meanwhile he\nhas to go to Lahore to appear in viva voce examination, as such, on\n\ncoming back from Lahore he would produce those documents before\n\nConst.P.No.35 of 2013 -3-\n\nthe Court. Be that as it may, as the Secretary being the custodian of\noriginal record, has not contradicted his story, therefore, he is\npermitted to go to Lahore and in the meanwhile, Secretary Interior,\nGovernment of Pakistan, is directed to provide him protection. In\nresponse, Additional Secretary Interior, present in court, stated that\nfull protection would be provided to him and it would be ensured that\nno one could cause harm to his person and property.\n\n3. According to the report submitted by the Secretary,\nimmediately after joining the department, he has issued directions for\nban on purchase of property and award of new construction contracts\nw.e.f. 7.5.2013. Perusal of the report suggests that regarding alleged\ncorruption in EOBI in the 106 BoT meeting held on 11.6.2013 one of\nthe actions is reproduced herein below:\n\n“4, An Audit Party headed by Chief Finance and\nAccount Officer of the Ministry of Overseas\nPakistanis and Human Resource Development has\nbeen constituted to probe issues related to\nInvestments in he EOBI with the direction to submit\nits report by 6\" July, 2013.”\n\n4. It is important to note that in the information disclosed in\nthe electronic media, reference of which has been made hereinabove,\npurchasing of property by EOBI on alleged exorbitant rates, have been\nhighlighted. In this regard, the Secretary HR & Overseas has placed on\nrecord a list of 18 properties purchased privately by EOBI including\nproperty from the DHA, Islamabad and Rawalpindi; and most of the\ntransactions, prima facie, seem to have taken place in a non-\n\ntransparent manner, including non-following PEPRA Rules.\n\nConst.P.No.35 of 2013 -4-\n\n5.

He has specifically referred\nto clause 4.12 ibid. It is his case that according to the terms and\nconditions of the said agreement, cost of development and marketing\nof the plots is the responsibility of Behria Town, therefore, he is of the\nopinion that in such manner DHA will not be benefited, but, in the\nmeanwhile, this very property has been purchased by the EOBI for the\n\namount mentioned hereinabove, details of the cheques has also been\n\n\nConst.P.No.35 of 2013 -5-\n\nplaced on record with the report by the Secretary which reads as\n\nunder:-\n\n“DHA - Islamabad\n\nSubject:- Payment on account of purchase of properties amounting to Rs.15,743,700,000/-\nfrom M/s DHA Islamabad in Phase | & II Extensions-DHA Express way and DHA Valley-\nmeasuring 321.3 Kanals.\n\nSr.# Description Cheque# Dated Amount Paid Favoring\n\n1.

He further stated that he raised objection on\nthis agreement because it was not in the benefit of DHA, inasmuch as,\nhe brought the said facts in the notice of the then Adjutant General, Lt.\nGeneral (R) Javed Iqbal, but instead of considering his objection he was\nremoved from the job. He further stated that he has received threats\n\nfrom one Nawaz Khokhar and others and has written a letter on\n\n\nConst.P.No.35 of 2013 -6-\n\n08.12.2011 to Malik Riaz Hussain, copy of which has been placed on\nrecord.\n\n7.

We had issued notice for the attendance of Mr. Zafar Iqbal\nGondal, former Chairman, EOBI but he has not appeared. At this stage\n\nDG FIA has appeared and filed a report (CMA No.4212/2013), contents\n\n\nConst.P.No.35 of 2013\n\nof Paras No. 1, 2, 7, 13, 14 & 18 of the same are reproduced\n\nhereinbelow:\n\n\"1,\n\n13.\n\nEnquiry No.30/2011 of F.LA. C.B.C, Karachi was registered on\n30.05.2013 after verification of a pseudonymous complaint received\nin FIA CBC, Karachi alleging massive corruption in EOBI, especially\nin property investment.\n\nAfter completion of the enquiry, Case FIR No.11/2013 of FIA CBC,\nKarachi dated 24.06.2013 has been registered u/s 409, 419, 468,\n471, 109 of PPC r/w Section 5(2) of Prevention of Corruption Act\n1947 against the Management of employees Old-Age Benefits\nInstitution (EOBI), private property owners and others regarding\npurchase of four acres highly disputed land bearing Naclas 153,\nSurvey No.536 & 537 of Deh Mehran, Tapo Malir, Karachi by EOBI at\na very exorbitant rate excessively disproportionate to the then\nexisting market rates. The land was not even in possession of the\nseller, and there were/are a number of claimants of the said piece of\nland. Besides, the land had no access/approach. The property was\npurchased by EOBI for Pak Rupees 2.023 billions out of which\nreportedly approximately 50% (1.00billion) were received back as\nkickback under a_ pre-settled/agreed arrangement. Thus\nEOBI/government sustained a approximate loss of 2.25 billions\n(including stamp duties/fees etc.) as a result of this shady, collusive,\nmaneuvered and manipulated deal.\n\nAccording to Mr. Muhammad Qasim Pervez, authorized\nrepresentative of Mst. Nighat Asad Mirza and Maham Mirza, the\nabove advertisement was just a formality and it was already agreed\nthat EOBI would purchase only the land in question. Therefore,\ninstead of submitted bid/application through given P.O. box No.30\nKarachi, the bid/application of Rs. 165,000/- (Rupees One lac and\nsixty five thousand only_ per square yard for sale of 04 acres lands\nwas submitted at the reception of EOBI. Subsequently, on the\ninstructions of Mr. Wahid Khursheed Kunwar, DG Investment EOBI, a\nvisit of the land by a team of valuators M/s. AAA/Colliers Pakistan\nInternational (Pvt) Ltd. was arranged.\n\nThus it is an established fact that an amount of Rs.809.248 million\nwas paid at a time when the title of the land in question was not\nclear. A total sum of Rs.2.023 billion were disbursed to the sellers\nfrom the government Exchequer which ultimately reached the\naccounts of the lady sellers. The sellers subsequently returned 50%\n\nof sale proceeds approx Rs.1 billion as kickback to the accused Zafar\n\nConst.P.No.35 of 2013 -8-\n\nIqbal Gondal and Wahid Kursheed Kunwar being pre-settled deal\nthrough different means mainly through one Shaikh Farrukh Saleem,\na clearing agent and close friend of accused Wahid Khursheed\nKunwar.\n\n14. Shaikh Farrukh Saleem during investigation voluntarily disclosed\nthat he received an amount of Rs.710 Million from the sellers\nthrough cash cheques and cross cheques. He further disclosed that\nhe deposited an amount of Rs.650 Million in his account maintained\nat Standard Chartered Bank Clifton Branch, Karachi and\nsubsequently handed over the entire amount in cash to Wahid\nKhurshid Kanwar and Zafar Iqbal Gondal directly or through their\nnominated persons.\n\n16. From the facts narrated above, it is established that accused (1)\nZafar Iqbal gondal as chairman (2) Wahid Khursheed Kunwar as DG\n9Investment) EOBI and as such public servants, were entrusted with\nEOBI funds, both while discharging their official duties, in complicity\nwith (3) Muhammad Iqbal Dawood (employers’ Representative\nSindh) (4) Malik Imtiaz Mehmood (Employees’ Representative\nBalochistan) and lady accused (5) Mst. Nighat Mirza w.o Col. (R) Ali\nAsad Mirza (6) Mst. Maham Najeeb d/o Col. (R)Ali Asad Mirza (7)\nMuhammad Qasim Pervaiz (representative of both the ladies) (8)\ncol. (R) ali Asad Mirza and others have committed criminal breach of\ntrust in respect of such funds and thus caused wrongful loss to the\nGovernment exchequer to the tune of approximately Rs. 2.25 billion\nand corresponding wrongful gain for themselves and other\n\nassociates.”\n\nLikewise, in respect of some of the other transactions reference has\nbeen made in the report of Secretary. Be that as it may, we enquired\nfrom the Secretary HR & Overseas as to why immediate steps were not\ntaken to save the wealth of public exchequer after having taken over\nthe charge, he stated that a case has already been registered reference\nof which has been given hereinabove, and according to the DG FIA\nthree persons, namely, M/s. Wahid Khursheed Kunwar, (DG\nInvestment), Mst. Maham Najeeb and Ali Asad Mirza have been\n\narrested; whereas Mr. Qasim Pervaiz has obtained transitory bail on\n\nConst.P.No.35 of 2013 -9-\n\n5th June, 2013 from the Islamabad High Court and Mr. Iqbal Daood has\nobtained transitory bail on 6 June, 3013 from the Sindh High Court,\nHyderabad Bench and the dates of their bails are likely to expire on 5\nand 6\" July, 2013, respectively. Registrar shall procure the copy of the\norders of granting bail to both of them from the concerned courts and\nsubmit for our perusal.\n\n8. In view of the above narration of facts and having gone\nthrough the reports submitted by the Secretary HR as well as the DG\nFIA, it is directed that:\n\n1) The Director General FIA shall proceed forthwith to\nconduct inquiry/investigation, as the case may be, in all\nthe cases pertaining to the alleged corruption in making\ninvestment in the properties which are 18 in number as\nper list supplied by the Secretary along with his report.\n\n2) DG, FIA would also be free to further probe into the affair\nin respect of any transaction of EOBI wherein it is noticed\nthat corruption or corrupt practices have been committed\nby the responsible persons, whosoever he may be and\nwithout being influenced in any manner from their rank,\nstatus or position, political or otherwise because the\nmoney, against which it is alleged that misappropriation\nhas been committed by corruption and corrupt practices,\n\nbelong\n\nConst.P.No.35 of 2013 -10-\n\nbeneficiaries of EOBI are entitled for the protection of their\nFundamental Rights.\n\n3) Secretary Interior shall strengthen the DG FIA by allowing\nhim the services of the officers/officials from within or\noutside the cadre of FIA, in accordance with rules because\nwe feel that allegations which have been unearthed called\nfor, serious efforts to collect evidence immediately instead\n\nof allowing to spoil the same.\n\n9.

He is\ndirected to handover a copy of the same to the learned Attorney\nGeneral for Pakistan and all other stakeholders, as they all are\nentitled to consume electricity, as per the formula of “equitable\ndistribution” of the available electricity. According to the record\nmaintained by the PEPCO, on June 30% 2013, total generation\nhas been shown to be 13,392 MW. In this chart, total generation\nof electricity of KESC, Kanup, Captive Power Plants throughout in\nthe country and IPPs operating in Karachi, along with the\nconsumption load has not been shown except that KESC export\n650 MW from NTDC.\n2. Similarly, we are also required to know about the\ndetails of all the IPPs operating on Gas or RFO in the country\nalong with the details of their electricity generating capacity and\nif there is a shortfall reasons for the same along with the\nprocedure required to be followed by PEPCO, NTDC, NEPRA or\nany other regulatory authority to pursue them to achieve\nmaximum target of generation of electricity as payments of their\n\nbills are causing extra load on the public exchequer and despite\n\nHRC No.14392 of 2013 & HRC No.790-G of 2009 -3-\n\nof it they are not getting electricity. However, in the meanwhile\nSecretary WAPDA may arrange their forensic audit so we have full\npicture about their performance and financial liability on the\npublic exchequer from the date of their commissioning upto date.\n3. On having gone through the data, which has been\nsupplied and during the discussion with the Managing Director,\nPEPCO, prima facie, we are of the opinion that subject to\nimprovements in the management it is not difficult to achieve the\ntarget of generating electricity required to be consumed all over\nthe country because we also note that there are Wind and Solar\nProjects for generating electricity, therefore, approximate figures\nof generating electricity from such sources be also collected.\n\n4. The learned counsel for the DISCOs stated that 300\nMW is being supplied to KESC from the Punjab, but this\nstatement has been contradicted by the Managing Director, as\naccording to him it is not possible to slash from the quota of the\nprovinces because such supply to KESC is being made from the\nNational Grid.\n\nIn such view of the matter, we direct that notice be issued\nto the Chief Executive, KESC to appear and explain about the\ngenerating capacity and supplies from all resources including IPPs\nby the KESC and as to whether the company is self sufficient to\ncater the requirements, if electricity is generated to its maximum\n\ncapacity.\n\nHRC No.14392 of 2013 & HRC No.790-G of 2009 -4-\n\n5. On the last date of hearing we have observed that the\nprovincial governments should take responsibility to control\npilferage, leakage and theft of electricity so the persons who are\nlaw abiding and consuming electricity against payments should\nnot be penalized for the sake of those who are committing theft\netc. Suggestions in this behalf were put forward that in such like\nsituation let the provincial governments agree to receive bulk\nsupply proportionately for the purpose of consumption of all\ncategories including domestic and commercial etc.\n\n6. We have also noticed that the uncounted for natural\ngas, as it has been pointed out by Mr. Muhammad Ashraf, GM\n(Sales) is about 10% which also varies with the input and out of\nthe same about 5% of natural gas is uncounted because of theft\netc. When we enquired from the representative of the SNGPL\nthat whether against the total supply of gas to consumers of all\ncategories 100% sale proceeds are recovered. He stated that\nthere is always a shortfall of 10%. In such view of the matter\nagain we are of the opinion that unless following the principle of\nequitable supply of the gas and also ensuring that the uncounted\nfor gas is not reduced and theft of the gas is not fully\ncontrolled/checked, the gas company shall not be in a position to\nsupply the gas to the IPPs, GENCOs etc., as per their\n\nrequirements. Besides it, public exchequer has to suffer huge\n\nHRC No.14392 of 2013 & HRC No.790-G of 2009 -5-\n\nlosses because of mismanagement, which occurs on account of\nthe reasons noted herein before.\n\nThus both the companies i.e. SNGPL and SSGC through their\n\nManaging Directors are required to put up complete details of the\nsupply of the gas as has been pointed out hereinbefore including\nthe gas which is supplied to the Captive Power Plants vis-a-vis\naccurate figure of purchasing electricity against the same by the\nNTDC, as it has been pointed out by Mr. Zargham Eshaq, MD,\nPEPCO.\n7.

Application has been filed on behalf of the respondent\nFederation through Secretary, Ministry of Defence, Government of\nPakistan for seeking extension of time in the holding of\nCantonment Elections in respect whereof, this Court, vide\njudgment dated 03.01.2013 had directed to complete the process\nof elections up to 05.05.2013.\n\n2. Brief facts of the case are that the petitioner\napproached this Court by filing a petition under Article 184(3) of\nthe Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, inter alia, with\n\nthe following prayer: -\n\nCMA No.3258/2013 2\n\n“It is, therefore, respectfully prayed that keeping in\nview the above submissions, the respondent No.1\nmay kindly be directed to issue Notification for the\npurpose of de-limitation of the wards in Cantonments\nand further be directed to prepare electoral roll of the\nwards in Cantonment and further be directed to hold\nelection of the Cantonment Board forthwith in\n\naccordance with law.”\n\nThe petitioner’s case was that under Article 32 read with Article\n140A of the Constitution, it is incumbent upon the State to\nencourage Local Government Institutions comprising elected\nrepresentatives of the area concerned with special representation\nof peasants, workers and women. It was not disputed that the\nelections to the Cantonment Boards, as required under section\n14(1)(b) of the Cantonment Act, 1924 [Act, 1924] were not\nconducted for about last 14 year on one pretext or the other.\n\n3. During hearing of the matter, it was stated on behalf\nof the respondent Federation that in pursuance of provisions of\nsection 14(1)(b) of Act, 1924, a summary had been moved to the\nChief Executive/Prime Minister of Pakistan on 05.05.2012 with the\nproposal that it was necessary to vary the composition of 31\nCantonment Boards for a period of one year commencing from\n05.05.2012, which was about to expire on 04.05.2013. It was\nalso stated that as soon as approval was accorded by the Prime\nMinister allowing the Election Commission of Pakistan to hold\nelections to the Cantonment Boards, necessary administrative\narrangements would be made in that behalf. Furthermore, by\nmeans of CMA No.5232/2012 it was, inter alia, stated that in\ncompliance of order of the Apex Court dated 17.12.2012, it is\n\nsubmitted that this Ministry has no intention to seek further\n\nCMA No.3258/2013 3\n\nextension (which is still 04.05.2013), in the existing Boards\nsought earlier vide section 14(1) of Cantonment Act, 1924. This\nCourt vide order dated 03.01.2013 disposed of the petition with\nthe direction that the Federal Government may not allow further\nextension in variation of composition of Cantonment Boards in\nterms of section 14(1)(b) of the Act, 1924 after 05.05.2013\nunless conditions noted therein were required to be pressed into\nservice compulsorily and in the meanwhile steps would be taken\nto ensure that the elections of Cantonment Boards were held after\ncompleting the process of the limitations of wards, etc., as per the\nCantonment Ordinance, 2002 read with the Cantonments Local\nGovernment (Elections) Rule, 2012 as the Election Commission\nwas also willing and ready to under the process of election.\n\n4. By this Misc. Application for extension of time in the\nholding of Cantonment Boards Elections is being sought, inter\nalia, stating therein that a request for holding elections for the\nlocal government in the Cantonment areas was sent to the ECP\nvide letter dated 21.12.2012, but the ECP vide its letter dated\n18.03.2013 raised certain legal questions/observations and advice\nof Law & Justice Division was sought thereon. It is stated that\npending the clarification of the said legal issues and the fact that\nthe ECP was busy in holding general elections in the country, it\nwas not possible to hold the Cantonment Boards elections by the\ntarget date fixed by this Court.\n\n5. A written statement signed by the Secretary, Ministry\nof Defence was filed in Court, wherein he had requested for\nextension of time for holding of elections of the Cantonment\n\nBoards and undertaken that the entire process of elections in all\n\nCMA No.3258/2013 4\n\nthe Cantonment Boards would be completed on or before\n15.09.2013.\n\n6. Learned Attorney General appeared and explained\nthat the Government is contemplating essential amendments in\nthe relevant laws for the purpose of holding Cantonment Boards\nelections and since the process is likely to consume some time,\ntherefore, extension of time in holding the elections be allowed.\n\n7. It may be observed that prior to the Partition of the\nSubcontinent, the territory of Indo-Pak remained under the\nforeign domination for a long period, during which its traditional\ninstitutions were badly mutilated if they escaped extinction. The\nvast majority of people in the country lived in villages and small\ntowns; therefore, it was required to evolve a system that would\nincreasingly associate them with the ordering of their affairs. This\ncould only be achieved through decentralization of the authority\nwhich had been vested in the District Officer under the British\nrule. In that scenario, a system was required to be evolved which\nhas its roots in the public and after building a strong base goes on\nto construct the structure above. It had to be different from the\nsystem which had beautifully trimmed structure with all the frills\nof parliamentary democracy but hollow from within and without\nany base below. For a real democracy, it is necessary that all the\ninhabitants must have a say in their affairs. With the prevailing\nlevel of political consciousness, they can fully understand their\nimmediate problems and requirements and evaluate what is of\nimmediate good and what is not. There is little reason, therefore,\nwhy advantage of this should not be taken by involving them in\n\nthe management of their affairs through directly chosen\n\nCMA No.3258/2013 5\n\nrepresentatives. For a villager it is, perhaps, not possible to\nassess with any degree of accuracy the qualities and disabilities of\nrival candidates from distant cities who may make periodic\nappearances at the time of elections, but he is surely a good\njudge of a fellow villager who may canvass for his vote for a local\ncouncil.\n8. After long time a solution was provided in the year\n1979 in the shape of respective Local Government Ordinances for\neach province. The procedure for conduct of election of the Local\nGovernment was provided. However, by means of respective\nLocal Government Elections Ordinance, 2000, new mechanism\nwas provided for conducting the elections. Later, the local\ngovernment laws were repealed through fresh Local Government\nOrdinance, 2001.

It may be observed that initially, the Cantonment Act,\n1924 was promulgated to consolidate and amend the law relating to\nthe administration of cantonments. Later on, the said Act was\nsuperseded by the Cantonment Ordinance, 2002. As per definition of\nCantonment provided in section 3 of the Ordinance, 2002, the\nGovernment may, by notification in the official Gazette, declare any\nplace or places in which any part of the armed forces of Pakistan is\nquartered or where defence installation or defence production units\nare located or which, being in the vicinity of any such place or places,\nis or are required for the service of such forces to be a cantonment\nfor the purposes of the Ordinance and of all other enactments for the\ntime being in force, and may, by a like notification, declare that any\ncantonment shall cease to be a cantonment. The Government may,\nby a like notification, define the limits of any cantonment for the\naforesaid purposes. When any place is declared a cantonment for the\nfirst time, the Government may, until a local government is\nconstituted in accordance with the provisions of the Ordinance, by\norder make any provision which appears necessary to it either for the\nadministration of the Cantonment or for the constitution of the local\ngovernment. The Government may, by notification in the official\nGazette, direct that in any place declared a cantonment under sub-\nsection (1) the provisions of any enactment relating to local\ngovernment other than the Ordinance shall have effect only to such\nextent or subject to such modifications, or that any authority\n\nconstituted under any such enactment shall exercise authority\n\nCMA No.3258/2013 8\n\nonly to such extent, as may be specified in the notification. Section\n57 of the Ordinance provides that members of union councils,\nincluding union Nazims and Naib Union Nazims, shall be elected\nthrough elections based on adult franchise and on the basis of a joint\nelectorate. The Electoral College for elections of Vice-President and\nreserved seats for women, peasants, workers and minorities in the\nBoard shall, be all members of Union Councils in the cantonment\nincluding Union Nazims and Naib Nazims. For reference relevant\nprovisions of the Ordinance are reproduced hereinbelow: -\n\n57. Franchise.-(1) Members of Union Councils\nincluding Union Nazims and Naib Union Nazims shall\nbe elected through elections based on adult franchise\nand on the basis of joint electorate.\n\n(2) The Electoral College for election of Vice-President\nand reserved seats of women, peasants and workers\nand minorities in the Board shall, be all members of\nthe Union Councils in the cantonment including Union\nNazims and Naib Nazims.\n\nExplanation.-For the purpose of this section, all\nmembers of Union Counsels notified as returned\ncandidates in the elections held under this Ordinance,\nshall be deemed to be members of the Electoral\nCollege.\n\n58.

Non-party  elections.--Local government\nelections in the cantonment shall be held on non-party\nbasis.\n\nCMA No.3258/2013 9\n\n10.\n\n62. Joint candidacy and elections. - (1) A Union\nNazim and Naib Union Nazim shall contest elections in\ntheir respective wards as joint candidates:\n\nProvided that on occurrence of a casual vacancy a\ncandidate for the office of a Union Nazim or Naib\nUnion Nazim shall contest the election for such office\nin his individual capacity;\n\n(2) Union Nazim and Naib Union Nazim securing the\nhighest number of votes, as joint candidates shall be\ndeclared elected.\n\nIt is to be noted that under the Cantonment laws,\n\ntotal number of 43 Cantonments have been created in Pakistan,\n\nwhich are as under: -\n\nBalochistan\n\n(1) Khuzdar Cantonment\n(2) Loralai Cantonment\n(3) Ormara Cantonment\n(4) Quetta Cantonment\n(5)  Zhob Cantonment\n\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa\n\n(6) Abbottabad Cantonment\n\n(7) Bannu Cantonment\n\n(8) Dera Ismail Khan Cantonment\n\n(9) Kohat Cantonment\n\n(10) Mardan Cantonment\n\n(11) Nowshera Cantonment\n\n(12) Peshawar Cantonment\n\n(13) Risalpur Cantonment\n\n(14) Havelian Cantonment\n\n(15) Kala Bagh/Murree Galies Cantonment\n\nPunjab\n\n(16) Attock Cantonment\n\n(17) Sanjwal Cantonment (adjacent to Attock Cantt)\n(18) Bhawalpur Cantonment\n\n(19) Chaklala Cantonment\n\n(20) Gujranwala Cantonment\n\n(21) Jhelum Cantonment\n\n(22) Kamra Cantonment\n\n(23) Kharian Cantonment\n\n(24) Mangla Cantonment\n\n(25) Multan Cantonment\n\n(26) Murree Hills Cantonment\n\n(27) Okara Cantonment\n\n(28) Rawalpindi Cantonment\n\n(29) Sargodha Cantonment\n\n(30) Shorkot Cantonment (PAF Rafiqui)\n(31) Sialkot Cantonment\n\n(32) Taxila Cantonment\n\nCMA No.3258/2013 10\n\n(33) Lahore Cantonment\n\n(34) Wah Cantonment\n\n(35) Walton Cantonment (Created out of the\nsouthern parts of the original Lahore Cantt.)\n\nSindh\n\n(36) Clifton Cantonment, Karachi\n\n(37) Faisal Cantonment, Karachi\n\n(38) Hyderabad Cantonment\n\n(39) Karachi Cantonment\n\n(40) Korangi Creek Cantonment, Karachi\n\n(41) Malir Cantonment, Karachi\n\n(42) Manora Cantonment, Karachi\n\n(43) Pano Aqil Cantonment\n11. It is pertinent to mention here that despite a clear\nmandate of law, elections of the Cantonment Local Government,\ni.e. Members of Union Councils including Union Nazims and Naib\nNazims, have not been held for the last 14 years. Similarly,\nFederal and Provincial Governments have also failed to hold\nelections of the Local Governments in all the Provinces and\nIslamabad Capital Territory through election Commission of\nPakistan.\n12. It may be observed that the life of a community is\nessentially the creation of its particular environment. It is difficult\nto establish an organization that would effectively look after the\nwell being of all the social groups in a country. Only such political\nsystem can succeed which is essentially indigenous. Therefore,\nestablishment of democratic institutions at the grass root level is\nbasic requirement for the welfare of the society. The Local Self-\nGovernment institutions lay the foundation of such a system.\nThey are based upon the recognition that the only way to respond\nto the needs of the individuals is to associate them with the\n\nprocess of authority. In this regard, it would be appropriate to\n\nquote Sydney Webb’s remarks who said that any system of\n\nCMA No.3258/2013 11\n\ngovernment, however mechanically perfect, would fail to take\nroots in the midst of the masses of people, unless it was in some\nway grafted on to the spontaneous grouping of the people\nthemselves. As such, the broad masses of people are to be\ngenuinely associated with the management of their affairs and\nencouraged to work for their own welfare. Essentially, the\ninstitutions at local/grass root levels protect the human dignity of\ncommon man to which he is entitled.\n\n13. Local Government or Municipal Government is a form\nof public administration, which in a majority of contexts, exists as\nthe lowest tier of administration within a given state or district. In\nmany countries, it usually comprises the third tier of government,\noften with greater powers than higher-level administrative\ndivisions. The question of municipal autonomy is a key question of\npublic administration and governance. It is noteworthy that Local\nGovernments generally act within powers delegated to them by\nlegislation or directives of the higher level of government. The\npolitical analysts have always emphasized on the importance of\nlocal self-government. There are two principles underlining the\nestablishment of Local bodies. Firstly, local bodies enjoy extensive\npowers to act in a way they like for the betterment of the\ncommunity unless restricted by law in any sphere of activity.\nSecondly, local bodies cannot go beyond the specific functions\ndelineated to them in various acts and statutes.\n\n14. The concept of participation of ordinary people in the\nconduct of public affairs was advanced by the liberal philosopher\nJohn Stuart Mill as early as the mid 19‘ century. He considered\n\nthe broad involvement of citizens to be the most effective\n\nCMA No.3258/2013 12\n\nguarantee of a well-functioning democratic polity,\ncounterbalancing the threats posed by an over-powerful and\ninterventionist state. In his view, the citizen’s opportunity to\narticulate his views and assert his rights afforded him the best\nprotection against any abuse of these rights by the state.\n\n15. In general, this tier of government is responsible for\ndecision-making in those policy areas which have a direct impact\non the lives of local citizens, e.g. urban regeneration, housing,\nschools, employment and social security, health, arts, culture and\nsport, local public transport, water and energy, and regional\nplanning. These are the areas where the local citizens must have\nthe opportunity to exert direct influence on policy-makers and\nthus participate in the decision-making process. Thus, local self-\ngovernment not only has a legal and a political dimension, but it\nalso has sociological connotations, namely, it directly affects\ncommunity life within a demarcated locality. It is pertinent to\nmention here that in the developed democracies, local self-\ngovernment has contributed substantially to social and economic\ndevelopment and the emergence of a civil society and its\nimportance for democratic development has been recognized\nconsistently all over the world.\n\n16. It is important to bear in mind that local government\nis the most vital element in a democracy, though not generally\nrecognized as such. Existence of local bodies is important for\nstrengthening the process of democracy. In the recent years, local\nself-government has been playing a vital role in the establishment\nof good governance and community development. The local\n\nbodies, at one end, provide services to the local community and,\n\nCMA No.3258/2013 13\n\non the other, act as an instrument of democratic self-government.\nThe existence of local self-government provides mechanism for\nthe enforcement of Fundamental Rights of the people. Such\ngovernment bodies are helpful for development including\neducation, health, social services as well as in improving law and\norder situation. In short, the local self-government is necessary\nnot only for strengthening democracy in country but also for\nsecuring good governance, which is essential to ensure the\nwelfare of the citizens. This tier of government is always\nappreciated by the general public because it remains within their\napproach, as such they get involved in the decision making\nprocess.\n\n17. All modern states have developed a system of self-\ngoverning local authorities. In many countries, the basic unit of\nlocal self-government is the municipality. Over the course of\nhistory, two types of self-governing units, namely, cities and\nmunicipalities have evolved at local level. The territorial\nboundaries of units of local self-government are defined by law.\nlocal self-government is presumed to be in existence where a\nlocal government is established as a legal, corporate and political\ninstitution with decision-making powers. One of the main traits of\nlocal self-government is that there must be a representative body,\na council or an assembly, directly elected by local citizens through\nelections, with budgetary autonomy and power to make\nlegislation at local level. The brief of local government structure in\nvarious countries is given hereinbelow: -\n\nINDIA\n\nIn India the local government is the third level of\n\ngovernment apart from the State and Central\n\nCMA No.3258/2013 14\n\ngovernments. There are two types. of Local\nGovernment in operation; firstly, Panchayats in rural\nareas and Municipalities in urban areas. The\nPanchayats are a linked-system of local bodies with\nvillage panchayats (average population about 5,000),\npanchayat samities at the intermediate level (average\npopulation about 100,000), and district panchaytas\n(average population about 1,000,000). The local\ngovernment bodies are the democratic institutions at\n\nthe basic level.\n\nFRANCE\n\nIn France there are three main tiers of local\nadministration; namely, the commune, department\nand region. These are both districts in which\nadministrative decisions made at national level are\ncarried out and local authorities with powers of their\nown. A local authority is a public-law corporation with\nits own name, territory, budget, employees, etc. and\nhas specific powers and a certain degree of autonomy\nvis-a-vis central government. In addition, there are\nFrance's overseas territories and regional bodies\n(collectivités territoriales) with special status (Paris,\nMarseille, Lyon, Corsica, Mayotte and Saint-Pierre-et-\nMiquelon).\n\nJAPAN\nSince the Meiji restoration, Japan has had a local\n\ngovernment system based on _ prefectures. The\nnational government oversees much of the country.\nMunicipal governments were historical villages. There\nare 47 prefectures. They have two- main\nresponsibilities; one is mediation between national\nand municipal governments, and the other is area\nwide administration. Now mergers are common for\n\ncost effective administration.\n\nTURKEY\n\nCMA No.3258/2013 15\n\n18.\n\nTurkey has two levels of local government; provinces\n(iller) and districts (il¢eler). The territory of Turkey is\nsubdivided into 81 provinces for administrative\npurposes. The provinces are organized into 7 regions\nfor census purposes; however, they do not represent\nan administrative structure. Each province is divided\n\ninto districts, for a total of 923 districts.\n\nSOUTH AFRICA\n\nSouth Africa has a two tiered local government\nsystem comprising local municipalities which fall into\ndistrict municipalities, and metropolitan municipalities\n\nwhich span both tiers of local government.\n\nPAKISTAN\n\nLocal government is the third tier of government in\nPakistan, after Federal Government and Provincial\nGovernment. There are three types of administrative\nunit of local government in Pakistan; namely, District\nGovernment Administrations, Town Municipal\nAdministrations and Union Council Administrations.\nThere are over five thousand local governments in\nPakistan. After the promulgation of Local Government\nOrdinance, 2001, there established democratically\nelected local councils, each headed by a Nazim\n(Supervisor or Mayor). Some of the districts\nconsisting of large metropolitan areas are called City\nDistricts. A City District often contains subdivisions\ncalled Towns and Union Councils. As per local\ngovernment laws, elections of union councils are to be\nheld after every four years. District Governments also\ninclude a District Coordination Officer (DCO), who is a\ncivil servant in-charge of all devolved departments.\nCurrently, the Powers of Nazim are also held by the\nDCO.\n\nThus, in the light of the above, it is imperative upon\n\nthe Government to ensure that the local government bodies\n\nCMA No.3258/2013 16\n\nelections as envisaged under the law must be held from time to\ntime so that the representatives of the people are enabled to\nparticipate in managing their affairs at the gross root levels and\nthe Fundamental Rights guaranteed under the Constitution are\nprotected and enforced.\n\n19. Hereinabove are the detailed reasons of our order of\neven date, relevant paras therefrom are _ reproduced\nhereinbelow: -\n\n“2. After discussing the issue at length in\npresence of Secretary Defence and also’ seeking\ninstructions from the Election Commission, who _ is\nresponsible to hold elections, following statement has been\nplaced on record:-\n\n“STATEMENT OF SECRTARY DEFENCE/ RESPONDENT\nNO. 1\n\nI, the Secretary Defence, respectfully request\nfor extension in time during which elections are to\nbe completed in the Cantonments boards and\nundertake that the entire process of the elections in\nall the Cantonment Boards shall be completed on or\nbefore the 15\" September, 2013.\n\nSd/-\n\nLt. Gen (Retd)\n\nAsif Yasin Malik\n\nSecretary Defence/Respondent No.1”\n\nThe petitioner also expresses his satisfaction on the above\nstatement.\n\n3. Thus, in view of commitment made on behalf\nof the Executive, we allow this application and extend the\nperiod of holding the elections in the Cantonment Boards\nup to 15\" September, 2013. Copy of this order be also\nsent to the Election Commission of Pakistan to ensure\nholding of the elections in terms of Constitutional\nprovisions (Article 32 read with Article 140-A) on or before\nthe 15 September, 2013.\n\n4. We extend our gratitude and place on record\nour thanks to learned Attorney General for Pakistan as on\n\naccount of his intervention the Executive has agreed to\n\nCMA No.3258/2013 17\n\nhold the elections of Cantonment Boards, after a period of\nabout 14 years.\n\n5. We may point out that in view of the\nconstitutional provisions and the principles of good\ngovernance, local bodies have to play an important role to\nachieve the welfare and good governance for the citizens\nof the country. At the same time we are also hopeful that\nthe provincial governments as well as the administration of\nIslamabad shall also make arrangements as early as could\nbe possible to hold local bodies elections in accordance\n\nwith law.”\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE\n\nJUDGE\n\nJUDGE\n\nIslamabad, the\n\n24 July, 2013\n\nNisar/*\n\nApproved For Reporting", "CleanedText": "ORDER IFTIKHAR MUHAMMAD CHAUDHRY, C.J.- This Civil Misc. Application has been filed on behalf of the respondent Federation through Secretary, Ministry of Defence, Government of Pakistan for seeking extension of time in the holding of Cantonment Elections in respect whereof, this Court, vide judgment dated 03.01.2013 had directed to complete the process of elections up to 05.05.2013. 2. Brief facts of the case are that the petitioner approached this Court by filing a petition under Article 184 3 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, inter alia, with the following prayer: - CMA No.3258/2013 2 It is, therefore, respectfully prayed that keeping in view the above submissions, the respondent No.1 may kindly be directed to issue Notification for the purpose of de-limitation of the wards in Cantonments and further be directed to prepare electoral roll of the wards in Cantonment and further be directed to hold election of the Cantonment Board forthwith in accordance with law. The petitioner s case was that under Article 32 read with Article 140A of the Constitution, it is incumbent upon the State to encourage Local Government Institutions comprising elected representatives of the area concerned with special representation of peasants, workers and women. It was not disputed that the elections to the Cantonment Boards, as required under section 14 1 b of the Cantonment Act, 1924 Act, 1924 were not conducted for about last 14 year on one pretext or the other. 3. During hearing of the matter, it was stated on behalf of the respondent Federation that in pursuance of provisions of section 14 1 b of Act, 1924, a summary had been moved to the Chief Executive/Prime Minister of Pakistan on 05.05.2012 with the proposal that it was necessary to vary the composition of 31 Cantonment Boards for a period of one year commencing from 05.05.2012, which was about to expire on 04.05.2013. It was also stated that as soon as approval was accorded by the Prime Minister allowing the Election Commission of Pakistan to hold elections to the Cantonment Boards, necessary administrative arrangements would be made in that behalf. Furthermore, by means of CMA No.5232/2012 it was, inter alia, stated that in compliance of order of the Apex Court dated 17.12.2012, it is submitted that this Ministry has no intention to seek further CMA No.3258/2013 3 extension which is still 04.05.2013 , in the existing Boards sought earlier vide section 14 1 of Cantonment Act, 1924. This Court vide order dated 03.01.2013 disposed of the petition with the direction that the Federal Government may not allow further extension in variation of composition of Cantonment Boards in terms of section 14 1 b of the Act, 1924 after 05.05.2013 unless conditions noted therein were required to be pressed into service compulsorily and in the meanwhile steps would be taken to ensure that the elections of Cantonment Boards were held after completing the process of the limitations of wards, etc., as per the Cantonment Ordinance, 2002 read with the Cantonments Local Government Elections Rule, 2012 as the Election Commission was also willing and ready to under the process of election. 4. By this Misc. Application for extension of time in the holding of Cantonment Boards Elections is being sought, inter alia, stating therein that a request for holding elections for the local government in the Cantonment areas was sent to the ECP vide letter dated 21.12.2012, but the ECP vide its letter dated 18.03.2013 raised certain legal questions/observations and advice of Law Justice Division was sought thereon. It is stated that pending the clarification of the said legal issues and the fact that the ECP was busy in holding general elections in the country, it was not possible to hold the Cantonment Boards elections by the target date fixed by this Court. 5. A written statement signed by the Secretary, Ministry of Defence was filed in Court, wherein he had requested for extension of time for holding of elections of the Cantonment Boards and undertaken that the entire process of elections in all CMA No.3258/2013 4 the Cantonment Boards would be completed on or before 15.09.2013. 6. Learned Attorney General appeared and explained that the Government is contemplating essential amendments in the relevant laws for the purpose of holding Cantonment Boards elections and since the process is likely to consume some time, therefore, extension of time in holding the elections be allowed. 7. It may be observed that prior to the Partition of the Subcontinent, the territory of Indo-Pak remained under the foreign domination for a long period, during which its traditional institutions were badly mutilated if they escaped extinction. The vast majority of people in the country lived in villages and small towns; therefore, it was required to evolve a system that would increasingly associate them with the ordering of their affairs. This could only be achieved through decentralization of the authority which had been vested in the District Officer under the British rule. In that scenario, a system was required to be evolved which has its roots in the public and after building a strong base goes on to construct the structure above. It had to be different from the system which had beautifully trimmed structure with all the frills of parliamentary democracy but hollow from within and without any base below. For a real democracy, it is necessary that all the inhabitants must have a say in their affairs. With the prevailing level of political consciousness, they can fully understand their immediate problems and requirements and evaluate what is of immediate good and what is not. There is little reason, therefore, why advantage of this should not be taken by involving them in the management of their affairs through directly chosen CMA No.3258/2013 5 representatives. For a villager it is, perhaps, not possible to assess with any degree of accuracy the qualities and disabilities of rival candidates from distant cities who may make periodic appearances at the time of elections, but he is surely a good judge of a fellow villager who may canvass for his vote for a local council. 8. After long time a solution was provided in the year 1979 in the shape of respective Local Government Ordinances for each province. The procedure for conduct of election of the Local Government was provided. However, by means of respective Local Government Elections Ordinance, 2000, new mechanism was provided for conducting the elections. Later, the local government laws were repealed through fresh Local Government Ordinance, 2001. The said Local Government Ordinances contain the procedure for the conduct of elections for each local area. For reference, the relevant provisions of Punjab Local Government Ordinance, 2001 are reproduced hereinbelow: - 12. Local governments for local areas.- 1 For each local area, there shall be a local government comprisinga District Government and Zila Council in a district or a City District; b Tehsil Municipal Administration and Tehsil Council in a tehsil; c Town Municipal Administration and Town Council in a town; and d Union Administration and Union Council in a union. 2 In case of a district consisting of a single Tehsil, the Government may dispense with setting up of Tehsil Council and holding of election of Tehsil Nazim and Naib Tehsil Nazim in such Tehsil and in that case the Tehsil Municipal Administration shall function directly under Zila Nazim and the functions of Tehsil Council shall be performed by the Zila Council. 3 In case of a Tehsil consisting of a single Union, the Government may dispense with setting up CMA No.3258/2013 6 of Tehsil Council and holding of election of Tehsil Nazim and Tehsil Naib Nazim in such Tehsil and in that case the functions of the Tehsil Municipal Administration shall be performed by the Union Administration and the functions of Tehsil Council shall be performed by the Union Council. 148.

It is to be noted that under the Cantonment laws, total number of 43 Cantonments have been created in Pakistan, which are as under: - Balochistan 1 Khuzdar Cantonment 2 Loralai Cantonment 3 Ormara Cantonment 4 Quetta Cantonment 5 Zhob Cantonment Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 6 Abbottabad Cantonment 7 Bannu Cantonment 8 Dera Ismail Khan Cantonment 9 Kohat Cantonment 10 Mardan Cantonment 11 Nowshera Cantonment 12 Peshawar Cantonment 13 Risalpur Cantonment 14 Havelian Cantonment 15 Kala Bagh/Murree Galies Cantonment Punjab 16 Attock Cantonment 17 Sanjwal Cantonment adjacent to Attock Cantt 18 Bhawalpur Cantonment 19 Chaklala Cantonment 20 Gujranwala Cantonment 21 Jhelum Cantonment 22 Kamra Cantonment 23 Kharian Cantonment 24 Mangla Cantonment 25 Multan Cantonment 26 Murree Hills Cantonment 27 Okara Cantonment 28 Rawalpindi Cantonment 29 Sargodha Cantonment 30 Shorkot Cantonment PAF Rafiqui 31 Sialkot Cantonment 32 Taxila Cantonment CMA No.3258/2013 10 33 Lahore Cantonment 34 Wah Cantonment 35 Walton Cantonment Created out of the southern parts of the original Lahore Cantt. Sindh 36 Clifton Cantonment, Karachi 37 Faisal Cantonment, Karachi 38 Hyderabad Cantonment 39 Karachi Cantonment 40 Korangi Creek Cantonment, Karachi 41 Malir Cantonment, Karachi 42 Manora Cantonment, Karachi 43 Pano Aqil Cantonment 11. It is pertinent to mention here that despite a clear mandate of law, elections of the Cantonment Local Government, i.e. Members of Union Councils including Union Nazims and Naib Nazims, have not been held for the last 14 years. Similarly, Federal and Provincial Governments have also failed to hold elections of the Local Governments in all the Provinces and Islamabad Capital Territory through election Commission of Pakistan. 12. It may be observed that the life of a community is essentially the creation of its particular environment. It is difficult to establish an organization that would effectively look after the well being of all the social groups in a country. Only such political system can succeed which is essentially indigenous. Therefore, establishment of democratic institutions at the grass root level is basic requirement for the welfare of the society. The Local SelfGovernment institutions lay the foundation of such a system. They are based upon the recognition that the only way to respond to the needs of the individuals is to associate them with the process of authority. In this regard, it would be appropriate to quote Sydney Webb s remarks who said that any system of CMA No.3258/2013 11 government, however mechanically perfect, would fail to take roots in the midst of the masses of people, unless it was in some way grafted on to the spontaneous grouping of the people themselves. As such, the broad masses of people are to be genuinely associated with the management of their affairs and encouraged to work for their own welfare. Essentially, the institutions at local/grass root levels protect the human dignity of common man to which he is entitled. 13. Local Government or Municipal Government is a form of public administration, which in a majority of contexts, exists as the lowest tier of administration within a given state or district. In many countries, it usually comprises the third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions. The question of municipal autonomy is a key question of public administration and governance. It is noteworthy that Local Governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. The political analysts have always emphasized on the importance of local self-government. There are two principles underlining the establishment of Local bodies. Firstly, local bodies enjoy extensive powers to act in a way they like for the betterment of the community unless restricted by law in any sphere of activity. Secondly, local bodies cannot go beyond the specific functions delineated to them in various acts and statutes. 14. The concept of participation of ordinary people in the conduct of public affairs was advanced by the liberal philosopher John Stuart Mill as early as the mid 19 century. He considered the broad involvement of citizens to be the most effective CMA No.3258/2013 12 guarantee of a well-functioning democratic polity, counterbalancing the threats posed by an over-powerful and interventionist state. In his view, the citizen s opportunity to articulate his views and assert his rights afforded him the best protection against any abuse of these rights by the state. 15. In general, this tier of government is responsible for decision-making in those policy areas which have a direct impact on the lives of local citizens, e.g. urban regeneration, housing, schools, employment and social security, health, arts, culture and sport, local public transport, water and energy, and regional planning. These are the areas where the local citizens must have the opportunity to exert direct influence on policy-makers and thus participate in the decision-making process. Thus, local selfgovernment not only has a legal and a political dimension, but it also has sociological connotations, namely, it directly affects community life within a demarcated locality. It is pertinent to mention here that in the developed democracies, local selfgovernment has contributed substantially to social and economic development and the emergence of a civil society and its importance for democratic development has been recognized consistently all over the world. 16. It is important to bear in mind that local government is the most vital element in a democracy, though not generally recognized as such. Existence of local bodies is important for strengthening the process of democracy. In the recent years, local self-government has been playing a vital role in the establishment of good governance and community development. The local bodies, at one end, provide services to the local community and, CMA No.3258/2013 13 on the other, act as an instrument of democratic self-government. The existence of local self-government provides mechanism for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights of the people. Such government bodies are helpful for development including education, health, social services as well as in improving law and order situation. In short, the local self-government is necessary not only for strengthening democracy in country but also for securing good governance, which is essential to ensure the welfare of the citizens. This tier of government is always appreciated by the general public because it remains within their approach, as such they get involved in the decision making process. 17. All modern states have developed a system of selfgoverning local authorities. In many countries, the basic unit of local self-government is the municipality. Over the course of history, two types of self-governing units, namely, cities and municipalities have evolved at local level. The territorial boundaries of units of local self-government are defined by law. local self-government is presumed to be in existence where a local government is established as a legal, corporate and political institution with decision-making powers. One of the main traits of local self-government is that there must be a representative body, a council or an assembly, directly elected by local citizens through elections, with budgetary autonomy and power to make legislation at local level. The brief of local government structure in various countries is given hereinbelow: - INDIA In India the local government is the third level of government apart from the State and Central CMA No.3258/2013 14 governments. There are two types. of Local Government in operation; firstly, Panchayats in rural areas and Municipalities in urban areas. The Panchayats are a linked-system of local bodies with village panchayats average population about 5,000 , panchayat samities at the intermediate level average population about 100,000 , and district panchaytas average population about 1,000,000 . The local government bodies are the democratic institutions at the basic level. FRANCE In France there are three main tiers of local administration; namely, the commune, department and region. These are both districts in which administrative decisions made at national level are carried out and local authorities with powers of their own. A local authority is a public-law corporation with its own name, territory, budget, employees, etc. and has specific powers and a certain degree of autonomy vis-a-vis central government. In addition, there are France s overseas territories and regional bodies collectivités territoriales with special status Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Corsica, Mayotte and Saint-Pierre-etMiquelon . JAPAN Since the Meiji restoration, Japan has had a local government system based on prefectures. The national government oversees much of the country. Municipal governments were historical villages. There are 47 prefectures. They have twomain responsibilities; one is mediation between national and municipal governments, and the other is area wide administration. Now mergers are common for cost effective administration. TURKEY CMA No.3258/2013 15 18. Turkey has two levels of local government; provinces iller and districts il eler . The territory of Turkey is subdivided into 81 provinces for administrative purposes. The provinces are organized into 7 regions for census purposes; however, they do not represent an administrative structure. Each province is divided into districts, for a total of 923 districts. SOUTH AFRICA South Africa has a two tiered local government system comprising local municipalities which fall into district municipalities, and metropolitan municipalities which span both tiers of local government. PAKISTAN Local government is the third tier of government in Pakistan, after Federal Government and Provincial Government. There are three types of administrative unit of local government in Pakistan; namely, District Government Administrations, Town Municipal Administrations and Union Council Administrations. There are over five thousand local governments in Pakistan. After the promulgation of Local Government Ordinance, 2001, there established democratically elected local councils, each headed by a Nazim Supervisor or Mayor . Some of the districts consisting of large metropolitan areas are called City Districts. A City District often contains subdivisions called Towns and Union Councils. As per local government laws, elections of union councils are to be held after every four years. District Governments also include a District Coordination Officer DCO , who is a civil servant in-charge of all devolved departments. Currently, the Powers of Nazim are also held by the DCO. Thus, in the light of the above, it is imperative upon the Government to ensure that the local government bodies CMA No.3258/2013 16 elections as envisaged under the law must be held from time to time so that the representatives of the people are enabled to participate in managing their affairs at the gross root levels and the Fundamental Rights guaranteed under the Constitution are protected and enforced. 19. Hereinabove are the detailed reasons of our order of even date, relevant paras therefrom are reproduced hereinbelow: - 2. After discussing the issue at length in presence of Secretary Defence and also seeking instructions from the Election Commission, who is responsible to hold elections, following statement has been placed on record:- STATEMENT OF SECRTARY DEFENCE/ RESPONDENT NO. 1 I, the Secretary Defence, respectfully request for extension in time during which elections are to be completed in the Cantonments boards and undertake that the entire process of the elections in all the Cantonment Boards shall be completed on or before the 15 September, 2013. Sd/- Lt. Gen Retd Asif Yasin Malik Secretary Defence/Respondent No.1 The petitioner also expresses his satisfaction on the above statement. 3. Thus, in view of commitment made on behalf of the Executive, we allow this application and extend the period of holding the elections in the Cantonment Boards up to 15 September, 2013. Copy of this order be also sent to the Election Commission of Pakistan to ensure holding of the elections in terms of Constitutional provisions Article 32 read with Article 140-A on or before the 15 September, 2013. 4. We extend our gratitude and place on record our thanks to learned Attorney General for Pakistan as on account of his intervention the Executive has agreed to CMA No.3258/2013 17 hold the elections of Cantonment Boards, after a period of about 14 years. 5. We may point out that in view of the constitutional provisions and the principles of good governance, local bodies have to play an important role to achieve the welfare and good governance for the citizens of the country. At the same time we are also hopeful that the provincial governments as well as the administration of Islamabad shall also make arrangements as early as could be possible to hold local bodies elections in accordance with law. CHIEF JUSTICE JUDGE JUDGE Islamabad, the 24 July, 2013 Nisar/ Approved For Reporting", "Sentences": ["ORDER IFTIKHAR MUHAMMAD CHAUDHRY, C.J.- This Civil Misc.", "Application has been filed on behalf

submissions, the respondent No.1 may kindly be directed to issue Notification for the purpose of de-limitation of the wards in Cantonments and further be directed to prepare electoral roll of the wards in Cantonment and further be directed to hold election of the Cantonment Board forthwith in accordance with law.", "The petitioner s case was that under Article 32 read with Article 140A of the Constitution, it is incumbent upon the State to encourage Local Government Institutions comprising elected representatives of the area concerned with special representation of peasants, workers and women.", "It was not disputed that the elections to the Cantonment Boards, as required under section 14 1 b of the Cantonment Act, 1924 Act, 1924 were not conducted for about last 14 year on one pretext or the other.", "During hearing of the matter, it was stated on behalf of the respondent Federation that in pursuance of provisions of section 14 1 b of Act, 1924, a summary had been moved to the Chief Executive/Prime Minister of Pakistan on 05.05.2012 with the proposal that it was necessary to vary the composition of 31 Cantonment Boards for a period of one year commencing from 05.05.2012, which was about to expire on 04.05.2013.", "It was also stated that as soon as approval was accorded by the Prime Minister allowing the Election Commission of Pakistan to hold elections to the Cantonment Boards, necessary administrative arrangements would be made in that behalf.", "Furthermore, by means of CMA No.5232/2012 it was, inter alia, stated that in compliance of order of the Apex Court dated 17.12.2012, it is submitted that this Ministry has no intention to seek further CMA No.3258/2013 3 extension which is still 04.05.2013 , in the existing Boards sought earlier vide section 14 1 of Cantonment Act, 1924.", "This Court vide order dated 03.01.2013 disposed of the petition with the direction that the Federal Government may not allow further extension in variation of composition of Cantonment Boards in terms of section 14 1 b of the Act, 1924 after 05.05.2013 unless conditions noted therein were required to be pressed into service compulsorily and in the meanwhile steps would be taken to ensure that the elections of Cantonment Boards were held after completing the process of the limitations of wards, etc., as per the Cantonment Ordinance, 2002 read with the Cantonments Local Government Elections Rule, 2012 as the Election Commission was also willing and ready to under the process of election.", "Application for extension of time in the holding of Cantonment Boards Elections is being sought, inter alia, stating therein that a request for holding elections for the local government in the Cantonment areas was sent to the ECP vide letter dated 21.12.2012, but the ECP vide its letter dated 18.03.2013 raised certain legal questions/observations and advice of Law Justice Division was sought thereon.", "It is stated that pending the clarification of the said legal issues and the fact that the ECP was busy in holding general elections in the country, it was not possible to hold the Cantonment Boards elections by the target date fixed by this Court.", "A written statement signed by the Secretary, Ministry of Defence was filed in Court, wherein he had requested for extension of time for holding of elections of the Cantonment Boards and undertaken that the entire process of elections in all CMA No.3258/2013 4 the Cantonment Boards would be completed on or before 15.09.2013.", "Learned Attorney General appeared and explained that the Government is contemplating essential amendments in the relevant laws for the purpose of holding Cantonment Boards elections and since the process is likely to consume some time, therefore, extension of time in holding the elections be allowed.", "It may be observed that prior to the Partition of the Subcontinent, the territory of Indo-Pak remained under the foreign domination for a long period, during which its traditional institutions were badly mutilated if they escaped extinction.", "The vast majority of people in the country lived in villages and small towns; therefore, it was required to evolve a system that would increasingly associate them with the ordering of their affairs.", "This could only be achieved through decentralization of the authority which had been vested in the District Officer under the British rule.", "In that scenario, a system was required to be evolved which has its roots in the public and after building a strong base goes on to construct the structure above.", "It had to be different from the system which had beautifully trimmed structure with all the frills of parliamentary democracy but hollow from within and without any base below.", "For a real democracy, it is necessary that all the inhabitants must have a say in their affairs.", "With the prevailing level of political consciousness, they can fully understand their immediate problems and requirements and evaluate what is of immediate good and what is not.", "There is little reason, therefore, why advantage of this should not be taken by involving them in the management of their affairs through directly chosen CMA No.3258/2013 5 representatives.", "For a villager it is, perhaps, not possible to assess with any degree of accuracy the qualities and disabilities of rival candidates from distant cities who may make periodic appearances at the time of elections, but he is surely a good judge of a fellow villager who may canvass for his vote for a local council.", "After long time a solution was provided in the year 1979 in the shape of respective Local Government Ordinances for each province.", "The procedure for conduct of election of the Local Government was provided.", "However, by means of respective Local Government Elections Ordinance, 2000, new mechanism was provided for conducting the elections.", "Later, the local government laws were repealed through fresh Local Government Ordinance, 2001.", "The said Local Government Ordinances contain the procedure for the conduct of elections for each local area.", "For reference, the

Contents of the report under the caption\n\nConst.P. 33/2013 2\n\n“CONCLUSIONS” have been read over including the following\n\nparas:\n\n‘viii. As per the prevailing practice of FIDIC or PEC based\ncontracts the bills of the contractors for actual work done\nare verified by the Consultants before payment. However,\nin case of claims these are first referred to project\nauthorities for their views and clearance and are then\nverified by the Consultant/Engineer (PMC in this case) for\nallowing payments. The insertion of sub clause (e) under\nthe heading certificates and payments clause 60.1, in all\nongoing contracts, has accrued the benefit to the\ncontractors to lodge claims directly to the PMC. The\nconsultant/Engineer PMC has been\nvetting/recommending these payments ON ACCOUNT\nwhich made it mandatory for the client to allow\npayments for claims.\n\nix. The major beneficiary on this account has been the JV\n(Logan - Tech - Habib), who has already received\npayment worth over Rs.4.0 billion, with verified claims of\nRs.0.5 billion lying pending for payment. Over and above\nthese, claims worth over Rs. 5.0 billion are pending with\nthe PMC. This is a major drain on the project, and\nexistence of this provision in the contract is an indirect\nenticement to the contractors to prolong the execution\nperiod to generate claims. This practice has been\ndiscontinued in the recently awarded work (one contract\nonly) through appropriate structuring of contract\ndocument. However, all ongoing contracts have this\nprovision with huge financial implications. This needs to\nbe addressed through mutual consultations/negotiations\nwith the contractors, as there is no clear cut legal remedy\navailable. This is a very serious lapse on part of the PRD\ndept of CAA which without due deliberations concluded\nthese contracts.\n\nx. Arbitrary decisions taken by the client at various stages\nof the project has led to not only major cost escalations,\nbut has also indirectly affected the scheduled working of\nthe overall design process. This has further delayed the\nprocess of award of contracts and execution of work.\nVarious committees/over sight bodies constituted at\ndifferent stages gave recommendations for major\nchanges in the scope of the project, which were then\napproved by the CAA Board. The Board obviously cannot\nbe blamed as it was not a technical forum to\ndeliberate/discuss such matters in the absence of detailed\ntechnical studies. Some of these issues are indicated as\nunder:\n\nConst.P. 33/2013\n\nThe change in the scope of the terminal building\n(PTB) in utter disregard to the _ planning\nparameters of the Master Plan/feasibility study\n(2006) initially designed to cater for 6.5 mppa, for\nmidterm period up to 2020 was enhanced to 9\nmppa, which was the ultimate figure for third\nphase of development up to year 2035. This excess\nspace created on the completion of PTB, will most\nlikely remain under utilized, though it has caused\nmajor design changes, delay in execution and\nenormous cost increase.\n\nUnder the package 01 the contract was awarded\nfor construction of one Main Runway, Parallel\ntaxiway and link taxiways to cater for the needs of\nair traffic load of 2020, as per the approved Master\nPlan of NBBIAP. It was also decided that the\nparallel taxiway could also be used for an\nemergency landing if the situation so arose.\nSubsequently the parallel taxiway was converted\ninto a full fledged secondary runway by the CAA on\nthe recommendations of the Steering Committee\nwhich held its meeting in Dec 2010 and\naccordingly its specifications were modified. The\naccumulated financial effect for this major change\nis around Rs.3.4 Billion. It is pertinent to mention\nthat due to distance of 230 meters instead of 1030\nmeters between the two runways, simultaneous\nflight operations cannot be undertaken.\n\nThese changes made during construction of Airside\npavements have further generated the\nrequirement of a 3™ runway for future operations,\nwith cost effect of Rs 8-10 Billion including parallel\nTaxiway but exclusive of cost of land. Another\nserious issue is regarding provision of lighting\nsystem for the Secondary runway. As at night only\none runway can be used for operations because of\nthe absence of appropriate lightening system for\ntaxi operations. Other proposed option given by\nCAA is to add link Taxiway for the landing aircrafts\nto go all the way to the end of the runway.\n\nThe Airside Infrastructure contract was awarded\nin August 2008 to M/s Legan-Husnain JV at a cost\nof Rs 11,825 million. The progress of this package\ntill January, 2010 stood at only 7-9% against the\nplanned progress of 65%, primary reason being\ninternal rift between the JV partners, Termination\nNotice was issued to the JV by the project\nauthorities on instructions of M/o Defence. In\nsharp contrast to the contractual obligations\nrequiring termination due to default/imposition of\npenalties and re-award of a new contract, the CAA\n\nConst.P. 33/2013 4\n\non the recommendations of a Committee under the\nchairmanship of Joint Secretary Admn. M/o\nDefence allowed formation of a new JV (Legan\n60% TAPL 35% and Habib 5%) with\nexclusion/addition of partners to implement the\ncontract on the same terms & conditions.\n\nThough provided in the above mentioned contract\nof JV to change its composition but only in the\nevent of normal performance by the JV. However,\nin this case the JV was at a default stage, and the\nonly course available was to terminate the\ncontract. Despite recommendations of the PMC for\ntermination of the contract, undue favour was\ngiven to the new JV by taking all the\nresponsibilities of delays by the _ Project\nManagement, which has accrued the right of\nclaiming idle charges by the new JV. This has\nalready resulted into payment of charges/claims of\nRs. 3.5 billion till to date to the new JV, with Rs 0.5\nBillion claims vetted and pending and another Rs\n5.0 Billion claims already lodged. This has resulted\nin to not only enormous increase in the contract\nvalue but also has caused expected 30 months\ndelay in the contract implementation.\n\nXi. There have been frequent changes of the Project Director\nie. Five Project Directors have worked during the period\n2006 - till date 2012, which has adversely affected the\nprogress and management of the project as a whole. The\nbifurcation of the project in to numerous packages\nentailed proper staffing of the PMU, with experienced and\ntechnically sound engineers who could oversee and\ncoordinate the various activities with contractors and the\nPMC. This however has remained a weak link. There has\nbeen some improvement in the physical progress of the\nproject during last six to seven months, however, there is\nan urgent need to further restructure and strengthen the\nPMU, besides delegation of appropriate authority to the\nPD for facilitating site decisions.”\n\nWhile going through the above contents of sub para ix. we\n\nenquired from the learned counsel appearing for respondent\n\nNo.3 and the learned counsel for other parties to explain the\n\ncomposition of JV LTH (Logan-Tech-Habib). Mr. Makhdoom Ali\n\nConst.P. 33/2013 5\n\nKhan, learned Sr. ASC stated that “Logan” is a limited company\nincorporated in Northern Island, U.K. but no one has appeared on\ntheir behalf, however, office of the same is situated in 16 Mayfair\nRoyal Apartments, Diplomatic Enclave, Islamabad. The\ncomposition of the share-holders is not known. As far as “Tech”\nis concerned, it stands for Technical Associates Private Ltd. and\nthe name of its Chief Executive is Mr. Faisal Munir, whereas\naccording to Form 29, Mian Munir is the share-holder whereas\nMr. Muhammad Shakeel s/o Jamil, etc. are the Directors. Their\naddress is 5-Baba Park, Upper Mall Road, Lahore. As far as\n“Habib” it stands for Habib Construction Ltd. and Mr. Shahid\nSaleem is its Chief Executive and their address is House No.15-A,\nCanal Bank Road, near Doctors Hospital, Johar Town, Lahore.\n\n2. It is informed that there are following 10 other\ncontractors whose names have been furnished but without\ndisclosing names of other partners, directors or the share-\nholders:-\n\nM/s.

Notice to all of them\nbe issued for the next date of hearing.\n3. Mr. Shahid Hamid, learned counsel stated that he is\nappearing on behalf of Mian Muhammad Munir who is not the\nChief Executive of Technical Associates Private Ltd. but as the\nnotice was served upon him being respondent No.4 in the\namended petition, therefore, he has appeared in response to the\nsame.\n4. Mr. Ozair Karamat Bhindari, learned ASC stated that\nhe has received instructions from Ms. Louis Berger consultants\nfor Benazir Bhutto International Airport and he also needs time\nto file a response. Let all the respondents file replies including\nrespondents No.1 & 2 the Government of Pakistan and others\nwhose names have been mentioned hereinabove if their replies\nhave not already been submitted. They are also required to file\nreply/comments of the paras of the report which have been\n\nreproduced hereinabove.\n\nConst.P. 33/2013 7\n\n5. It is important to note that respondent No.3 himself is\na signatory of the report but when we enquired from him what\naction he had taken after having gone through the parts of the\nreport which have been reproduced hereinabove, he could not\nanswer satisfactorily except saying that another committee has\nbeen constituted. We feel that in view of the observations which\nhave been made in the report, he had to take a prompt action in\norder to save the public exchequer. He is directed to file reply in\nthis regard before the next date of hearing. The learned\nAdditional Attorney General shall also assist the Court on behalf\nof the Federation on the points highlighted hereinabove. He\nwould also assist the Court about the method/procedure for the\nappointment of respondent No.3 Air Marshal (R) Khalid\nChaudhry, DG, CAA and to explain as to whether his appointment\nhas been made in a transparent manner under the Pakistan Civil\nAviation Authority Ordinance, 1982 and the rules made\nthereunder.\n\n6. It is to be noted that the Auditor General of Pakistan\nhas also published a report copy of which has been procured in\nHRC No. 24852-G of 2013. Respondents are also directed to give\ntheir re-action/comments on the said report as according to its\ncontents which has been published in the Daily News under the\n\nheadings “A Huge Loss of 30.37 Billion has been caused in the\n\nConst.P. 33/2013 8\n\nconstruction of Benazir Bhutto International Airport Islamabad”.\nThey may also get Photostat copy of the Auditor General’s Report\n\nfrom the office.\n\n7.

They are also required to file reply/comments of the paras of the report which have been reproduced hereinabove. 7 5. It is important to note that respondent No.3 himself is a signatory of the report but when we enquired from him what action he had taken after having gone through the parts of the report which have been reproduced hereinabove, he could not answer satisfactorily except saying that another committee has been constituted. We feel that in view of the observations which have been made in the report, he had to take a prompt action in order to save the public exchequer. He is directed to file reply in this regard before the next date of hearing. The learned Additional Attorney General shall also assist the Court on behalf of the Federation on the points highlighted hereinabove. He would also assist the Court about the method/procedure for the appointment of respondent No.3 Air Marshal R Khalid Chaudhry, DG, CAA and to explain as to whether his appointment has been made in a transparent manner under the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority Ordinance, 1982 and the rules made thereunder. 6. It is to be noted that the Auditor General of Pakistan has also published a report copy of which has been procured in HRC No. 24852-G of 2013. Respondents are also directed to give their re-action/comments on the said report as according to its contents which has been published in the Daily News under the headings A Huge Loss of 30.37 Billion has been caused in the 8 construction of Benazir Bhutto International Airport Islamabad . They may also get Photostat copy of the Auditor General s Report from the office. 7. Adjourned to 11 July, 2013 at SI. No.1. Chief Justice Judge Judge Islamabad 09.07.2013 Zulfiqar", "Sentences": ["ORDER In pursuance of our order dated 24.6.2013 a report prepared by General R Shahid Nawaz has been placed on record.", "Contents of the report under the caption 2 CONCLUSIONS have been read over including the following paras: viii.", "As per the prevailing practice of FIDIC or PEC based contracts the bills of the contractors for actual work done are verified by the Consultants before payment.", "However, in case of claims these are first referred to project authorities for their views and clearance and are then verified by the Consultant/Engineer PMC in this case for allowing payments.", "The insertion of sub clause e under the heading certificates and payments clause 60.1, in all ongoing contracts, has accrued the benefit to the contractors to lodge claims directly to the PMC.", "The consultant/Engineer PMC has been vetting/recommending these payments ON ACCOUNT which made it mandatory for the client to allow payments for claims.", "The major beneficiary on this account has been the JV Logan - Tech - Habib , who has already received payment worth over Rs.4.0 billion, with verified claims of Rs.0.5 billion lying pending for payment.", "Over and above these, claims worth over Rs. 5.0 billion are pending with the PMC.", "This is a major drain on the project, and existence of this provision in the contract is an indirect enticement to the contractors to prolong the execution period to generate claims.", "This practice has been discontinued in the recently awarded work one contract only through appropriate structuring of contract document.", "However, all ongoing contracts have this provision with huge financial implications.", "This needs to be addressed through mutual consultations/negotiations with the contractors, as there is no clear cut legal remedy available.", "This is a very serious lapse on part of the PRD dept of CAA which without due deliberations concluded these contracts.", "Arbitrary decisions taken by the client at various stages of the project has led to not only major cost escalations, but has also indirectly affected the scheduled working of the overall design process.", "This has further delayed the process of award of contracts and execution of work.", "Various committees/over sight bodies constituted at different stages gave recommendations for major changes in the scope of the project, which were then approved by the CAA Board.", "The Board obviously cannot be blamed as it was not a technical forum to deliberate/discuss such matters in the absence of detailed technical studies.", "Some of these issues are indicated as under: The change in the scope of the terminal building PTB in utter disregard to the planning parameters of the Master Plan/feasibility study 2006 initially designed to cater for 6.5 mppa, for midterm period up to 2020 was enhanced to 9 mppa, which was the ultimate figure for third phase of development up to year 2035.", "This excess space created on the completion of PTB, will most likely remain under utilized, though it has caused major design changes, delay in execution and enormous cost increase.", "Under the package 01 the contract was awarded for construction of one Main Runway, Parallel taxiway and link taxiways to cater for the needs of air traffic load of 2020, as per the approved Master Plan of NBBIAP.", "It was also decided that the parallel taxiway could also be used for an emergency landing if the situation so arose.", "Subsequently the parallel taxiway was converted into a full fledged secondary runway by the CAA on the recommendations of the Steering Committee which held its meeting in Dec 2010 and accordingly its specifications were modified.", "The accumulated financial effect for this major change is around Rs.3.4 Billion.", "It is pertinent to mention that due to distance of 230 meters instead of 1030 meters between the two runways, simultaneous flight operations cannot be undertaken.", "These changes made during construction of Airside pavements have further generated the requirement of a 3 runway for future operations, with cost effect of Rs 8-10 Billion including parallel Taxiway but exclusive of cost of land.", "Another serious issue is regarding provision of lighting system for the Secondary runway.", "As at night only one runway can be used for operations because of the absence of appropriate lightening system for taxi operations.", "Other proposed option given by CAA is to add link Taxiway for the landing aircrafts to go all the way to the end of the runway.", "The Airside Infrastructure contract was awarded in August 2008 to M/s Legan-Husnain JV at a cost of Rs 11,825 million.", "The progress of this package till January, 2010 stood at only 7-9 against the planned progress of 65 , primary reason being internal rift between the JV partners, Termination Notice was issued to the JV by the project authorities on instructions of M/o Defence.", "In sharp contrast to the contractual obligations requiring termination due to default/imposition of penalties and re-award of a new contract, the CAA 4 on the recommendations of a Committee under the chairmanship of Joint Secretary Admn.", "M/o Defence allowed formation of a new JV Legan 60 TAPL 35 and Habib 5 with exclusion/addition of partners to implement the contract on the same terms conditions.", "Though provided in the above mentioned contract of JV to change its composition but only in the event of normal performance by the JV.", "However, in this case the JV was at a default stage, and the only course available was to terminate the contract.", "Despite recommendations of the PMC for termination of the contract, undue favour was given to the new JV by taking all the responsibilities of delays by the Project Management, which has accrued the right of claiming idle charges by the new JV.", "This has already resulted into payment of charges/claims of Rs. 3.5 billion till to date to the new JV, with Rs 0.5 Billion claims vetted and pending and another Rs 5.0 Billion claims already lodged.", "This has resulted in to not only enormous increase in the contract value but also has caused expected 30 months delay in the contract implementation.", "There have been frequent changes of the Project Director ie.", "Five Project Directors have worked during the period 2006 - till date 2012, which has adversely affected the progress and management of the project as a whole.", "The bifurcation of the project in to numerous packages entailed proper staffing of the PMU, with experienced and technically sound engineers who could oversee and coordinate the various activities with contractors and the PMC.", "This however has remained a weak link.", "There has been some improvement in the physical progress of the project during last six to seven months, however, there is an urgent need to further restructure and strengthen the PMU, besides delegation of appropriate authority to the PD for facilitating site decisions.", "While going through the above contents of sub para ix.", "we enquired from the learned counsel appearing for respondent No.3 and the learned counsel for other parties to explain the composition of JV LTH Logan-Tech-Habib .", "Mr. Makhdoom Ali 5 Khan, learned Sr. ASC stated that Logan is a limited company incorporated in Northern Island, U.K. but no one has appeared on their behalf, however, office of the same is situated in 16 Mayfair Royal Apartments, Diplomatic Enclave, Islamabad.", "The composition of the share-holders is not known.", "As far as Tech is concerned, it stands for Technical Associates Private Ltd. and the name of its Chief Executive is Mr. Faisal Munir, whereas according to Form 29, Mian Munir is the share-holder whereas Mr. Muhammad Shakeel s/o Jamil, etc.", "Their address is 5-Baba Park, Upper Mall Road, Lahore.", "As far as Habib it stands for Habib Construction Ltd. and Mr. Shahid Saleem is its Chief Executive and their address is House No.15-A, Canal Bank Road, near Doctors Hospital, Johar Town, Lahore.", "It is informed that there are following 10 other contractors whose names have been furnished but without disclosing names of other partners, directors or the shareholders:- M/s.", "Husnain Cotex Limited M/s CRFG-CWE-TTP JV M/s

Respondent No.31 is directed to furnish details of their Directors, Share-holders and their addresses from the agreements which are executed with them from time to time.", "Notice to all of them be issued for the next date of hearing.", "Mr. Shahid Hamid, learned counsel stated that he is appearing on behalf of Mian Muhammad Munir who is not the Chief Executive of Technical Associates Private Ltd. but as the notice was served upon him being respondent No.4 in the amended petition, therefore, he has appeared in response to the same.", "Mr. Ozair Karamat Bhindari, learned ASC stated that he has received instructions from Ms. Louis Berger consultants for Benazir Bhutto International Airport and he also needs time to file a response.", "Let all the respondents file replies including respondents No.1 2 the Government of Pakistan and others whose names have been mentioned hereinabove if their replies have not already been submitted.", "They are also required to file reply/comments of the paras of the report which have been reproduced hereinabove.", "It is important to note that respondent No.3 himself is a signatory of the report but when we enquired from him what action he had taken after having gone through the parts of the report which have been reproduced hereinabove, he could not answer satisfactorily except saying that another committee has been constituted.", "We feel that in view of the observations which have been made in the report, he had to take a prompt action in order to save the public exchequer.", "He is directed to file reply in this regard before the next date of hearing.", "The learned Additional Attorney General shall also assist the Court on behalf of the Federation on the points highlighted hereinabove.", "He would also assist the Court about the method/procedure for the appointment of respondent No.3 Air Marshal R Khalid Chaudhry, DG, CAA and to explain as to whether his appointment has been made in a transparent manner under the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority Ordinance, 1982 and the rules made thereunder.", "It is to be noted that the Auditor General of Pakistan has also published a report copy of which has been procured in HRC No. 24852-G of 2013.", "Respondents are also directed to give their re-action/comments on the said report as according to its contents which has been published in the Daily News under the headings A Huge Loss of 30.37 Billion has been caused in the 8 construction of Benazir Bhutto International Airport Islamabad .", "They may also get Photostat copy of the Auditor General s Report from the office.", "Adjourned to 11 July, 2013 at SI.", "Chief Justice Judge Judge Islamabad 09.07.2013 Zulfiqar"], "SourceFile": "judgments_with_ocr_sentences_2013.json", "MergedTimestamp": "2025-10-28T20:59:55.637709"}

It is to be noted that\ntransfer/proprietary rights of the plots cannot be conferred merely on the\nbasis of allotment letters, unless there is proper documentation as per\nTransfer of Property Act, Stamp Act and Registration Act.

P.35 of 2013\n\ndeposit the amount noted above with the Registrar of this Court on or before\n19\" July, 2013, who shall invest the same in some profit bearing scheme.”\n\n2. Mr. Muhammad Azam Khan, Additional D.G. FIA has submitted a\nreport in respect of 321 kanals land and plots purchased in Sector F, Phase-\nI, DHA Islamabad, Rawalpindi. Details of the amounts have been\n\nmentioned as follows:-\n\nI “Purchase of 321 kanals land by EOBI from DHA, Islamabad\n\na. EOBI invested an amount of Rs.15.473 billion for purchase of\n321 kanal commercial land from DHA Islamabad through an\nagreement in January, 2012. The entire amount has been paid\nby EOBI to DHA in lieu of allotment letters of the plots but\nnothing is in physical possession of EOBI, as the said area\nhas not been fully developed so far.\n\nb. The property under reference was got evaluated by M/s\nDiamen Associates by EOBI. The employee of the evaluator\nwhen confronted during enquiry, it transpired that the land\nwas actually evaluated by one Shujja, a rep of the company\nbased at Islamabad, who had no relevant\nqualification/experience of evaluation of property involving\nsuch heavy amount as he had always been working in a\npharmaceutical company and it was his first experience.\n\nc. It is interested to note that EOBI got assessed 93 properties\npurchased by them from M/s Diamen Associates and paid an\namount of Rs.44 millions for the said job.\n\nd. During enquiry, various persons voluntrarily appeared before\nthe inquiry officer and claimed that the title/ownership of the\nproperty, which has been purchased by EOBI from DHA is\nstill not clear, for which the revenue authorities and CDA\nhave been asked to confirm the reality.\n\ne. The purchase has not been found in accordance with PPRA\nRules as neither any advertisement was given nor bids were\ninvited, hence, the transparency was seriously compromised\nin this shady deal.\n\nfi In terms of Clause 3.1 of the agreement dated 18.01.2012, the\nDHA was bound to given possession of land to EOBI after\nreceipt of the payment of total consideration, however, the\nsaid possession has not been delivered to EOBI so far.\n\ng. According to the agreement, DHA was supposed to complete\nthe development work within 03 months of the signing of\nagreement dated 18.1.2012, however, the same has not still\nbeen completed.\n\nh. Col. ® Tarig Mahmood, ex-Director DHA produced a copy of\nan agreement signed by DHA Islamabad, Bharia Town Ltd\n(BTL) and Habib Rafique Ltd. (HRL) on 2.6.2009. On perusal\nof the said agreement, it appears that according to various\n\nConst. P.35 of 2013 3\n\nclauses of the said agreement (clause 4.12, 5.4, 5.7 etc) DHA\nhad surrendered all rights of dealing with, marketing,\npromoting and selling of the said land (which is now a part of\nthe sale agreement executed between EOBI and DHA)\nSimilarly, according to clause 8.5, 8.52 (a,d), the DHA\nagreed that 70% proceed of the sale of the said commercial\narea will go to Bahria Town. In order to verify the existence\nof the said agreement, the officers of DHA, the management\nof HRL and Malik Riaz Hussain, who was one of the\nsignatory of the agreement on behalf f Bahria Town Limited\nhave been examined. All the three parties have stated that\nsubsequent to the agreement dated 2.7.2009 it was mutually\nallowed to DHA to sell the land in question to EOIB. This\naspect needs further verification during enquiry.\n\ni. The purchase of property has been made without approval of\nthe trustee, as pointed out in the audit report.\n\nSimilarly regarding purchase of Phase No.1, DHA following details have been\nfurnished:-\n\nTI Purchase _o roperty in _Phase-1, Sector F, DHA\nRawalpindi\n\na. The said purchase including 23 commercial plots (08\nmarlas each), 12 residential plots (02 kanal each), 162\ndefence villas of 03 bedrooms and 29 defence villas of 05\nbedrooms.\n\nb. The deal made on 5.3.2013 in lieu of consideration of\nRs.6.825 billion without prior approval of the BOT.\n\nCc. M/s NESPAK has been requested for evaluation of the\nsaid property as per market value, Similarly, CDA and\nICT Revenue Authorities approached for the\ndetermination of the title/ownership of the property.”\n\nWhen we inquired from learned counsel appearing for DHA as to whether in\ncompliance of direction of this Court amount of rupees 22.295 billion received\nfrom EOBI by DHA, have been deposited with the Registrar of this Court\npending decision of the case, he explained that DHA has transferred title of the\nplots to EOBI by issuing provisional allotment letter. We have examined the\nsame. Prima facie, this document by no standard can be considered to be a\ntransfer deed under the Transfer of Property Act read with Registration and the\nStamp Act, etc. However, he further stated that the amount received from the\n\nEOBI was spent in clearing the liabilities of the DHA and out of 22 billions\n\nConst. P.35 of 2013 4\n\nabout 12 billions have been paid to Bahria Town, Pvt. Ltd. for development\npurposes. Be that as it may, we are not concerned about merit of the transaction\nbetween DHA and Bahria Town because, prima facie, we noted that both EOBI\nand DHA have entered into transaction which is not transparent, as our concern\nis to watch and protect the interest of the old age employees, who are the\ncontributories to this fund and contribution is being deducted from their monthly\nsalaries.\n\n2. Therefore, under the circumstances, we direct that all the amounts lying in\nthe accounts of DHA Islamabad Rawalpindi respectively shall stand frozen\nhenceforth till the amount of Rs.22.295 is deposited with the Registrar. As far as\nthe transaction towards the receipt of the amount is concerned, no fresh account\nshall be opened and the already operating accounts shall remain accumulating\ntowards the amount noted herein above. However, during course of the day\nlearned counsel shall supply the complete account numbers maintained by DHA,\nIslamabad and Rawalpindi with the Banks (Financial Institutions) alongwith\nBalance in each account, to the Registrar. The concerned banks having accounts\nof DHA shall be sending daily report to the Registrar about the amount which is\nbeing received. In the meanwhile, whenever, both the DHAs agree to deposit the\namount an application shall be moved for passing appropriate orders. In view of\nthe facts and circumstances, the FIA shall continue its inquiries and proceed\nagainst those persons whosoever are responsible both from EOBI and from the\n\nDHAs, etc.\n\n3.

Azhar Malik *", "CleanedText": "ORDER On the last date of hearing we have passed the following order. Paragraph 2 of the same is reproduced as under:- 2. Mr. Ahmar Bilal, Soofi, learned ASC for DHA, controverted the stand and stated that title of plots have been conferred upon the owners by executing allotment letters in their favour. It is to be noted that transfer/proprietary rights of the plots cannot be conferred merely on the basis of allotment letters, unless there is proper documentation as per Transfer of Property Act, Stamp Act and Registration Act. Be that as it may, to watch the interest of the old age employees, who are the contributories to this fund and contribution is being deducted from their monthly salaries, we direct that pending decision of this Constitution Petition, the DHA shall Const. P.35 of 2013 deposit the amount noted above with the Registrar of this Court on or before 19 July, 2013, who shall invest the same in some profit bearing scheme. 2. Mr. Muhammad Azam Khan, Additional D.G. FIA has submitted a report in respect of 321 kanals land and plots purchased in Sector F, PhaseI, DHA Islamabad, Rawalpindi. Details of the amounts have been mentioned as follows:- I Purchase of 321 kanals land by EOBI from DHA, Islamabad a. EOBI invested an amount of Rs.15.473 billion for purchase of 321 kanal commercial land from DHA Islamabad through an agreement in January, 2012. The entire amount has been paid by EOBI to DHA in lieu of allotment letters of the plots but nothing is in physical possession of EOBI, as the said area has not been fully developed so far. b. The property under reference was got evaluated by M/s Diamen Associates by EOBI. The employee of the evaluator when confronted during enquiry, it transpired that the land was actually evaluated by one Shujja, a rep of the company based at Islamabad, who had no relevant qualification/experience of evaluation of property involving such heavy amount as he had always been working in a pharmaceutical company and it was his first experience. c. It is interested to note that EOBI got assessed 93 properties purchased by them from M/s Diamen Associates and paid an amount of Rs.44 millions for the said job. d. During enquiry, various persons voluntrarily appeared before the inquiry officer and claimed that the title/ownership of the property, which has been purchased by EOBI from DHA is still not clear, for which the revenue authorities and CDA have been asked to confirm the reality. e. The purchase has not been found in accordance with PPRA Rules as neither any advertisement was given nor bids were invited, hence, the transparency was seriously compromised in this shady deal. fi In terms of Clause 3.1 of the agreement dated 18.01.2012, the DHA was bound to given possession of land to EOBI after receipt of the payment of total consideration, however, the said possession has not been delivered to EOBI so far. g. According to the agreement, DHA was supposed to complete the development work within 03 months of the signing of agreement dated 18.1.2012, however, the same has not still been completed. h. Col. Tarig Mahmood, ex-Director DHA produced a copy of an agreement signed by DHA Islamabad, Bharia Town Ltd BTL and Habib Rafique Ltd. HRL on 2.6.2009. On perusal of the said agreement, it appears that according to various Const. P.35 of 2013 3 clauses of the said agreement clause 4.12, 5.4, 5.7 etc DHA had surrendered all rights of dealing with, marketing, promoting and selling of the said land which is now a part of the sale agreement executed between EOBI and DHA Similarly, according to clause 8.5, 8.52 a,d , the DHA agreed that 70 proceed of the sale of the said commercial area will go to Bahria Town. In order to verify the existence of the said agreement, the officers of DHA, the management of HRL and Malik Riaz Hussain, who was one of the signatory of the agreement on behalf f Bahria Town Limited have been examined. All the three parties have stated that subsequent to the agreement dated 2.7.2009 it was mutually allowed to DHA to sell the land in question to EOIB. This aspect needs further verification during enquiry. i. The purchase of property has been made without approval of the trustee, as pointed out in the audit report. Similarly regarding purchase of Phase No.1, DHA following details have been furnished:- TI Purchase o roperty in Phase-1, Sector F, DHA Rawalpindi a. The said purchase including 23 commercial plots 08 marlas each , 12 residential plots 02 kanal each , 162 defence villas of 03 bedrooms and 29 defence villas of 05 bedrooms. b. The deal made on 5.3.2013 in lieu of consideration of Rs.6.825 billion without prior approval of the BOT. Cc. M/s NESPAK has been requested for evaluation of the said property as per market value, Similarly, CDA and ICT Revenue Authorities approached for the determination of the title/ownership of the property. When we inquired from learned counsel appearing for DHA as to whether in compliance of direction of this Court amount of rupees 22.295 billion received from EOBI by DHA, have been deposited with the Registrar of this Court pending decision of the case, he explained that DHA has transferred title of the plots to EOBI by issuing provisional allotment letter. We have examined the same. Prima facie, this document by no standard can be considered to be a transfer deed under the Transfer of Property Act read with Registration and the Stamp Act, etc. However, he further stated that the amount received from the EOBI was spent in clearing the liabilities of the DHA and out of 22 billions Const. P.35 of 2013 4 about 12 billions have been paid to Bahria Town, Pvt. Ltd. for development purposes. Be that as it may, we are not concerned about merit of the transaction between DHA and Bahria Town because, prima facie, we noted that both EOBI and DHA have entered into transaction which is not transparent, as our concern is to watch and protect the interest of the old age employees, who are the contributories to this fund and contribution is being deducted from their monthly salaries. 2. Therefore, under the circumstances, we direct that all the amounts lying in the accounts of DHA Islamabad Rawalpindi respectively shall stand frozen henceforth till the amount of Rs.22.295 is deposited with the Registrar. As far as the transaction towards the receipt of the amount is concerned, no fresh account shall be opened and the already operating accounts shall remain accumulating towards the amount noted herein above. However, during course of the day learned counsel shall supply the complete account numbers maintained by DHA, Islamabad and Rawalpindi with the Banks Financial Institutions alongwith Balance in each account, to the Registrar. The concerned banks having accounts of DHA shall be sending daily report to the Registrar about the amount which is being received. In the meanwhile, whenever, both the DHAs agree to deposit the amount an application shall be moved for passing appropriate orders. In view of the facts and circumstances, the FIA shall continue its inquiries and proceed against those persons whosoever are responsible both from EOBI and from the DHAs, etc. 3.

At the hearing of the petition, it revealed that the case of\ndeceased lady could not be handled as per criminal law prevailing in\nthe country against culprits, reasons of which are still required to be\nunearth because insistence of petitioner to register FIR of murder of\nher daughter was not conceded to by Peshawar police at highest level.\nInasmuch as, without conducting autopsy, her dead body was\ndispatched from Peshawar to Islamabad in an ambulance but on her\nhue and cry, the police was compelled to get back the dead body from\na place known as Tarnol near Islamabad, to Peshawar, where allegedly\npost-mortem was conducted at 4:00 pm. Statedly instead of issuing\npost-mortem report, one of the parts of her body i.e. heart was sent to\nForensic Science Laboratory, Lahore as it was difficult to ascertain her\ncause of death. As such no FIR was registered except recording report\n\nvide Entry No.16 in Daily Diary of PS Shalimar, wherein her case was\n\ntreated to be covered under section 174 Cr.PC. It is stated that\ndeceased's husband is resident of Islamabad where she was living with\nhim along with her two children, therefore, her dead body was again\nbrought back to Islamabad in the house of her father-in-law, Bani\n\nAmin Khan who is IGP, Islamabad.\n\n5. The petitioner did not permit her burial without registering\nFIR and getting Post-Mortem. On this, FIR No.134/2013 dated\n19.05.2013, under section 302/34 PPC was registered at Police Station\nShalimar, Islamabad, knowing well that incident had taken place in the\n\narea of Town Police Station, Peshawar (KPK).\n\n6. On having issued process under HRC, reportedly no\neffective progress was made by concerned Authority, therefore,\npetitioner, Mst. Bibi Zahida submitted another application, contents\nwhereof are reproduced as under:-\nobinSl GI G5 95 pope Galo pula he Gls cass”\nwle ols\nTO nd390 yuo Cuers GS 59> i lal 5 wy wy blewe ile nS <a W158\n\nOB5 Sou GS yuoly tg quol whe AS 9> wid G55 prdigl ou>9 wiy Suc AS\n\n98 why Sou 59!

Waheeda @ Palwasha @ Honey,\n\nFIR should have not been registered at Islamabad. Contents of his\n\nstatement read thus:-\n\nStatement regarding case FIR No.134 P.S.\nShalimar, Islamabad\nOn 19.5.2013, at around 8 p.m. all officers were in the\nresidence of I.G. Islamabad regarding the funeral of his\ndaughter in law Miss Waheeda. The mother of the\ndeceased sat in front of the Ambulance and insisted for an\nFIR before the burial.\nAt this IG Islamabad directed SHO Shalimar Sajjad Haider\nand DSP Margalla Rashid to record their statement and\nregister the FIR. In compliance of his orders FIR\nNo.134/13 u/s 302/34 PPC P/S Shalimar was registered.\nSd/-\n\nYASEEN FAROOQ\nSSP/Islamabad”\n\nThe above statement was followed by another statement of the same\n\nofficer, which has been incorporated in the following para of the\n\nproceedings dated 04.07.2013:-\n\n8.\n\nSince the occurrence/incident had taken place at\nPeshawar, hence registration of FIR at Islamabad is not\nlegally justified. It may be noted that undersigned has not\npassed any orders for registration of FIR. It is further\nsubmitted that after verifying that the incident has actually\ntaken place in the jurisdiction of PS Town, Peshawar and\nlegal proceedings were already underway, cancellation\nreport in the subject case was prepared on 25.05.2013\nand the matter was referred to the Home Department,\n\nGovernment of KPK.”\n\nOn 04.7.2013 IGPs of KPK and Islamabad were asked to\n\nfurnish lists of officers/officials to whom they consider that right of\n\nhearing should be provided to them, lest, injustice may not be caused\n\nto them, if any adverse order is passed. Following lists were according\n\nfurnished: -\n\nList of KPK Police Officers\n\nAu fF WN\n\n. Ihsan Ghani, IGP\n\n. Imran Shahid, SSP (Operations)\n. Faisal, SP (Cantt)\n\n. Umar Farooq ASP, Town\n\n. Sardar Hussain, SHO Town\n\n. Rizwan Ullah, I.O.\n\nList of Police Officers of Islamabad\n\n1.\n\nMr\n\n. Bani Amin Khan, IGP, Islamabad\n\nMr. Yaseen Farooq, SSP (Operations),\nMr. Jameel Hashmi, SP Saddar Zone\n\n. Rasheed Niazi, DSP, Margalla\n\nMr. Sajjad Haider, SHO, PS. Shalimar\nMr. Rasheed Ahmed, SI, P.S. Shalimar\n\nAu FF WN\ns\n7\n\n9. Mr. Latif Afridi, ASC filed HRCMA No.98/2013, whereas Mr.\nBani Amin Khan, IGP Islamabad also filed HRCMA 97/2013. Similarly\n\nJamil Hashmi, SP filed separate application.\n\n10. We have heard to all of them in support of contentions put\nforward by them.\n\n11. Learned counsel for IGP, KPK contended that as per facts\ndisclosed to police, no evidence was available to conclude prima facie\nthat she died because of unnatural death, therefore, police after\nrecording report No.16 dated 19.05.2013 in the Daily Diary Register of\nPolice Station, proceeded to consider incident covered under section\n174 Cr.P.C. because in the meanwhile incomplete Post-Mortem report\nwas received and police surgeons/doctors were waiting for the result\nof Forensic Laboratory to whom, heart of deceased was sent for\nexamination to ascertain whether her death was natural or due to\n\nadministrating poison to her or due to asphyxia.\n\n12. However, in his presence, Mr. Ihsan Ghani, IGP, KPK\nstated that Bani Amin was insisting for registration of the case but he\nrefused to do so. Such statement he had also made on 03.07.2013\nduring the hearing of the case. As per Mr. Bani Amin Khan, IGP,\nIslamabad, he approached to everyone, responsible for registration of\n\ncase, including Moharar to IGP, KPK but no body listened him.\n\n13. It is important to note that learned counsel for IGP, KPK\nalso conceded that Police should have registered the case at Peshawar\nas there were allegations of murder against the father and brother of\n\nthe deceased.\n\n14. Learned Additional Advocate General, KPK also agreed that\nas per section 154 Cr.P.C. police had no option except to register the\ncase at the police station where incident of murder of deceased\n\nallegedly took place.\n\n15. It is to be observed that when there is no difference of\nopinion amongst all of them that case should have been registered u/s\n154 Cr.P.C. when matter was reported, the police administration is\nbound to follow the dictate of law, which has been explained by this\nCourt time and again. Reference may be made to the following paras\n\nof the judgments in the case of Muhammad Bashir v. Station House\n\nOfficer, Okara Cantt (PLD 2007 SC 539):-\n\n27. The conclusions that we draw from the above, rather\n\nlengthy discussion, on the subject of F.I.R., are asunder:-\n\n(a) no authority vested with an Officer Incharge of a\nPolice Station or with anyone else to refuse to record\nan F.I.R. where the information conveyed, disclosed\n\nthe commission of a cognizable offence.\n\n(b) no authority vested with an Officer Incharge of a\nPolice Station or with any one else to hold any\ninquiry into the correctness or otherwise of the\ninformation which is conveyed to the S.H.O. for the\npurposes of recording of an F.I.R.\n\n(c) any F.I.R. registered after such an exercise i.e.\n\ndetermination of the truth or falsity of the\n\n10\n\ninformation conveyed to the S.H.O., would get hit by\nthe provisions of section 162, Cr.P.C.\n\n(d) existence of an F.I.R. is no condition precedent for\nholding of an investigation nor is the same a\nprerequisite for the arrest of a person concerned\n\nwith the commission of a cognizable offence;\n\n(e) nor does the recording of an F.I.R. mean that the\nS.H.O. or a police officer deputed by him was obliged\nto investigate the case or to go through the whole\nlength of investigation of the case mentioned therein\nor that any accused person nominated therein must\n\nbe arrested; and finally that\n\n(f) the check against lodging of false F.I.Rs. was not\nrefusal to record such F.I.Rs, but punishment of such\ninformants under S.182, P.P.C. etc. which should be,\nif enforced, a fairly deterrent against misuse of the\nprovisions of S.154, Cr.P.C.\n\n16. Prior to above dictum, this Court in the case titled as the\n\nHuman Rights Case No.3212 of 2006 (2006 SCMR 1547) observed as\n\nunder:-\n\n3. I.G. Police is appearing in another case, which\npertained to District Sialkot, therefore, the above matter\nwas brought to his notice as he was present in the Court.\nD.P.O. Sheikhupura stated that now the case has been\nregistered by the police vide F.I.R. No.138, dated 28-4-\n2006 under section 302, P.P.C. and investigation is going\non. Non-registration of a criminal case wherein a murder\nhas taken place for a period about 2-1/2 years clearly\ndemonstrates inefficiency, and gross negligence on the\npart of the concerned Police Officers. It is well-settled\nthat during the investigation it is always better to collect\n\nevidence if available, as early as possible. We are not in\n\n11\n\na position to understand that in such a case where\nmurder has taken place what would be the result of the\nsame and particularly poor lady Mumtaz Bibi who has\nappeared and is complaining against the police attitude\nsaying that she had been approaching them again and\nagain for the purpose of registration of the case but no\none had listened her and at the end of the day D.P.O.\ncame to her rescue and directed the registration of the\ncase and entrusted investigation to S.P. Investigation.\nWe understand that matter will be investigated and\nevidence will be collected, sufficient or otherwise for the\npurpose of submitting challan but what would be the\nrecompense to the lady whose son has been killed in a\n\ngruesome manner.\n\n4. As far as the system of the law is concerned, the\nconstitution says that everyone is entitled to the\nprotection of the same and is entitled to get justice in all\nthe circumstances but the attitude of the police in this\ncase is irresponsible and on account of such attitude,\nmother of the deceased Mumtaz Bibi is bound to suffer\nthroughout her life, so long as she lives. As per her claim\nshe is a widow and after the death of her husband she\nhad taken it as a mission to bring up her children but in\nthe meanwhile this incident took place. The facts and\ncircumstances of the case which have been narrated\nbefore I.G. Police and Advocate-General, Punjab, her\nplight can be well-imagined by all of us. However, we\ndirect I.G. Police to take personal interest in the\n\ninvestigation of the case.\n\n5. Let this case remain pending and I.-G. Police shall\nsubmit report personally after every week in respect of\nthe progress of the case and even after the submission\nof challan it would be his responsibility to ensure that\nevidence is produced if ultimately evidence is not\n\navailable then it would be the liability/responsibility of\n\n12\n\nthe police department to compensate her in any manner\nwhatever they deem fit, under the circumstances. In the\nmeanwhile I.G. Police shall take strict disciplinary action\nagainst officers/officials who are responsible for not\nregistering the case ultimately after the happening of the\nincident as this Court observed time and again that it is\nthe duty of the police to register the case without any\ndelay and submit challan as far as possible within the\nperiod of fifteen days in terms of section 173, Cr.P.C.\nReference in this behalf may be made to Hakim Mumtaz\nAhmed and another v. The State PLD 2002 SC 590.\n\n17. Unfortunate aspect of the case is that IGP, KPK is taking\nresponsibility as noted above upon his shoulder not once but twice that\n\nhe had declined to register the case.\n\n18. Whereas on the other hand Bani Amin I.G.P, Islamabad,\nwhose daughter-in-law (wife of his son Ali Amin) has been murdered,\nmaintained that deceased was poisoned as according to him he had\nnoticed that: (i) her hands and feet were bluish; (ii) there were\nwounds on her lips; and (iii) spots on cheeks. To substantiate his plea,\nhe had also produced photographs of dead body, which were taken\nafter her death. Contention so raised, seems to be true as per\nphotographs. Not only this, he had also shown another photo to show\nthat a sign of administering injection was visible on her forearm, which\nhas also been confirmed by petitioner when picture was shown to her\nin Court.\n\n19. Prima facie these facts are sufficient to establish that\npolice of KPK abused their powers in not registering of FIR on\n\n19.05.2013 as in view of principles discussed hereinabove, in the\n\n13\n\njudgments and the law on the subject u/s 154 Cr.P.C. The IGP, KPK\nand his subordinates had no lawful authority to deny access to justice\nto petitioner. This is nothing but clearly a case of either inefficiency or\ncriminal negligence of the police for the reasons best known to them,\nincluding external pressure on all of them but a law abiding officer is\n\nnot supposed to deny due process of law to victim party.\n\n20. Importantly it is to be noted that during hearing of matter,\na case has been registered vide FIR No.366/2013, PS Town, District\nPeshawar dated 19.5.2013 u/s 302/34 PPC. Copy of FIR has been\n\nplaced on record.\n\n21. Now turning towards the conduct of Islamabad Police,\nwhich needs no discussion as per facts noted above and same are\nsufficient to conclude that all of them acted with sheer criminal\n\nnegligence, favouritism and inefficiency.\n\n22. The statement of IGP Bani Amin noted above is not\nacceptable as he being a senior police officer, without getting\nregistered FIR at Peshawar brought back dead body of her daughter-\nin-law to Islamabad where under his direction in respect of incident of\nPeshawar a case was got registered in Islamabad and subsequently a\nguard was posted on her grave, disclosure of which has been made by\nhim during hearing when pointed out by Mst. Bibi Zahida, reason\nshould be known to him. Inasmuch as, none amongst other officers\nwhose named he has furnished himself, refused to accede his illegal\ndemand including SP Jamil Hashmi, who now is trying to distance him\n\nfrom the illegal act.\n\n14\n\n23. Learned Additional Advocate General pointed out that\nprovincial government of KPK has constituted a committee to probe\ninto the incident of killing of Mst. Waheeda on 19.05.2013 for non\nregistration of the case in Peshawar and SSP Imran Shahid has been\n\nsuspended.\n\n24. Learned Deputy Attorney stated that Federal Government\nhas been conveyed about hearing of the case and registration of FIR at\nShalimar Police Station. He also agreed that no FIR in respect of\nincident, which had taken place about the alleged unnatural death of\nMst. Waheeda in the area of Town Police Station, Peshawar could have\n\nbeen registered at Shalimar Police Station.\n\n25. It is to be noted that heavy responsibility lies upon the law\nenforcing agencies, particularly, police to ensure that life and property\nof the people in terms of Article 9 of the Constitution is protected by\nthem but we are constrained to observe that in our country police is\nnot fulfilling its commitments efficiently, as a result whereof, law &\norder situation, all over the country, is worsening day-by-day. There\ncould be acceptable reasons, on account of which the forces including\nthe police, with other duties, maintain peace in society and bring the\nculprits to book without being influenced from anyone because once\nthe accused is involved in an offence, he and his near ones try their\n\nbest to ensure that he is saved from the clutches of law.\n\n26. We have in our police department such officers who are\nknown for their efficiency, credibility, commitment and whenever any\ntask is assigned to them, they do discharge their duty strictly in\n\naccordance with the Constitution and the law. However, justice does\n\n15\n\nnot mean that it should only be done to the culprits, because at the\nsame time, victims/sufferers also deserve for the same and their\ngrievance can only be redressed, if the accused are brought to book\n\nimmediately.\n\n27. In the instant case, as we have noticed, petitioner Bibi\nZahida is agitating that her daughter Waheeda @ Palwasha @ Honey\nhas been killed by her husband Darya Khan and son Khalid-ur-Rahman\nbut no one is ready to listen her, with the result she has to run from\npillar to post and ultimately matter reached in Human Right Cell of this\nCourt, where jurisdiction is exercised under Article 184(3) of the\nConstitution along with all other enabling provisions of law on\nindividual or collective requests, to ensure enforcement of fundamental\n\nrights, particularly, in public importance cases.\n\n28. There could be numerous complaints against the police\nthroughout in the country and some of them reach to this Court in its\nHuman Rights Cell, which is functioning continuously to redress the\ngrievances but despite of issuing directions, the law enforcing agencies\nfailed to redress the grievances of the complainants. In this context\n\nreference to the reported judgment in the case of the Human Rights\n\nCase No.3212 of 2006 (ibid) may be made, wherein a lady had been\n\nwaiting for a period of 2 % years but no one registered FIR of the\nmurder of her son and ultimately she succeeded in getting the justice\n\nfrom this Court. This is one case, there could be more than that.\n\n29. Thus, under the circumstances we direct that:\n(i) | The Federal and Provincial governments may take initiative\n\nfor improving the professional efficiency of the police\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\n(ii)\n\n16\n\ndepartment enabling them to meet with all types of\nchallenges to ensure that whosoever has taken the law in\nhis hands, notwithstanding the status, he has to face the\nconsequences.\n\nThe Police Department in all the Provinces and Islamabad\nshould strictly adhere to the Constitution and the law,\nwhile dealing with the criminal cases instead of showing\nany leniency or favouritism, either to the complainant or to\nthe accused, whatsoever the case may be.\n\nAs far as registration of the cases is concerned, they\nshould follow the law under section 154 Cr.P.C and the\nprinciples discussed hereinabove in light of Muhammad\nBashir’s case (ibid).\n\nAs in the instant case FIR has been registered at Peshawar\nbut on having seen the facts and circumstances, noted\nhereinabove, let the Federal and Provincial Governments\nensure that no influence is used by any of the police\nofficers who have already committed criminal negligence in\nnot handling the case of the deceased lady. The competent\nauthority should also deal with them in accordance with\nlaw on the subject.\n\nTo ensure transparent and independent inquiry, the Chief\nSecretary of KPK and Secretary Interior shall take steps to\nconstitute a team of independent police officers who shall\nbe responsible to conduct the investigation and submit\nchallan in the court of law accordingly.

Instant proceedings under Article 184 3 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 have originated from an application received from Mst. Bibi Zahida wife of Darya Khan. Petition has been entertained for enforcement of fundamental rights involving question of public importance about the denial of right of the general public to have excess to justice by the law enforcing agency i.e. the police, as a result whereof victims continuously suffered at the hands of culprits, leading to the increase of unrest/uncertainty in the society. 2. In the instant case, petitioner Mst. Zahida alleges murder of her daughter Waheeda Palwasha Honey, which took place on 19.05.2013 at the hands of her husband Darya Khan and son Khalidur-Rahman within jurisdiction of police station University Town, Peshawar. 3.

At the hearing of the petition, it revealed that the case of deceased lady could not be handled as per criminal law prevailing in the country against culprits, reasons of which are still required to be unearth because insistence of petitioner to register FIR of murder of her daughter was not conceded to by Peshawar police at highest level. Inasmuch as, without conducting autopsy, her dead body was dispatched from Peshawar to Islamabad in an ambulance but on her hue and cry, the police was compelled to get back the dead body from a place known as Tarnol near Islamabad, to Peshawar, where allegedly post-mortem was conducted at 4:00 pm. Statedly instead of issuing post-mortem report, one of the parts of her body i.e. heart was sent to Forensic Science Laboratory, Lahore as it was difficult to ascertain her cause of death. As such no FIR was registered except recording report vide Entry No.16 in Daily Diary of PS Shalimar, wherein her case was treated to be covered under section 174 Cr.PC. It is stated that deceased s husband is resident of Islamabad where she was living with him along with her two children, therefore, her dead body was again brought back to Islamabad in the house of her father-in-law, Bani Amin Khan who is IGP, Islamabad. 5. The petitioner did not permit her burial without registering FIR and getting Post-Mortem. On this, FIR No.134/2013 dated 19.05.2013, under section 302/34 PPC was registered at Police Station Shalimar, Islamabad, knowing well that incident had taken place in the area of Town Police Station, Peshawar KPK . 6. On having issued process under HRC, reportedly no effective progress was made by concerned Authority, therefore, petitioner, Mst. Bibi Zahida submitted another application, contents whereof are reproduced as under:- obinSl GI G5 95 pope Galo pula he Gls cass wle ols TO nd390 yuo Cuers GS 59 i lal 5 wy wy blewe ile nS a W158 OB5 Sou GS yuoly tg quol whe AS 9 wid G55 prdigl ou 9 wiy Suc AS 98 why Sou 59!

Waheeda Palwasha Honey, FIR should have not been registered at Islamabad. Contents of his statement read thus:- Statement regarding case FIR No.134 P.S. Shalimar, Islamabad On 19.5.2013, at around 8 p.m. all officers were in the residence of I.G. Islamabad regarding the funeral of his daughter in law Miss Waheeda. The mother of the deceased sat in front of the Ambulance and insisted for an FIR before the burial. At this IG Islamabad directed SHO Shalimar Sajjad Haider and DSP Margalla Rashid to record their statement and register the FIR. In compliance of his orders FIR No.134/13 u/s 302/34 PPC P/S Shalimar was registered. Sd/- YASEEN FAROOQ SSP/Islamabad The above statement was followed by another statement of the same officer, which has been incorporated in the following para of the proceedings dated 04.07.2013:- 8. Since the occurrence/incident had taken place at Peshawar, hence registration of FIR at Islamabad is not legally justified. It may be noted that undersigned has not passed any orders for registration of FIR. It is further submitted that after verifying that the incident has actually taken place in the jurisdiction of PS Town, Peshawar and legal proceedings were already underway, cancellation report in the subject case was prepared on 25.05.2013 and the matter was referred to the Home Department, Government of KPK. On 04.7.2013 IGPs of KPK and Islamabad were asked to furnish lists of officers/officials to whom they consider that right of hearing should be provided to them, lest, injustice may not be caused to them, if any adverse order is passed. Following lists were according furnished: - List of KPK Police Officers Au fF WN . Ihsan Ghani, IGP . Imran Shahid, SSP Operations . Faisal, SP Cantt . Umar Farooq ASP, Town . Sardar Hussain, SHO Town . Rizwan Ullah, I.O. List of Police Officers of Islamabad 1. Mr . Bani Amin Khan, IGP, Islamabad Mr. Yaseen Farooq, SSP Operations , Mr. Jameel Hashmi, SP Saddar Zone . Rasheed Niazi, DSP, Margalla Mr. Sajjad Haider, SHO, PS. Shalimar Mr. Rasheed Ahmed, SI, P.S. Shalimar Au FF WN s 7 9. Mr. Latif Afridi, ASC filed HRCMA No.98/2013, whereas Mr. Bani Amin Khan, IGP Islamabad also filed HRCMA 97/2013. Similarly Jamil Hashmi, SP filed separate application. 10. We have heard to all of them in support of contentions put forward by them. 11. Learned counsel for IGP, KPK contended that as per facts disclosed to police, no evidence was available to conclude prima facie that she died because of unnatural death, therefore, police after recording report No.16 dated 19.05.2013 in the Daily Diary Register of Police Station, proceeded to consider incident covered under section 174 Cr.P.C. because in the meanwhile incomplete Post-Mortem report was received and police surgeons/doctors were waiting for the result of Forensic Laboratory to whom, heart of deceased was sent for examination to ascertain whether her death was natural or due to administrating poison to her or due to asphyxia. 12. However, in his presence, Mr. Ihsan Ghani, IGP, KPK stated that Bani Amin was insisting for registration of the case but he refused to do so. Such statement he had also made on 03.07.2013 during the hearing of the case. As per Mr. Bani Amin Khan, IGP, Islamabad, he approached to everyone, responsible for registration of case, including Moharar to IGP, KPK but no body listened him. 13. It is important to note that learned counsel for IGP, KPK also conceded that Police should have registered the case at Peshawar as there were allegations of murder against the father and brother of the deceased. 14. Learned Additional Advocate General, KPK also agreed that as per section 154 Cr.P.C. police had no option except to register the case at the police station where incident of murder of deceased allegedly took place. 15. It is to be observed that when there is no difference of opinion amongst all of them that case should have been registered u/s 154 Cr.P.C. when matter was reported, the police administration is bound to follow the dictate of law, which has been explained by this Court time and again. Reference may be made to the following paras of the judgments in the case of Muhammad Bashir v. Station House Officer, Okara Cantt PLD 2007 SC 539 :- 27. The conclusions that we draw from the above, rather lengthy discussion, on the subject of F.I.R., are asunder:- a no authority vested with an Officer Incharge of a Police Station or with anyone else to refuse to record an F.I.R. where the information conveyed, disclosed the commission of a cognizable offence. b no authority vested with an Officer Incharge of a Police Station or with any one else to hold any inquiry into the correctness or otherwise of the information which is conveyed to the S.H.O. for the purposes of recording of an F.I.R. c any F.I.R. registered after such an exercise i.e. determination of the truth or falsity of the 10 information conveyed to the S.H.O., would get hit by the provisions of section 162, Cr.P.C. d existence of an F.I.R. is no condition precedent for holding of an investigation nor is the same a prerequisite for the arrest of a person concerned with the commission of a cognizable offence; e nor does the recording of an F.I.R. mean that the S.H.O. or a police officer deputed by him was obliged to investigate the case or to go through the whole length of investigation of the case mentioned therein or that any accused person nominated therein must be arrested; and finally that f the check against lodging of false F.I.Rs. was not refusal to record such F.I.Rs, but punishment of such informants under S.182, P.P.C. etc. which should be, if enforced, a fairly deterrent against misuse of the provisions of S.154, Cr.P.C. 16. Prior to above dictum, this Court in the case titled as the Human Rights Case No.3212 of 2006 2006 SCMR 1547 observed as under:- 3. I.G. Police is appearing in another case, which pertained to District Sialkot, therefore, the above matter was brought to his notice as he was present in the Court. D.P.O. Sheikhupura stated that now the case has been registered by the police vide F.I.R. No.138, dated 28-42006 under section 302, P.P.C. and investigation is going on. Non-registration of a criminal case wherein a murder has taken place for a period about 2-1/2 years clearly demonstrates inefficiency, and gross negligence on the part of the concerned Police Officers. It is well-settled that during the investigation it is always better to collect evidence if available, as early as possible. We are not in 11 a position to understand that in such a case where murder has taken place what would be the result of the same and particularly poor lady Mumtaz Bibi who has appeared and is complaining against the police attitude saying that she had been approaching them again and again for the purpose of registration of the case but no one had listened her and at the end of the day D.P.O. came to her rescue and directed the registration of the case and entrusted investigation to S.P. Investigation. We understand that matter will be investigated and evidence will be collected, sufficient or otherwise for the purpose of submitting challan but what would be the recompense to the lady whose son has been killed in a gruesome manner. 4. As far as the system of the law is concerned, the constitution says that everyone is entitled to the protection of the same and is entitled to get justice in all the circumstances but the attitude of the police in this case is irresponsible and on account of such attitude, mother of the deceased Mumtaz Bibi is bound to suffer throughout her life, so long as she lives. As per her claim she is a widow and after the death of her husband she had taken it as a mission to bring up her children but in the meanwhile this incident took place. The facts and circumstances of the case which have been narrated before I.G. Police and Advocate-General, Punjab, her plight can be well-imagined by all of us. However, we direct I.G. Police to take personal interest in the investigation of the case. 5. Let this case remain pending and I.-G. Police shall submit report personally after every week in respect of the progress of the case and even after the submission of challan it would be his responsibility to ensure that evidence is produced if ultimately evidence is not available then it would be the liability/responsibility of 12 the police department to compensate her in any manner whatever they deem fit, under the circumstances. In the meanwhile I.G. Police shall take strict disciplinary action against officers/officials who are responsible for not registering the case ultimately after the happening of the incident as this Court observed time and again that it is the duty of the police to register the case without any delay and submit challan as far as possible within the period of fifteen days in terms of section 173, Cr.P.C. Reference in this behalf may be made to Hakim Mumtaz Ahmed and another v. The State PLD 2002 SC 590. 17. Unfortunate aspect of the case is that IGP, KPK is taking responsibility as noted above upon his shoulder not once but twice that he had declined to register the case. 18. Whereas on the other hand Bani Amin I.G.P, Islamabad, whose daughter-in-law wife of his son Ali Amin has been murdered, maintained that deceased was poisoned as according to him he had noticed that: i her hands and feet were bluish; ii there were wounds on her lips; and iii spots on cheeks. To substantiate his plea, he had also produced photographs of dead body, which were taken after her death. Contention so raised, seems to be true as per photographs. Not only this, he had also shown another photo to show that a sign of administering injection was visible on her forearm, which has also been confirmed by petitioner when picture was shown to her in Court. 19. Prima facie these facts are sufficient to establish that police of KPK abused their powers in not registering of FIR on 19.05.2013 as in view of principles discussed hereinabove, in the 13 judgments and the law on the subject u/s 154 Cr.P.C. The IGP, KPK and his subordinates had no lawful authority to deny access to justice to petitioner. This is nothing but clearly a case of either inefficiency or criminal negligence of the police for the reasons best known to them, including external pressure on all of them but a law abiding officer is not supposed to deny due process of law to victim party. 20. Importantly it is to be noted that during hearing of matter, a case has been registered vide FIR No.366/2013, PS Town, District Peshawar dated 19.5.2013 u/s 302/34 PPC. Copy of FIR has been placed on record. 21. Now turning towards the conduct of Islamabad Police, which needs no discussion as per facts noted above and same are sufficient to conclude that all of them acted with sheer criminal negligence, favouritism and inefficiency. 22. The statement of IGP Bani Amin noted above is not acceptable as he being a senior police officer, without getting registered FIR at Peshawar brought back dead body of her daughterin-law to Islamabad where under his direction in respect of incident of Peshawar a case was got registered in Islamabad and subsequently a guard was posted on her grave, disclosure of which has been made by him during hearing when pointed out by Mst. Bibi Zahida, reason should be known to him. Inasmuch as, none amongst other officers whose named he has furnished himself, refused to accede his illegal demand including SP Jamil Hashmi, who now is trying to distance him from the illegal act. 14 23. Learned Additional Advocate General pointed out that provincial government of KPK has constituted a committee to probe into the incident of killing of Mst. Waheeda on 19.05.2013 for non registration of the case in Peshawar and SSP Imran Shahid has been suspended. 24. Learned Deputy Attorney stated that Federal Government has been conveyed about hearing of the case and registration of FIR at Shalimar Police Station. He also agreed that no FIR in respect of incident, which had taken place about the alleged unnatural death of Mst. Waheeda in the area of Town Police Station, Peshawar could have been registered at Shalimar Police Station. 25. It is to be noted that heavy responsibility lies upon the law enforcing agencies, particularly, police to ensure that life and property of the people in terms of Article 9 of the Constitution is protected by them but we are constrained to observe that in our country police is not fulfilling its commitments efficiently, as a result whereof, law order situation, all over the country, is worsening day-by-day. There could be acceptable reasons, on account of which the forces including the police, with other duties, maintain peace in society and bring the culprits to book without being influenced from anyone because once the accused is involved in an offence, he and his near ones try their best to ensure that he is saved from the clutches of law. 26. We have in our police department such officers who are known for their efficiency, credibility, commitment and whenever any task is assigned to them, they do discharge their duty strictly in accordance with the Constitution and the law. However, justice does 15 not mean that it should only be done to the culprits, because at the same time, victims/sufferers also deserve for the same and their grievance can only be redressed, if the accused are brought to book immediately. 27. In the instant case, as we have noticed, petitioner Bibi Zahida is agitating that her daughter Waheeda Palwasha Honey has been killed by her husband Darya Khan and son Khalid-ur-Rahman but no one is ready to listen her, with the result she has to run from pillar to post and ultimately matter reached in Human Right Cell of this Court, where jurisdiction is exercised under Article 184 3 of the Constitution along with all other enabling provisions of law on individual or collective requests, to ensure enforcement of fundamental rights, particularly, in public importance cases. 28. There could be numerous complaints against the police throughout in the country and some of them reach to this Court in its Human Rights Cell, which is functioning continuously to redress the grievances but despite of issuing directions, the law enforcing agencies failed to redress the grievances of the complainants. In this context reference to the reported judgment in the case of the Human Rights Case No.3212 of 2006 ibid may be made, wherein a lady had been waiting for a period of 2 years but no one registered FIR of the murder of her son and ultimately she succeeded in getting the justice from this Court. This is one case, there could be more than that. 29. Thus, under the circumstances we direct that: i The Federal and Provincial governments may take initiative for improving the professional efficiency of the police iii iv v ii 16 department enabling them to meet with all types of challenges to ensure that whosoever has taken the law in his hands, notwithstanding the status, he has to face the consequences. The Police Department in all the Provinces and Islamabad should strictly adhere to the Constitution and the law, while dealing with the criminal cases instead of showing any leniency or favouritism, either to the complainant or to the accused, whatsoever the case may be. As far as registration of the cases is concerned, they should follow the law under section 154 Cr.P.C and the principles discussed hereinabove in light of Muhammad Bashir s case ibid . As in the instant case FIR has been registered at Peshawar but on having seen the facts and circumstances, noted hereinabove, let the Federal and Provincial Governments ensure that no influence is used by any of the police officers who have already committed criminal negligence in not handling the case of the deceased lady. The competent authority should also deal with them in accordance with law on the subject. To ensure transparent and independent inquiry, the Chief Secretary of KPK and Secretary Interior shall take steps to constitute a team of independent police officers who shall be responsible to conduct the investigation and submit challan in the court of law accordingly.

death.", "Contention so raised, seems to be true as per photographs.", "Not only this, he had also shown another photo to show that a sign of administering injection was visible on her forearm, which has also been confirmed by petitioner when picture was shown to her in Court.", "Prima facie these facts are sufficient to establish that police of KPK abused their powers in not registering of FIR on 19.05.2013 as in view of principles discussed hereinabove, in the 13 judgments and the law on the subject u/s 154 Cr.P.C.", "The IGP, KPK and his subordinates had no lawful authority to deny access to justice to petitioner.", "This is nothing but clearly a case of either inefficiency or criminal negligence of the police for the reasons best known to them, including external pressure on all of them

he being a senior police officer, without getting registered FIR at Peshawar brought back dead body of her daughterin-law to Islamabad where under his direction in respect of incident of Peshawar a case was got registered in Islamabad and subsequently a guard was posted on her grave, disclosure of which has been made by him during hearing when pointed out by Mst.", "Bibi Zahida, reason should be

registration of FIR at Shalimar Police Station.", "He also agreed that no FIR in respect of incident, which had taken place about the alleged unnatural death of Mst.", "Waheeda in the area of Town Police Station, Peshawar could have been registered at Shalimar Police Station.", "It is to be noted that heavy responsibility lies upon the law enforcing agencies, particularly, police to ensure that life and property of the people in terms of Article 9 of the Constitution is protected by them but we are constrained to observe that in our country police is not fulfilling its commitments efficiently, as a result whereof, law order situation, all over the country, is worsening day-by-day.", "There could be acceptable reasons, on account of which the forces including the police, with other duties, maintain peace in society and bring the culprits to book without being influenced from anyone because once the accused is involved in an offence, he and his near ones try their best to ensure that he is saved from the clutches of law.", "We have in our police department such officers who are known for their efficiency, credibility, commitment and whenever any task is assigned to them, they do discharge their duty strictly in accordance with the Constitution and the law.", "However, justice does 15 not mean that it should only be done to the culprits, because at the same time, victims/sufferers also deserve for the same and their grievance can only be redressed, if the accused are brought to book immediately.", "In the instant case, as we have noticed, petitioner Bibi Zahida is agitating that her daughter Waheeda Palwasha Honey has been killed by her husband Darya Khan and son Khalid-ur-Rahman but no one is ready to listen her, with the result she has to run from pillar to post and ultimately matter reached in Human Right Cell of this Court, where jurisdiction is exercised under Article 184 3 of the Constitution along with all other enabling provisions of law on individual or collective requests, to ensure enforcement of fundamental rights, particularly, in public importance cases.", "There could be numerous complaints against the police throughout in the country and some of them reach to this Court in its Human Rights Cell, which is functioning continuously to redress the grievances but despite of issuing directions, the law enforcing agencies failed to redress the grievances of the complainants.", "In this context reference to the reported judgment in the case of the Human Rights Case No.3212 of 2006 ibid may be made, wherein a lady had been waiting for a period of 2 years but no one registered FIR of the murder of her son and ultimately she succeeded in getting the justice from this Court.", "This is one case, there could be more than that.", "Thus, under the circumstances we direct that: i The Federal and Provincial governments may take initiative for improving the professional efficiency of the police iii iv v ii 16 department

to the accused, whatsoever the case may be.", "As far as registration of the cases is concerned, they should follow the law under section 154 Cr.P.C and the principles discussed hereinabove in light of Muhammad Bashir s case ibid .", "As in the instant case FIR has been registered at Peshawar but on having seen the facts and circumstances, noted hereinabove, let the Federal and Provincial Governments ensure that no influence is used by any of the police officers who have already committed criminal negligence in not handling the case of the deceased lady.", "The competent authority should also deal with them in accordance with law on the subject.", "To ensure transparent and independent inquiry, the Chief Secretary of KPK and Secretary Interior shall take steps to constitute a team of independent police officers who shall be responsible to conduct the investigation and submit challan in the court of law accordingly.", "Both these functionaries shall submit report compliance

It is to be noted that, inter alia, the following grounds have been\nmentioned in the memo of petition to persuade this Court to grant the relief as\nnoted herein below:-\n\n“G) that the last 10 days of Ramadan are normally the\ndays of extensive spiritual and religious activity/worship\nand quite a number of the legislators may either be in\nAitekaf or proceed for Umrah to Saudi Arabia during this\nperiod.\n\n(ii) that 6\" August, 2013 shall fall on one of the last\nthree days of Ramadan, probably on 27\" day of Ramadan.\nThis would be too close to Eid-ul-Fitr and many\nParliamentarians may like to proceed their home-towns by\nthen.\n\n(ii) That the Constitution guarantees that “ the Muslims\nshall be enabled to order their lives in the individual and\ncollective spheres in accordance with the teachings and\nrequirements of Islam as set out in the Holy Quran and\nSunnah”\n\n(vi) That if the Presidential elections are held on 6\"\nAugust, 2013 (27\" Ramadan), the fundamental rights of\nthe Parliamentarians shall be infringed as they will not be\nable to participate in the Presidential elections in view of\ntheir engagements towards spiritual and religious plans in\nthe last ten days of the Holy month of Ramadan.\n\n(vii) That the impugned schedule is also violative of the\nfundamental rights of the Petitioner as well as other\nParliamentarians that if they opt to exercise their right of\nvote then they will have to give-up their spiritual and\nreligious plans i.e. (1) Umrah, (2) Aitekaf in Pakistan or at\nHarman Sharifan, KSA”\n\n2. In response to the notice, the learned Attorney General for Pakistan\n\nalongwith the Additional Secretary, ECP appeared. With their assistance, we\n\nConst.P.No.115/2012. 3\n\nhave gone through the Schedule announced by the ECP for the Election of the\n\nOffice of the President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the contents whereof\n\nare reproduced herein below:-\n\nSl. No. Events Date\n1 2 3\n(a) Filling of nomination papers with the 24.07.2013\nPresiding Officers at Islamabad and with\neach of the Presiding Officers at Lahore, (Upto 12:00 noon)\nKarachi, Peshawar and Quetta\n(b) Scrutiny of nomination papers by the 26.7.2013\nReturning Officer at Islamabad\n(at 10:00 AM)\n(c) Withdrawal of candidature before the 29.7.2013\nReturning Officer at Islamabad\n(Upto 12:00 noon)\n(d) Publication of the list of validly nominated 29.07.2013\ncandidates\n(at 1:00 p.m.)\n(e) Polling day and Polling time 06.08.2013\n(from 10:00 AM to 3:00\nPM)\n(f) Place of the Poll (1) The Parliament House,\nIslamabad.\n(2) The Provincia\nAssembly, Building\nLahore\n(3) The Provincia\nAssembly, Building,\nKarachi\n(4) The Provincia\nAssembly, Building,\nPeshawar\n(5) The Provincia\nAssembly, Building,\nQuetta\n3. It is pointed out by the Additional Secretary, ECP that the ECP has\n\nto complete the procedural formalities after publication of the list of the Validly\n\nNominated Candidates, therefore, the polling day and time has been fixed 6\" of\n\nAugust, 2013. When we pointed out to him the reasons on account of which, the\n\nConst.P.No.115/2012. 4\n\nrequest has been made for ante-dating the polling, as incorporated in the\npetition, he sought time to seek instructions from the ECP. Accordingly, the\n\nfollowing statement has been filed by him for consideration:-\n\n“The Election Commission has considered the matter regarding\nchange of Presidential Election Schedule. The Commission feels\nthat it shall require three clear days between withdrawal-day and\npoll-day to complete all necessary arrangements for conduct of\npoll. Whatever order is passed by this Hon’ble Court keeping this\n\nrequirement in view will be complied with in letter and spirit.”\n\n4. It may not be out of context to note that the holding of Election of\nthe Office of the President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan is one of the most\nimportant Constitutional Activity, which has to be undertaken by the ECP,\ntherefore, we are of the opinion that at the same time, it is the duty of the ECP to\nfacilitate all the voters and electors, enabling them to exercise their right of\nfranchise for the Election of the Office of the President of the Islamic Republic\nof Pakistan. Therefore, keeping in view the reasons/grounds put forward and\nalso to ensure that the ECP may discharge its functions.

Respondents\nFor the petitioner: Malik Muhammad Imtiaz Mahal, ASC\n\nwith the petitioner and Muhammad\nTariq present in person.\n\nOn Court's call: Mst.

Naseem\nAkhtar has been produced before the Court from the relevant Dar-ul-\nAman. Ali Muhammad petitioner and the two suitors of the alleged\ndetenue, i.e. Muhammad Imran Khan (respondent No. 2) and\nMuhammad Tariq are also in attendance. Mst. Naseem Akhtar has\nstated her age to be about twenty-eight years and admittedly Ali\n\nMuhammad petitioner is her father whereas Muhammad Tariq\n\nCriminal Petition No. 749-L of 2013 2\n\nhappens to be a maternal cousin of Mst. Naseem Akhtar.\nMuhammad Imran Khan respondent claims that he had got married\nto Mst. Naseem Akhtar on 14.05.2013 whereas Muhammad Tariq\nmaintains that Mst. Naseem Akhtar had got married to him on\n25.12.2012 and that their marriage is still intact. This assertion of\nMuhammad Tariq is accepted as correct not only by Ali Muhammad\npetitioner but also by Mst. Naseem Akhtar who has categorically\nand unequivocally stated before the Court that Muhammad Tariq is\nthe only person with whom she had contracted marriage which\nmarriage still subsists and that she had never contracted marriage\nwith Muhammad Imran Khan respondent. Mst. Naseem Akhtar has\nclearly and vociferously stated that while living with her father\nnamely Ali Muhammad petitioner she was not in any kind of\nconfinement or under any restraint and that she wants to go back\nand live with her father. We have been informed by the learned\ncounsel for the parties that Muhammad Tariq had lodged FIR No.\n101 at Police Station Shah Nikdar, District Sargodha on 10.08.2013\nfor an offence under section 496-A, PPC in respect of an alleged\nenticing away of Mst. Naseem Akhtar by Muhammad Imran Khan\nrespondent and the said criminal case is still under investigation of\nthe local police. We have also been apprised that on 26.06.2013\nMst. Naseem Akhtar had filed a suit for jactitation of marriage\nagainst Muhammad Imran Khan respondent which suit is presently\npending before the learned Judge, Family Court, Sillanwali, District\nSargodha. In the said suit Mst. Naseem Akhtar has claimed that she\nhad never got married to Muhammad Imran Khan and that the said\nMuhammad Imran Khan ought to be restrained from maintaining or\n\nproclaiming that Mst. Naseem Akhtar is his lawfully wedded wife.\n\n2. The relevant facts of the case referred to above\nunambiguously show that the alleged detenue namely Mst. Naseem\nAkhtar is a grown up young lady who acknowledges Muhammad\nTariq as her lawfully wedded husband and refuses to accept\nMuhammad Imran Khan respondent as her spouse. The said\ncategorical stand taken by Mst. Naseem Akhtar is also supported by\nher father namely Ali Muhammad petitioner. In that backdrop\n\nMuhammad Imran Khan _ respondent had ffiled Criminal\n\nCriminal Petition No. 749-L of 2013 3\n\nMiscellaneous No. 1057-H of 2013 before the Lahore High Court,\nLahore which petition had been filed under section 491, Cr.P.C. in\nthe nature of habeas corpus seeking recovery of Mst. Naseem Akhtar\nfrom the custody of her father namely Ali Muhammad petitioner. On\nthe basis of an order of the Court Mst. Naseem Akhtar was\nproduced before a learned Judge-in-Chamber of the Lahore High\nCourt, Lahore on 01.07.2013 and on the said date the following\norder had been passed by the Court:\n\n\"Mst. Naseem Akhtar, detenue, has been produced in the Court,\nwho submits that she had contracted marriage with Muhammad\nTariq on 15.12.2012 and the Nikahnama produced by the\npetitioner Muhammad Imran is forged one as she had not\ncontracted marriage with him.\n\n2. Learned counsel for the respondents wants to place on\nrecord certain documents showing that the petitioner's\nNikahnama is a fake document. Counsel shall submit document\non 04.07.2013.\n\n3. In view of two Nikahnamas existed on record, it would be\nappropriate to send detenue to Dar-ul-Aman, Lahore, wherefrom\nshe shall be produced in the Court on date fixed.\"\n\nOn the next date of hearing, i.e. 04.07.2013 the learned Judge-in-\nChamber of the Lahore High Court, Lahore had disposed of the said\n\nhabeas corpus petition with the following order:\n\n\"On the basis of existence of two Nikahnama on record in respect\nof Mst. Naseem Akhtar, she was lodged in Dar-ul-Aman, Lahore\nso that in the appropriate proceedings genuineness of the\nNikahnamas could be adjudicated by the court of competent\njurisdiction.\n\n2. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents\nsubmitted that Mst. Naseem Akhtar has filed a suit for jactitation\nof marriage and she cannot be detained in the Dar-ul-Aman for\nan indefinite period, rather her abode in the Dar-ul-Aman would\namount to illegal detention.\n\n3. This contention of the learned counsel is untenable for the\nreason that the Court cannot allow a person to live in immoral life\nand for this purpose she has been sent to Dar-ul-Aman to save\nher from the commission of an offence. She would stay in the\nDar-ul-Aman till the time her suit for jactitation of marriage is\ndecided. In this respect a direction is issued to the learned family\nCourt concerned for deciding the suit of Mst. Naseem Akhtar\nexpeditiously by taking proceedings on day to day basis before\nproceeding on summer vacations.\n\n4. Learned counsel for the petitioner has pointed out that the\nmother of Mst. Naseem Akhtar by adopting a deceitful method is\nalso residing alongwith her daughter in the Dar-ul-Aman. If it is\nso, the petitioner has the remedy before the Court upon whose\norder the mother of the detenue had joined her in Dar-ul-Aman.\n\nCriminal Petition No. 749-L of 2013 4\n\n5. With these observations, this petition is disposed of.\"\n\nAli Muhammad petitioner has approached this Court through the\npresent petition seeking release of his daughter namely Mst.\nNaseem Akhtar from the relevant Dar-ul-Aman whereat she\npresently stands lodged for an indefinite period as a result of the\nimpugned order passed by the learned Judge-in-Chamber of the\nLahore High Court, Lahore.\n\n3. It is evident from the facts of the present case that Mst.\nNaseem Akhtar is a grown up young lady and she is not involved in\nany criminal case as an accused person. Her consistent stand\nbefore the Lahore High Court, Lahore and before this Court has\nbeen that she was not in any kind of confinement or under any\nrestraint while living with her father. Although she has two rival\nsuitors yet she has expressed a clear desire before this Court that\nshe wishes to go and live with her father namely Ali Muhammad\npetitioner. We have found it to be rather disturbing that despite her\neagerness to continue living with her father she had been deprived\nof her liberty and ordered by the learned Judge-in-Chamber of the\nLahore High Court, Lahore to be lodged at a Dar-ul-Aman and that\ntoo for an indefinite period. It is quite ironical and shocking that\nhabeas corpus proceedings before the Lahore High Court, Lahore,\nwhich were meant to secure release of a person from an illegal or\nimproper custody or confinement, had been utilized in the present\ncase for depriving a free person of her liberty and the net result\nachieved was that a grown up young lady who was not found to be\nin any kind of confinement or under any restraint had been locked\nup and incarcerated within the confines of a Dar-ul-Aman for an\nindefinite period! Such an approach adopted and the result achieved\nby the learned Judge-in-Chamber of the Lahore High Court, Lahore\nsurely ran contrary to the very essence and purpose of a writ or\npetition for habeas corpus which is securing freedom and not\ncurtailing liberty. We are sure that the learned Judge-in-Chamber of\nthe Lahore High Court, Lahore would have done better if he had\nsought guidance in this regard from various judgments handed\n\ndown by this Court on the subject from time to time. Some of such\n\nCriminal Petition No. 749-L of 2013 5\n\nfoundational judgments are referred to by us in the following\n\nparagraph.\n\n4. In the case of Muhammad Rafique v. Muhammad Ghafoor (PLD\n1972 SC 6) it had been held by this Court as follows:\n\n\"Leave to appeal from the order of the High Court was\ngranted on 10.04.1970 to examine the legality of the direction\nthat Mst. Surraya Begum be given into the custody of the\nrespondent against her free will.\n\nOn hearing the learned counsel for the parties and taking\ninto consideration the provisions of sections 491, 561-A of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure and the Fundamental Right 1 that\n\"No person shall be deprived of life or liberty save in accordance\nwith law\" the Court found no warrant in law for the direction\ngiven by the learned Judge about the custody of Mst. Surraya\nBegum.\n\nSection 491, Cr.P.C., under which the High Court\nexercised jurisdiction inter alia provides:\n\n\"491.—(i) Any High Court may, whenever it thinks\nfit, direct—\n\n(a) that a person within the limits of its\nappellate criminal jurisdiction be brought up\nbefore the Court to be dealt with according to law;\n\n(b) that a person illegally or improperly\ndetained in public or private custody within such\nlimits be set at liberty;\"\n\n(The other clauses of the section are not relevant to\nthe present case).\n\nThe High court has two-fold jurisdiction under this section: (i) to\ndeal with a person within its appellate criminal jurisdiction\naccording to law; and (ii) to set him at liberty if he is illegally or\nimproperly detained. The question which falls for determination,\nhowever, is that if the Court finds that the person brought before\nit was not being illegally or improperly confined or detained what\norder can be passed regarding the custody of that person.\n\nIf the person is a minor, the court may make over his\ncustody to the guardian which will be dealing with him in\naccordance with law, but if the person is major, the only\njurisdiction which the court can exercise is to set him at liberty\nwhether illegally or improperly detained _in public or private\ncustody or not. The court may \"set at liberty\", but cannot restore\nstatus quo ante against the wishes of the person brought before it.\nSuch a course will lead to curtailment of liberty for which there is\nno warrant under section 491 nor can such an order be sustained\nunder section 561-A of the Code as it cannot be said that allowing\na person freedom of movement is an abuse of the process of the\nCourt.\"\n\n(underlining has been supplied for emphasis)\n\nCriminal Petition No. 749-L of 2013 6\n\nIt had been held by this Court in the case of Muhammad Nazir v.\nThe SHO Police Station, Shahpur and_3 others (1973 SCMR 351) as\n\nunder:\n\n\"After hearing the learned counsel for the parties, we are satisfied\nthat the learned Single Judge could not hand over the custody of\nthe girl to A.S.I. Illaqa as no case has been registered against her.\nThe case was registered against Muhammad Amir and Shah Wali.\nIn such circumstance, no order could _be passed against Mst.\nFatima Bibi. It is strange that the learned Single Judge did not\nrecord the statement of the girl to find out whether she is major\nor minor and handed over the custody of the girl to the Illaqa\nPolice for further investigation. This procedure is not warranted\nby any provision of the Criminal Procedure Code or any other law.\nThe girl has appeared before us. Her statement has been\nrecorded. She is major and is married to Muhammad Saeed. She\nwants to go with her husband. In these circumstances, the appeal\nis allowed and Mst. Fatima Bibi is set at liberty to go with her\nhusband.\"\n(underlining has been supplied for emphasis)\n\nThis Court had observed and held in the case of Mst. Sahi Bi v.\nKhalid _Hussain_and_6 others (1973 SCMR 577) in the following\n\nterms:\n\n\"After hearing the learned counsel for the parties, we are satisfied\nthat under the Mohammadan Law, a sui juris woman cannot be\nforced to live with her husband against her wishes. Quranic\ninjunction is against it. According to the Mohammadan Law, if\nthere is disagreement between the husband and the wife, the wife\nis entitled to live separately from her husband. In the present\ncase, there is disagreement between Mst. Irshad Begum and\nrespondent No. 1 and in such circumstance, she is entitled to live\nwith her mother.\n\nThe observation of the learned Single Judge of the High\nCourt that if Mst. Irshad Begum is set_at liberty she will lead\nimmoral life is irrelevant for the decision of the case under section\n491, Cr.P.C. Under section 491, Cr.P.C., if a sui juris detenue is\nunwilling to go with her husband or guardian, the Court\ncannot compel her to go with them. She must be set at\nliberty and allowed to move freely. This position was made\nclear in the above mentioned case decided by this Court\nand the learned Single Judge should have set at liberty the\ndetenu_and_ allowed her to move freely according to her\nwishes\".\n\n(underlining has been supplied for emphasis)\n\n5. For what has been discussed above this petition is converted\ninto an appeal and the same is allowed, the impugned order passed\nby the learned Judge-in-Chamber of the Lahore High Court, Lahore\non 04.07.2013 in Criminal Miscellaneous No. 1057-H of 2013 is set\n\nCriminal Petition No. 749-L of 2013 7\n\naside and the detenue namely Mst. Naseem Akhtar is set at liberty.\nShe may go and live with her father namely Ali Muhammad\n\npetitioner, as desired by her.\n\n6. Before parting with this judgment we may observe that we\nhave felt saddened by the fact that through the impugned order an\nHon'ble Judge of a High Court had allowed his responsibility of\nprotecting a _ citizen’s constitutional right to liberty to be\novershadowed by his own subjective sense of morality. In this\ncontext we have found the following part of the impugned order to\nbe utterly unacceptable and, if we may say so with respect,\n\ncompletely and unreservedly unpalatable:\n\n“2. Learned _ counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents\nsubmitted that Mst. Naseem Akhtar has filed a suit for jactitation\nof marriage and she cannot be detained in the Dar-ul-Aman for\nan indefinite period, rather her abode in the Dar-ul-Aman would\namount to illegal detention.\n\n3. This contention of the learned counsel is untenable for the\nreason that the Court cannot allow a person to live in immoral life\nand for this purpose she has been sent to Dar-ul-Aman to save\nher from the commission of an offence. She would stay in the\nDar-ul-Aman till the time her suit for jactitation of marriage is\ndecided.”\n\n(underlining has been supplied for emphasis)\n\nIt is unfortunate that in his zeal and eagerness to prevent\ncommission of an imagined or apprehended sin/crime the learned\nJudge-in-Chamber of the Lahore High Court, Lahore had not only\nchosen to ignore the Divine command but had also decided to\ndisregard the constitutional mandate. God Almighty has forbidden\neven leveling of an allegation of zina unless four eyewitnesses are\nproduced in support of such an allegation and if such number of\neyewitnesses are not produced then the person leveling the\nallegation is to be whipped and flogged. In the present case the\nlearned Judge-in-Chamber had not even leveled an allegation but\nhad only imagined a possibility of commission of zina in future and\nhad then proceeded to punish the detenue by depriving her of her\nliberty and putting her in the confines of a Dar-ul-Aman for an\nindefinite period. In these indefensible circumstances, after having\n\nbeen punished only for an imagined or apprehended sin, the\n\nCriminal Petition No. 749-L of 2013 8\n\ndetenue has appeared to us to be, in the words of Shakespeare’s\nKing Lear, a woman \"more sinned against than sinning\". Apart from\nthat the Constitution of Pakistan mandates that the judgments of\nthis Court are binding on all other courts in the country but while\npassing the impugned order the learned Judge-in-Chamber had\nfailed to follow the above mentioned, and many other, judgments\nrendered by this Court on the subject. It may be true that during\nthe pendency of a petition filed in the nature of habeas corpus a\ncourt can pass a rule nisi regarding interim custody of the alleged\ndetenue but it is unimaginable and unthinkable that after final\ndisposition of such petition the alleged detenue, who was otherwise\na free person, may be put to physical restraint or confinement for an\nindefinite period and that too not on the basis of any concrete fact\nor allegation but merely on the basis of an imagined possibility of\ncommission of a sin or a crime. The learned Judge-in-Chamber\nought to have known that it had been already been clarified by this\nCourt in the case of Muhammad Rafique (supra) that\n\n“\n\n------- if the person is major, the only jurisdiction which the\ncourt can exercise is to set him at liberty whether illegally or\nimproperly detained in public or private custody or not. The court\nmay \"set at liberty\", but cannot restore status quo ante against\nthe wishes of the person brought before it. Such a course will lead\nto curtailment of liberty for which there is no warrant under\nsection 491 nor can such an order be sustained under section\n561-A of the Code as it cannot be said that allowing a person\nfreedom of movement is an abuse of the process of the Court.\"\n\nIt appears that in the present case the learned Judge-in-Chamber of\nthe Lahore High Court, Lahore had transcended the legal\nrequirements applicable or relevant to the lis before him and had\ndecided to enter the realm of morality little appreciating that the\nfield chosen by him did not lie in his domain and it lied in a domain\nwhich he ought to have consciously avoided to enter.

Naseem Akhtar has been produced before the Court from the relevant Dar-ulAman. Ali Muhammad petitioner and the two suitors of the alleged detenue, i.e. Muhammad Imran Khan respondent No. 2 and Muhammad Tariq are also in attendance. Mst. Naseem Akhtar has stated her age to be about twenty-eight years and admittedly Ali Muhammad petitioner is her father whereas Muhammad Tariq Criminal Petition No. 749-L of 2013 2 happens to be a maternal cousin of Mst. Naseem Akhtar. Muhammad Imran Khan respondent claims that he had got married to Mst. Naseem Akhtar on 14.05.2013 whereas Muhammad Tariq maintains that Mst. Naseem Akhtar had got married to him on 25.12.2012 and that their marriage is still intact. This assertion of Muhammad Tariq is accepted as correct not only by Ali Muhammad petitioner but also by Mst. Naseem Akhtar who has categorically and unequivocally stated before the Court that Muhammad Tariq is the only person with whom she had contracted marriage which marriage still subsists and that she had never contracted marriage with Muhammad Imran Khan respondent. Mst. Naseem Akhtar has clearly and vociferously stated that while living with her father namely Ali Muhammad petitioner she was not in any kind of confinement or under any restraint and that she wants to go back and live with her father. We have been informed by the learned counsel for the parties that Muhammad Tariq had lodged FIR No. 101 at Police Station Shah Nikdar, District Sargodha on 10.08.2013 for an offence under section 496-A, PPC in respect of an alleged enticing away of Mst. Naseem Akhtar by Muhammad Imran Khan respondent and the said criminal case is still under investigation of the local police. We have also been apprised that on 26.06.2013 Mst. Naseem Akhtar had filed a suit for jactitation of marriage against Muhammad Imran Khan respondent which suit is presently pending before the learned Judge, Family Court, Sillanwali, District Sargodha. In the said suit Mst. Naseem Akhtar has claimed that she had never got married to Muhammad Imran Khan and that the said Muhammad Imran Khan ought to be restrained from maintaining or proclaiming that Mst. Naseem Akhtar is his lawfully wedded wife. 2. The relevant facts of the case referred to above unambiguously show that the alleged detenue namely Mst. Naseem Akhtar is a grown up young lady who acknowledges Muhammad Tariq as her lawfully wedded husband and refuses to accept Muhammad Imran Khan respondent as her spouse. The said categorical stand taken by Mst. Naseem Akhtar is also supported by her father namely Ali Muhammad petitioner. In that backdrop Muhammad Imran Khan respondent had ffiled Criminal Criminal Petition No. 749-L of 2013 3 Miscellaneous No. 1057-H of 2013 before the Lahore High Court, Lahore which petition had been filed under section 491, Cr.P.C. in the nature of habeas corpus seeking recovery of Mst. Naseem Akhtar from the custody of her father namely Ali Muhammad petitioner. On the basis of an order of the Court Mst. Naseem Akhtar was produced before a learned Judge-in-Chamber of the Lahore High Court, Lahore on 01.07.2013 and on the said date the following order had been passed by the Court: Mst. Naseem Akhtar, detenue, has been produced in the Court, who submits that she had contracted marriage with Muhammad Tariq on 15.12.2012 and the Nikahnama produced by the petitioner Muhammad Imran is forged one as she had not contracted marriage with him. 2. Learned counsel for the respondents wants to place on record certain documents showing that the petitioner s Nikahnama is a fake document. Counsel shall submit document on 04.07.2013. 3. In view of two Nikahnamas existed on record, it would be appropriate to send detenue to Dar-ul-Aman, Lahore, wherefrom she shall be produced in the Court on date fixed. On the next date of hearing, i.e. 04.07.2013 the learned Judge-inChamber of the Lahore High Court, Lahore had disposed of the said habeas corpus petition with the following order: On the basis of existence of two Nikahnama on record in respect of Mst. Naseem Akhtar, she was lodged in Dar-ul-Aman, Lahore so that in the appropriate proceedings genuineness of the Nikahnamas could be adjudicated by the court of competent jurisdiction. 2. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents submitted that Mst. Naseem Akhtar has filed a suit for jactitation of marriage and she cannot be detained in the Dar-ul-Aman for an indefinite period, rather her abode in the Dar-ul-Aman would amount to illegal detention. 3. This contention of the learned counsel is untenable for the reason that the Court cannot allow a person to live in immoral life and for this purpose she has been sent to Dar-ul-Aman to save her from the commission of an offence. She would stay in the Dar-ul-Aman till the time her suit for jactitation of marriage is decided. In this respect a direction is issued to the learned family Court concerned for deciding the suit of Mst. Naseem Akhtar expeditiously by taking proceedings on day to day basis before proceeding on summer vacations. 4. Learned counsel for the petitioner has pointed out that the mother of Mst. Naseem Akhtar by adopting a deceitful method is also residing alongwith her daughter in the Dar-ul-Aman. If it is so, the petitioner has the remedy before the Court upon whose order the mother of the detenue had joined her in Dar-ul-Aman. Criminal Petition No. 749-L of 2013 4 5. With these observations, this petition is disposed of. Ali Muhammad petitioner has approached this Court through the present petition seeking release of his daughter namely Mst. Naseem Akhtar from the relevant Dar-ul-Aman whereat she presently stands lodged for an indefinite period as a result of the impugned order passed by the learned Judge-in-Chamber of the Lahore High Court, Lahore. 3. It is evident from the facts of the present case that Mst. Naseem Akhtar is a grown up young lady and she is not involved in any criminal case as an accused person. Her consistent stand before the Lahore High Court, Lahore and before this Court has been that she was not in any kind of confinement or under any restraint while living with her father. Although she has two rival suitors yet she has expressed a clear desire before this Court that she wishes to go and live with her father namely Ali Muhammad petitioner. We have found it to be rather disturbing that despite her eagerness to continue living with her father she had been deprived of her liberty and ordered by the learned Judge-in-Chamber of the Lahore High Court, Lahore to be lodged at a Dar-ul-Aman and that too for an indefinite period. It is quite ironical and shocking that habeas corpus proceedings before the Lahore High Court, Lahore, which were meant to secure release of a person from an illegal or improper custody or confinement, had been utilized in the present case for depriving a free person of her liberty and the net result achieved was that a grown up young lady who was not found to be in any kind of confinement or under any restraint had been locked up and incarcerated within the confines of a Dar-ul-Aman for an indefinite period! Such an approach adopted and the result achieved by the learned Judge-in-Chamber of the Lahore High Court, Lahore surely ran contrary to the very essence and purpose of a writ or petition for habeas corpus which is securing freedom and not curtailing liberty. We are sure that the learned Judge-in-Chamber of the Lahore High Court, Lahore would have done better if he had sought guidance in this regard from various judgments handed down by this Court on the subject from time to time. Some of such Criminal Petition No. 749-L of 2013 5 foundational judgments are referred to by us in the following paragraph. 4. In the case of Muhammad Rafique v. Muhammad Ghafoor PLD 1972 SC 6 it had been held by this Court as follows: Leave to appeal from the order of the High Court was granted on 10.04.1970 to examine the legality of the direction that Mst. Surraya Begum be given into the custody of the respondent against her free will. On hearing the learned counsel for the parties and taking into consideration the provisions of sections 491, 561-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Fundamental Right 1 that No person shall be deprived of life or liberty save in accordance with law the Court found no warrant in law for the direction given by the learned Judge about the custody of Mst. Surraya Begum. Section 491, Cr.P.C., under which the High Court exercised jurisdiction inter alia provides: 491. i Any High Court may, whenever it thinks fit, direct a that a person within the limits of its appellate criminal jurisdiction be brought up before the Court to be dealt with according to law; b that a person illegally or improperly detained in public or private custody within such limits be set at liberty; The other clauses of the section are not relevant to the present case . The High court has two-fold jurisdiction under this section: i to deal with a person within its appellate criminal jurisdiction according to law; and ii to set him at liberty if he is illegally or improperly detained. The question which falls for determination, however, is that if the Court finds that the person brought before it was not being illegally or improperly confined or detained what order can be passed regarding the custody of that person. If the person is a minor, the court may make over his custody to the guardian which will be dealing with him in accordance with law, but if the person is major, the only jurisdiction which the court can exercise is to set him at liberty whether illegally or improperly detained in public or private custody or not. The court may set at liberty , but cannot restore status quo ante against the wishes of the person brought before it. Such a course will lead to curtailment of liberty for which there is no warrant under section 491 nor can such an order be sustained under section 561-A of the Code as it cannot be said that allowing a person freedom of movement is an abuse of the process of the Court. underlining has been supplied for emphasis Criminal Petition No. 749-L of 2013 6 It had been held by this Court in the case of Muhammad Nazir v. The SHO Police Station, Shahpur and 3 others 1973 SCMR 351 as under: After hearing the learned counsel for the parties, we are satisfied that the learned Single Judge could not hand over the custody of the girl to A.S.I. Illaqa as no case has been registered against her. The case was registered against Muhammad Amir and Shah Wali. In such circumstance, no order could be passed against Mst. Fatima Bibi. It is strange that the learned Single Judge did not record the statement of the girl to find out whether she is major or minor and handed over the custody of the girl to the Illaqa Police for further investigation. This procedure is not warranted by any provision of the Criminal Procedure Code or any other law. The girl has appeared before us. Her statement has been recorded. She is major and is married to Muhammad Saeed. She wants to go with her husband. In these circumstances, the appeal is allowed and Mst. Fatima Bibi is set at liberty to go with her husband. underlining has been supplied for emphasis This Court had observed and held in the case of Mst. Sahi Bi v. Khalid Hussain and 6 others 1973 SCMR 577 in the following terms: After hearing the learned counsel for the parties, we are satisfied that under the Mohammadan Law, a sui juris woman cannot be forced to live with her husband against her wishes. Quranic injunction is against it. According to the Mohammadan Law, if there is disagreement between the husband and the wife, the wife is entitled to live separately from her husband. In the present case, there is disagreement between Mst. Irshad Begum and respondent No. 1 and in such circumstance, she is entitled to live with her mother. The observation of the learned Single Judge of the High Court that if Mst. Irshad Begum is set at liberty she will lead immoral life is irrelevant for the decision of the case under section 491, Cr.P.C. Under section 491, Cr.P.C., if a sui juris detenue is unwilling to go with her husband or guardian, the Court cannot compel her to go with them. She must be set at liberty and allowed to move freely. This position was made clear in the above mentioned case decided by this Court and the learned Single Judge should have set at liberty the detenu and allowed her to move freely according to her wishes . underlining has been supplied for emphasis 5. For what has been discussed above this petition is converted into an appeal and the same is allowed, the impugned order passed by the learned Judge-in-Chamber of the Lahore High Court, Lahore on 04.07.2013 in Criminal Miscellaneous No. 1057-H of 2013 is set Criminal Petition No. 749-L of 2013 7 aside and the detenue namely Mst. Naseem Akhtar is set at liberty. She may go and live with her father namely Ali Muhammad petitioner, as desired by her. 6. Before parting with this judgment we may observe that we have felt saddened by the fact that through the impugned order an Hon ble Judge of a High Court had allowed his responsibility of protecting a citizen s constitutional right to liberty to be overshadowed by his own subjective sense of morality. In this context we have found the following part of the impugned order to be utterly unacceptable and, if we may say so with respect, completely and unreservedly unpalatable: 2. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents submitted that Mst. Naseem Akhtar has filed a suit for jactitation of marriage and she cannot be detained in the Dar-ul-Aman for an indefinite period, rather her abode in the Dar-ul-Aman would amount to illegal detention. 3. This contention of the learned counsel is untenable for the reason that the Court cannot allow a person to live in immoral life and for this purpose she has been sent to Dar-ul-Aman to save her from the commission of an offence. She would stay in the Dar-ul-Aman till the time her suit for jactitation of marriage is decided. underlining has been supplied for emphasis It is unfortunate that in his zeal and eagerness to prevent commission of an imagined or apprehended sin/crime the learned Judge-in-Chamber of the Lahore High Court, Lahore had not only chosen to ignore the Divine command but had also decided to disregard the constitutional mandate. God Almighty has forbidden even leveling of an allegation of zina unless four eyewitnesses are produced in support of such an allegation and if such number of eyewitnesses are not produced then the person leveling the allegation is to be whipped and flogged. In the present case the learned Judge-in-Chamber had not even leveled an allegation but had only imagined a possibility of commission of zina in future and had then proceeded to punish the detenue by depriving her of her liberty and putting her in the confines of a Dar-ul-Aman for an indefinite period.

Akhtar is set at liberty.", "She may go and live with her father namely Ali Muhammad petitioner, as desired by her.", "Before parting with this judgment we may observe that we have felt saddened by the fact that through the impugned order an Hon ble Judge of a High Court had allowed his responsibility of protecting a citizen s constitutional right to liberty to be overshadowed by his own subjective sense of morality.", "In this context we have found the following part of the impugned order to be utterly unacceptable and, if we may say so with respect, completely and unreservedly unpalatable: 2.", "Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents submitted that Mst.", "Naseem Akhtar has filed a suit for jactitation of marriage and she cannot be detained in the Dar-ul-Aman for an indefinite period, rather her abode in the Dar-ul-Aman would amount to illegal detention.", "This contention of the learned counsel is untenable for the reason that the Court cannot

even leveling of an allegation of zina unless four eyewitnesses are produced in support of such an allegation and if such number of eyewitnesses are not produced then the person leveling the

had then proceeded to punish the detenue by depriving her of her liberty and putting her in the confines of a Dar-ul-Aman for an indefinite period.", "In these indefensible circumstances, after having

than sinning .", "Apart from that the Constitution of Pakistan mandates that the judgments of this Court are binding on all other courts in the country but while passing the impugned order the learned Judge-in-Chamber had failed to follow the above mentioned, and many other, judgments rendered by this Court on the subject.", "It may be true that during the pendency of a petition filed in the nature of habeas corpus a court can pass a rule nisi regarding interim custody of the alleged detenue but it is unimaginable and unthinkable that after final disposition of such petition the alleged detenue, who was otherwise a free person, may be put to physical restraint or confinement for an indefinite period and that too not on the basis of any concrete fact or allegation but merely on the basis of an imagined possibility of commission of a sin or a crime.", "The learned Judge-in-Chamber ought to have known that it had been already been clarified by this Court in the case of Muhammad Rafique supra
